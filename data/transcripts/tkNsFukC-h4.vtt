a section by section analysis of the
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill which we're going to be
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
a memo
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
prepared by representative ames
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
on the statewide education property tax
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
reform that's contained in the bill as
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
well as a
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
memo prepared by attorney artinger and
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
they will be speaking to uh to both of
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
those as we as we go through things this
 
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.510 align:start position:0%
those as we as we go through things this
morning

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
as the chair noted back when the bill
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
was introduced a week and a half ago
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
it was late in the afternoon we did a we
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
introduced it from the 30 000 foot
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
view and i think the the objective today
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
is to uh is to go through this in
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
each of the 25 sections of the bill
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
and um and be able to uh to take
 
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.710 align:start position:0%
and um and be able to uh to take
questions

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the uh
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
from the members of the subcommittee uh
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
as we're going along
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
although i think neatly um groups of
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
these of these sections can sort of be
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
put into uh categories
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
like how do you develop a foundation
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget how do you fund these
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
budgets and then what is the uh what is
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
the tax impact so so we've sort of
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
organized our presentation to go through
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
the bill in that order it does go
 
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.990 align:start position:0%
the bill in that order it does go
chronologically

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
chronologically
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
and um and i'll i'll start again with
 
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
with just a couple minutes to uh to to
 
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
talk about the bill in general and then
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll get right into it but um but
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 1680 is uh is really a uh a
 
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
complete reform on how we
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
both cost and define cost and fund and
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
adequate education for all students in
 
00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire no matter where they
 
00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire no matter where they
live

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing it does is it defines
 
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional adequacy in terms of
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
student performance and that's been a
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
thing that we've heard for years here in
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
the house education committee is what
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
are we doing about student performance
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
how can we increase student performance
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
how can we improve student performance
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a that's the
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
fundamental objective behind house bill
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
1680. uh the second thing it does is it
 
00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
establishes a method to cost a
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget to allow
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
the students in every school every
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
school district across the state
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
to achieve a statewide outcome statewide
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes in new hampshire among the best
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the country it's been that way for
 
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
in the country it's been that way for
years

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.910 align:start position:0%
years
and

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh the concern is that it's just not
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
everywhere we're going to show that but
 
00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:08.310 align:start position:0%
everywhere we're going to show that but
this

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
house bill 1680
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
is directed to rectifying that
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
it also does two
 
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
two specific things it separates the
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
costing function from the funding
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
function so
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
you know it costs
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
it costs more to educate a thousand kids
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
in manchester than it does a thousand
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
kids in bedford and um
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
but uh but how you go about funding that
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
might be different in manchester than it
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
is than it is in bedford or other
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
communities across the state so we
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
separate costs from funding
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and then um and then very important
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
in the uh in the bill
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
and uh and tied with it is um is a
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful property tax relief program
 
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
that is directed to low and middle uh
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
low and middle income uh homeowners
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
uh and um and is is
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
puts the puts the
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
the state dollars that are that are
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
associated with this program directs
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
those dollars to where they're needed
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
most as opposed to you know some sort of
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
blanket um
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
property tax reduction based on your zip
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
code it's directed based on need
 
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.670 align:start position:0%
code it's directed based on need
um

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the um uh the
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1680 has both a transition
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
plan to ramp up the um
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
the funding of schools over a 10-year
 
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:29.269 align:start position:0%
the funding of schools over a 10-year
period

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's important that that schools be able
 
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
it's important that that schools be able
to

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
to use those dollars
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
and make those make those incremental
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
improvements it can't happen it won't
 
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
happen all at once so it ramps in over a
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
10-year period of time and it also plot
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
it also includes transition grants
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
for uh for communities that
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you know i'll use the term hold
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
harmless but it's not stabilization and
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
it ramps down over a five-year period as
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the um as the um as the foundation
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
budgets ramp up
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then finally and um and maybe one of
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
the most important things this bill does
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
is establish a clear and transparent
 
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.710 align:start position:0%
is establish a clear and transparent
accountability

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
to make sure that school districts are
 
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
to make sure that school districts are
spending

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
these funds in a way that lead to to
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and like i said the
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
student outcomes are measurable and the
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
accountability provision has um has
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
support so that um that if a district is
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
is falling behind or is not making the
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the um the strides that it needs to make
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
for their students that that the state
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
can come in and provide a little help
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and assistance for them to get there so
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's again just the uh the 30 000 uh
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
foot flyover and and if the chair is
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'll sort of move over to the
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the section by section
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we can start um
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
22 page bill rick
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
yep starting on page one let's start
 
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.470 align:start position:0%
yep starting on page one let's start
so

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
do you have a sheet that's going to
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
parallel going through the
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know that's this sheet okay you'll
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
so uh so thanks very much and i'll start
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
with with section one um section one uh
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
includes ten findings
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
that that largely stem from uh from the
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
work that was uh that was done um in the
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
school during the school funding
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
commission and uh and these findings
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
build on uh on each other
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
the um uh the first one um really says
 
00:13:34.639 --> 00:13:35.670 align:start position:0%
the um uh the first one um really says
that

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
elementary and secondary in education in
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
should um
 
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
should um
should

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
provide all students with the ability to
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
acquire knowledge and skills we've
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
talked about that in this committee the
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
importance not just knowledge it's
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
knowledge and skills
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
and it's done regardless of where
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
students live
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we're building on these opportunities
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the second one uh talks about an
 
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
integrated system of shared
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility between state and local
 
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
government to get students to a
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
statewide outcome and uh and and the
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
bill will be uh we'll be discussing that
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
but school districts
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
would then have the responsibility and
 
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility for implementing diverse
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
educational approaches to instruction
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
curriculum tailored to meet their
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
student needs we know that districts
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
across the state they're not all cookie
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
cutter they're not all the same
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
and it's important that uh that school
 
00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:32.710 align:start position:0%
and it's important that uh that school
boards

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
have that ability to um to to uh to and
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to uh to meet their
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
student needs whether you're in coast
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
county or you're here in merrimack
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
county dave yeah i wonder if i could
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
interject absolutely at any time yeah
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
i just want to underscore this
 
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
i just want to underscore this
particular

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh purpose that
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
is in uh
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
guess it's page one
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
of the act
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
anyway the first part of the act
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
the second purpose
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
respecting the long traditional
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
community involvement
 
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
provide an integrated system of shared
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility i think that's a
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
fundamental concept it's present already
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to work
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
with that concept you'll find it
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
throughout this bill
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
not the state it's not the localities
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's an integrated system of shared
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility where the state has its
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
role and the
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
school districts have their role
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
thank you very much dick
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i should have pointed
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
that out right at the top too that as we
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
go through this bill uh we're also we'll
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
be we'll be talking about the um the
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
court decisions that uh obviously new
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire has been through decades of uh
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
of court decisions that have shaped the
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh the school funding policy that's in
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
place today
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and obviously we're uh we're
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're waiting on um
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
on uh to hear what the the the supreme
 
00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
court sorry the superior court will do
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
with respect to the conval decision and
 
00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
then obviously that'll probably go up to
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
the supreme court after that so uh so
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving parts to this
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
and uh dave i i'd like to just if i
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
could just it's because this is a work
 
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
session we are working yeah we can
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
interact as well i'd like to follow up
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
to what uh representative ames just
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned referencing the shared
 
00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.670 align:start position:0%
mentioned referencing the shared
responsibility

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
if you have the statutes
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
in front of you which are
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
that we get here on the education
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee the very first statute
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
21n colon 1
 
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.870 align:start position:0%
21n colon 1
references

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what you said
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
so it's the first statute of book it
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
basically says the general court finds
 
00:16:53.189 --> 00:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
that the students parents general
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
citizenry local teachers and
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
administrators local governments local
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
school boards school administrative
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
units and state government have a joint
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
and shared responsibility for the
 
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
quality of education delivered through
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
the public education system in the state
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
so it's pretty clear
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
good go ahead no thank you thank you
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
very much rick for uh for pointing that
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
out and that's that's what's what's
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
meant here uh we'll also be talking
 
00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
about the shared responsibility in terms
 
00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
of funding um and adequate education too
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
so we'll get to that
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
in uh in just a little bit um in roman
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
three uh long history what you were just
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
talking about mr chair and where where
 
00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:34.710 align:start position:0%
talking about mr chair and where where
voters

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
approve budgets you know across the
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
state and i think that's reflective
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
of why
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has such strong outcomes
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
statewide compared to other states
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
across the country uh it it it clearly
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
reflects the voters the voters at every
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
school district meeting that have the
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
have the ex priority and high
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
expectation for student outcomes in
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
districts and that's uh that's one of
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
the hallmarks behind new hampshire's uh
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
public uh school system
 
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.070 align:start position:0%
public uh school system
so

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
roman four
 
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.549 align:start position:0%
roman four
um

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
defying the com concept of an adequate
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
education in terms of outcome and
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
performance and uh and being able to tie
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
that in with um with accountab
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
accountability because the performance
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
is measurable and we'll be talking more
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
about that as we go through go through
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
the the data that um that
 
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
was developed during the um during the
 
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
funding commission
 
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.350 align:start position:0%
funding commission
work

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
does indicate a strong correlation
 
00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:43.669 align:start position:0%
does indicate a strong correlation
between

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:45.270 align:start position:0%
between
poverty

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
poverty
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and um and student outcomes
 
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.190 align:start position:0%
and um and student outcomes
and

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
and probably mr chair
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
you you probably
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
recall some of these these bubble charts
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
from the from the school funding
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
commission work and this one in
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
particular is on page 27
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
and uh and where you uh where you take a
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
look at outcomes which currently based
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
on the data that's collected from the
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
department of education is performance
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
on standardized statewide
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
assessment tests
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
attendance rates and graduation rates
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
shows where
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're where shows that students in
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
school districts that have a a
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
high concentration of free and reduced
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
price lunch families so a lower
 
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.310 align:start position:0%
price lunch families so a lower
socioeconomic

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
capacity in those families have poorer
 
00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
outcomes and um and and that's something
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
that uh in new hampshire we want to uh
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
to try to uh try to address with uh with
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
this legislation and uh and and really
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
close that opportunity gap for um for
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
all students no matter where they uh
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
where they live or what their
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
backgrounds are
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
the um uh roman
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
roman six um
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh again a strong relationship
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
correlation between poverty and total
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
spending and that's another
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
another graph that comes out of the
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
school funding commission's work and
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
when you take a look at new hampshire
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
it's a highly regressive trend
 
00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
it's a highly regressive trend
as

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
as poverty increases spending deep
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
spending decreases substantially and you
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
compare that to massachusetts which
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
which has uh has pushed that in the
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
opposite opposite direction so uh so so
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know recognizing the fact that it
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
costs more to educate a thousand kids in
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
manchester than it does a thousand kids
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
in bedford or a thousand kids in
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
hopkinton i'll just pick on
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
pick on my town in that case is that all
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
right sue
 
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:53.669 align:start position:0%
right sue
okay

00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
let's see uh
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
wrapping into the final um the final few
 
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.350 align:start position:0%
wrapping into the final um the final few
um

00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh findings and this is where we're
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
really where we've built now on on the
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
past findings
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh roman seven talks about cost
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
the opportu what is the cost
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
for every school district to educate
 
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
their students to a statewide outcome so
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
that's separating the cost from the
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
funding and that cost is is done on a
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
school district by school district basis
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
regardless of where um where where you
 
00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:29.350 align:start position:0%
regardless of where um where where you
live

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
roman 8
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
is the funding um side of that that um
 
00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:36.310 align:start position:0%
is the funding um side of that that um
that

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
and again it goes back to the shared
 
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.669 align:start position:0%
and again it goes back to the shared
responsibility

00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
between the local government the local
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
school district and the and the state in
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
terms of being able to uh to make sure
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
that that funding is uh is adequate and
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uh to meet the foundation
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget where uh where some
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
towns we know across the state there's a
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
lot of communities that are working
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
super hard and just can't come close to
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
funding their budgets and this is
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
funding an adequate budget and this is
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
where the state comes in to make sure
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
that uh then it gets you there
 
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.950 align:start position:0%
that uh then it gets you there
um

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
let's see um
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
and then the the final um the final two
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh two findings in here
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh really uh really bring it all
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
together um where um where adequacy is
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
framed in terms of targeted outcomes
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
that facilitate a system public school
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
funding funding from the state state
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
sources to the communities with the
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
greatest need
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
to deliver a constitutionally adequate
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
education regardless of where the
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
student lives so providing that um that
 
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:41.909 align:start position:0%
student lives so providing that um that
that

00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
the gas where it's needed to make sure
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
that um uh that every school district
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
has access to the resources they need
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh the final uh finding here um
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
is um is tied to what we'll be talking
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
about it's in the bill but uh but we
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
ramp up the um the foundation
 
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan and we ramp uh we have
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
a transition grant that ramps down
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that uh that we don't
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
shock the system either way that we
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
don't um uh shock the system with
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budgets that um
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
that that give
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the the um uh system admin the the
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
district administration
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to uh to deploy those funds
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
in an effective and efficient manner and
 
00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
we don't shock the system in terms of um
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh sudden changes to uh to tax rates
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
and we think we've got a uh a good
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
proposal to address both those things so
 
00:23:42.159 --> 00:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
proposal to address both those things so
um

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh happy to take any questions on on the
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
findings but next up senator khan is
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
talk uh talk us through section two of
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
which um which is really um you know
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
jay's got uh you know big shoulders here
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
because um this is um this is really the
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
crux of um of the um of the of the
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
bill's um
 
00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.909 align:start position:0%
bill's um
um

00:24:09.909 --> 00:24:09.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh body where it uh really defines and
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
quantifies the state's obligations
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you david uh
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
chairman uh good to
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
see just my first house
 
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
during this session
 
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.029 align:start position:0%
during this session
uh

00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:29.909 --> 00:24:29.919 align:start position:0%
i think this is on
 
00:24:29.919 --> 00:24:31.110 align:start position:0%
i think this is on
uh

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
so let me uh
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
i will talk about cost
 
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.710 align:start position:0%
i will talk about cost
uh

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's the part of the study that
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
i spent the most time on
 
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.549 align:start position:0%
i spent the most time on
and

00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.909 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
we reviewed
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
costs education costs analyses that have
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
since the original claremont
 
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.830 align:start position:0%
since the original claremont
lawsuit

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
the the one that uh stands out for all
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
of us is the 2008
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh study
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh that is the joint legislative
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on costing an
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's dated february of
 
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.830 align:start position:0%
it's dated february of
2008.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
2008.
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's now 14 years old
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's an appropriate time to come back
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
and take a look
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
what did what were the recommendations
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
what did we implement uh what did we not
 
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
what did we implement uh what did we not
implement

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
implement
 
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
implement
uh

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
and uh is it getting us to where we need
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.549 align:start position:0%
to be
um

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
so in 2008 there was a strong
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
emphasis in that report
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
to arrive at a universal cost per
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
student that is the primary emphasis in
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
this report
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
and it's it's intended to be an
 
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:57.269 align:start position:0%
and it's it's intended to be an
accounting

00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:58.070 align:start position:0%
accounting
of

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
education costs
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh and that's what it does and and
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with it because we've
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
used it
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
our biennial budgeting for the last 14
 
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.870 align:start position:0%
our biennial budgeting for the last 14
years

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
and and what it is largely based on uh i
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
mean if you take the the total array of
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
student costs of the cost of a public
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
education in the state
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the 3.3 billion dollars that's spent
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
between state and local resources
 
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.350 align:start position:0%
between state and local resources
um

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
you you you know that
 
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.430 align:start position:0%
you you you know that
uh

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
60 percent to two-thirds of total cost
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
is instruction
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh when it rolls up the
 
00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
what is the accounting for instruction
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh it's based on a class size for k-2
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
of 25 students to one instructor
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
and for grades three through 12 at 30
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the department of
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
education's data
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
you'll find that the average
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
you won't find a single district that
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
has an average of 25
 
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.789 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:30.799 --> 00:27:32.230 align:start position:0%
so
one

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:35.919 align:start position:0%
the basic metric is is way off
 
00:27:35.919 --> 00:27:37.269 align:start position:0%
the basic metric is is way off
uh

00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
the second observation is uh that
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
the second cost driver is
 
00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
the second cost driver is
uh

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits for teachers
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
well the teacher cost is based on a
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
beginning teacher credential if you
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
think to
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
our statutes about
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
how teachers are credentialized
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
beginning teacher is anywhere between
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
zero and three years you've got to have
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
three years experience
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
and two positive evaluations to become
 
00:28:13.669 --> 00:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
an experienced teacher
 
00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.039 align:start position:0%
so we peg it
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
at the third year
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
of a beginning teacher
 
00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:20.310 align:start position:0%
of a beginning teacher
and

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
so it that that's deceptive because
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
that's certainly not the average cost of
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
an instructor
 
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the second is that the benefits are
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
pegged at 33 percent of the salary
 
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:35.430 align:start position:0%
pegged at 33 percent of the salary
so

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
we had testimony to the commission from
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
school business officers that said nope
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's really 58
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
is the benefit cost
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
so we've got the three primary drivers
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
on two thirds of the cost uh
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
pegged at
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
numbers that
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
just don't
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't jive and that's why we probably
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
have lawsuits that perpetuate to this
 
00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.590 align:start position:0%
have lawsuits that perpetuate to this
day

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.190 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
the other thing to recognize is that the
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
universal cost that was recommended in
 
00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.990 align:start position:0%
universal cost that was recommended in
2008

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
2008
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
is 3400
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
let me get this right 34
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
156 dollars per pupil
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and what we have in the budget is
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
six dollars
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh the point being
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
in fourteen years that total
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
cost that universal cost has moved ten
 
00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.389 align:start position:0%
cost that universal cost has moved ten
percent

00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh which is
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
another defying
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
and then the third thing to take into
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
account is uh
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
the differentiated costs
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
because one of the things that the 2008
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
study did is it benchmarked against
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
national uh variables that where other
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
states were using
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
and employed some pretty good ideas
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
about english learning students
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
english language learning students being
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
a more expensive
 
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.789 align:start position:0%
a more expensive
investment

00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
investment
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
to bring that student up to
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
an adequacy adequate level
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
it it recognizes uh special needs of
 
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.950 align:start position:0%
it it recognizes uh special needs of
students

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
special education needs
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
the uh economically
 
00:30:37.679 --> 00:30:38.710 align:start position:0%
the uh economically
uh

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
economic differences poverty index uh of
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
students so these are things that are
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
brought into the formula we do have
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
differentiated ratios we just didn't
 
00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919 align:start position:0%
implement them at the levels that were
 
00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:52.310 align:start position:0%
implement them at the levels that were
recommended

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
in a for instance special education was
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
recommended as a two-tiered
 
00:30:58.159 --> 00:31:00.710 align:start position:0%
recommended as a two-tiered
cost

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
one that recognized in in-district
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
placement and one that recognized an
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
out-of-district placement
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
we we don't do that
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh in our formula
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
we peg it at the lowest number that we
 
00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.230 align:start position:0%
we peg it at the lowest number that we
could

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
which is the lower tier as recommended
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
in the 2008 study
 
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:21.990 align:start position:0%
in the 2008 study
um

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.509 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
again we we just we don't have uh we
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
didn't implement it and that was uh iris
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
esther brooks
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
be moaning
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh as a
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
2008 commissioner uh as she participated
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
in our uh 2020 study
 
00:31:39.919 --> 00:31:41.669 align:start position:0%
in our uh 2020 study
uh

00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
so those are the characteristics
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
well i know we'll get back to it yep uh
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
when senator estabrook
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and company
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
put this together back in 2008
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
um when we were looking at the special
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
ed the tearing you said we we didn't get
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
to the two-tiered
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh i understand we don't have weighted
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh formula
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
based because due to the amount of time
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
or an amount of service
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the type of service that an individual
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
might require but we do didn't we have
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
basically two tiers in fact we had the
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
the amount that stated within
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
but we had set aside another area
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
statute cap aid
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
which provided the additional amount for
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
the student which was being serviced
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
oftentimes either out of district or out
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
of state
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
so i guess
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
we we had two tiers
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
of a sort
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
but we did not tier the first category
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
at all
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
chairman land uh
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
but let me give you the
 
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
another chunk that'll
 
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
you probably are going to be surprised
 
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.110 align:start position:0%
you probably are going to be surprised
the

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
the self-contained
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh or in building special education uh
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
was the higher tier
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the 2008 study so it wasn't the out
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
of district as you say that has a
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
categorical aid element
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
and a different basis on how that's
 
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
and a different basis on how that's
distributed

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
it's the self-contained that was
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to be reimbursed at three
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
thousand six hundred and ten
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
dollars uh
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're at two thousand dollars
 
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
you know we're at two thousand dollars
today

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
so and and that's gone up you know kind
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
of significantly in the last two years
 
00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah we never never got the 3600
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
per in district
 
00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:41.590 align:start position:0%
per in district
self-contained

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
self-contained
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
special education student
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay let's go let's go on with where
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
you're going i i perhaps we can come
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
back and we'll discuss all these points
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
which been brought up a little bit more
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
in detail
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
this is certainly an area where there's
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of discussion
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh as well it can be yeah uh
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
and i i'll not get diverted i'll not
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
take that that side that side that's
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
right let's let's keep marching here
 
00:34:09.119 --> 00:34:10.310 align:start position:0%
right let's let's keep marching here
um

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.669 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.270 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
as david said uh you know what so what's
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
the alternative
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
if what we've been working with is not
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh getting us to the outcomes that we
 
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.310 align:start position:0%
uh getting us to the outcomes that we
desire

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
desire
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
what is the method to get us there and
 
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:31.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh using an outcome-based
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
definition which
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
picking it up from state statutes in
 
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.270 align:start position:0%
picking it up from state statutes in
193e

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
193e
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
we developed three
 
00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:44.790 align:start position:0%
we developed three
measures

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
one is graduation rates
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
another it's attendance rates and the
 
00:34:52.149 --> 00:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
third is the standardized test scores
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
three through eight plus uh the
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
sophomore year in high school
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh we use ten years worth of data so
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
it's not like we fixed on a certain
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
point in time we were able i mean that's
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
a bunch of school districts
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
and their 10-year performance levels
 
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.630 align:start position:0%
and their 10-year performance levels
uh

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
working into the data
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and we used regression modeling and
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
the thing about regression modeling is
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you're aiming towards averages
 
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.990 align:start position:0%
that you're aiming towards averages
right

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and deviations from the averages ought
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
to create some deviation in
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
how much we reimburse so if we know what
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
the statewide average is
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
in all those metrics which as david said
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
our metrics are high
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
in overall performance
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
then we know how much each district has
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
of students
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
that deviate or exceed
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
the statewide average
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
and that becomes a basis for the cost
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
no surprise
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
those same metrics that
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
were used in the 2008 formula until
 
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.589 align:start position:0%
were used in the 2008 formula until
today

00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
for differentiated aid still hold up
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
they still make a difference and they
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
define the difference in student outcome
 
00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:14.470 align:start position:0%
define the difference in student outcome
performance

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
performance
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
in every school district across the
 
00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:18.790 align:start position:0%
in every school district across the
state

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
english learning poverty special
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
education needs are those unique student
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
characteristics in each district that
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
need to be accounted for
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
and we we can tell by the state average
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
how much
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
each of those
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
student characteristics cost
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
to get to a state average
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
we also know that the districts have
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
certain characteristics that make a
 
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.550 align:start position:0%
certain characteristics that make a
difference

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.589 align:start position:0%
difference
a

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
small district
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
you might raise the question of that and
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
chairman you might remember your your
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
question about that is that a district
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
small by choice
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
or is this small by regional
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
circumstance we didn't differentiate on
 
00:37:13.359 --> 00:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
circumstance we didn't differentiate on
that

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
but we did recognize that small
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
matters and that it's higher cost as you
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
spread it across the student we also
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
recognized that contrary to the 2008
 
00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.510 align:start position:0%
recognized that contrary to the 2008
study

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
study
that

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's not the elementary education level
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
that has a higher cost
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
its middle school has the highest cost
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
and then high school has a higher cost
 
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
than elementary school
 
00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.349 align:start position:0%
than elementary school
and

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
so we were able statistically to verify
 
00:37:48.119 --> 00:37:49.910 align:start position:0%
so we were able statistically to verify
that

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that that's wrapped into
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
the school characteristics that
 
00:37:56.079 --> 00:37:57.589 align:start position:0%
the school characteristics that
require

00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
an additional
funding

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:02.829 align:start position:0%
funding
costing

00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
costing
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
element um
 
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.349 align:start position:0%
element um
so

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh section
 
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.870 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh section
uh

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
three in the study
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
you'll find a series of ratios that
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
relate both to student
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
district characteristics
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
all aimed
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
at trying to bring
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
each district
 
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
the resources necessary to educate the
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
student population that they have
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
unique to that school
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
in that district and that town
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
basis of the costing study
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
at a high level
 
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
at a high level
and

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
we need any q a glad to turn to that but
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh if there's
 
00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
a progression here i know it it moves to
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
another part of the bill that i'm not
 
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
prepared to go into
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and i'm sorry i don't
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
have my book with me and i'm really not
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
that familiar in your model of this
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
costing are the different the three
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
different areas weighted differently
 
00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
like like does um attendance rate count
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
more than state assessment rate or how
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
does that work
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
they're melded together
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
and produce what's called in the study a
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
z score
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
are then melded together into a single
 
00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.349 align:start position:0%
are then melded together into a single
score

00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
score
 
00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's how
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're able to
 
00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
consistently apply this in a fairly
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
simple manner
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
so let's say
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
district a has a wonderful attendance
 
00:40:12.319 --> 00:40:13.510 align:start position:0%
district a has a wonderful attendance
rate

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.740 align:start position:0%
rate
fantastic

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:14.750 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.150 align:start position:0%
fantastic
[Music]

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
graduation rate but low state assessment
 
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.829 align:start position:0%
graduation rate but low state assessment
rates

00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
how each one it's just a plus b plus c
 
00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
divided by three and that's your score
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
or um how does that work um actually uh
 
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
test scores relate
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
account for about
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
85 to 90 percent of the overall weight
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
and that's because those other two
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
weights are explained by the test scores
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
meaning sorry
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
a district
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
that has
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
a low attendance rate
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
or a low graduation rate also has low
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
test scores
 
00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:55.510 align:start position:0%
test scores
so

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
but but it but it it it does vary
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
it does vary and you're right
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
they do vary and that's why the three
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
measures are appropriate to to be
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
considered not to get stuck on a single
 
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.829 align:start position:0%
considered not to get stuck on a single
measure

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
measure
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
but to recognize that all three of these
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
are factors that
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
contribute to the outcomes
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
so were any other factors considered
 
00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
besides those three
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
i get really nervous when everything is
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
based on ones
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
85 percent of it is based on a
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
standardized test score and that really
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
makes me nervous
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
i was comfortable with
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
having it be a little bit differently
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
weighted but it still i think puts a
 
00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.630 align:start position:0%
weighted but it still i think puts a
disadvantage

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
disadvantage
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
on some districts and i'm wondering
 
00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
if anything else was considered like the
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
number of kids who go on to grad
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
colleges and graduate schools and the
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
number of people who go into the
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
military and what professions they
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
choose and what degrees they earn
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
afterwards and those kinds of things
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
which are also indicators of a school's
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
quality i would think
 
00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:06.309 align:start position:0%
quality i would think
right

00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
this whole formula there's a
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
a lot to it i understand that and i've
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
been through it with the commission
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
but one of the areas which
 
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'm still foggy on
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.069 align:start position:0%
is that
i

00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
we're driving to try to find out what it
 
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
we're driving to try to find out what it
costs

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
to have a student in this state all
 
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.349 align:start position:0%
to have a student in this state all
students

00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
get to that performance outcome that
 
00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:37.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking to achieve
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
or have
 
00:42:39.359 --> 00:42:40.150 align:start position:0%
or have
and

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
when we come down to special services
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
special education there's a certain
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
percentage of that total amount which is
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to be allocated out my concern is
 
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.829 align:start position:0%
going to be allocated out my concern is
then

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
when we're going to fund all special ed
 
00:42:54.319 --> 00:42:55.270 align:start position:0%
when we're going to fund all special ed
kids

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
at the same weighted amount that kind of
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
rings a bell in my head saying that's
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
not true we have some kids which are a
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
half hour a week other kids that are
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
full time with supported staff and
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
services which are very costly
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
critical concern to me that we when
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're when we're looking at
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
whatever that
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
amount might be if it's four point
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
something times what the
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
the base cost is
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
then then is that for all kids or are
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
there different weights
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
associated with a child that has a
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
learning disability versus that that has
 
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
learning disability versus that that has
a

00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
severe emotional mental
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh handicap in the area that that's
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.079 --> 00:43:53.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
we were unable to get that information
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
00:43:59.599 --> 00:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
from the department
uh

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
and it's because in smaller districts
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh it becomes a an identifying
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
you can identify and associate by grade
 
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.069 align:start position:0%
you can identify and associate by grade
level

00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:13.750 align:start position:0%
level
uh

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
particular students in that school
 
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.230 align:start position:0%
particular students in that school
so

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
we were unable to
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
to get that granular a level of
 
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
information i will say as i prepared
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
last night and i was looking for more
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
information about student costs
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
we do have some student costs i mean
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
about special education at district
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
levels in the doe 25
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
20 000 more
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
per special education student
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
and that's an average
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
but that's what it is
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
you know when we were able to attribute
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
the costs for different student
 
00:44:57.119 --> 00:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
the costs for different student
variables

00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
variables
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
the base cost wound up at six thousand
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
the total cost was seventeen thousand
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
dollars a student
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
the base cost was six thousand dollars
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
meaning we could explain all the other
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
outcome differences with all the other
 
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
outcome differences with all the other
costs

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
costs
uh

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.670 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:45:17.359 --> 00:45:18.710 align:start position:0%
special education
uh

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
there you go it's on average twenty
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars the ratio here is a
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
four four time four x
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh number and and it pans out
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that is the extra that stupid
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
school districts are reporting for a
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
special education student and i i get it
 
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.589 align:start position:0%
special education student and i i get it
chairman

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
if we had the data
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
you might be able to differentiate it
 
00:45:44.069 --> 00:45:44.079 align:start position:0%
but we know that there are 30 000 30 000
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
ieps in the state and
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
they're costing significantly in the
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
districts that have a higher
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of i know it'd be very
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
difficult senator to break
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
a weighted amount
 
00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.550 align:start position:0%
a weighted amount
out

00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do it the way some
 
00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:02.079 align:start position:0%
states do do that they have that
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
information provided to the department
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
we do have the department knowledgeable
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
of the the types of handicapping
 
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
conditions we can get that total
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
information that is available it's on
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
the web
 
00:46:13.839 --> 00:46:15.270 align:start position:0%
the web
however

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
within those categories
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of of difference i i
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
think that this is one area
 
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:23.750 align:start position:0%
think that this is one area
that

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
we need to as legislators to drive home
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
to department of education
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
we need the information
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
to really round this thing out properly
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that might be one of the
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
expectations that we can you know put
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
down the side as
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
does the doe
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
really reflect
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for as far as the
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate does the special
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
information we have here having to rely
 
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
information we have here having to rely
upon

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to delve and dig into it a
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
little bit more with the department and
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's time maybe that we have them start
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking at that doe 25 form and revising
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
it to give us the more specific i
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the way we're going to
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
have to get a little bit more down in
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead yep yep mr chair uh later on in
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
the bill there's a whole section on data
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
collection where where where the bill
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
um uh suggests uh additional pieces of
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
data that the department could collect
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
and that uh could go into um to later
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
revisions of of
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
developing um you know measuring uh
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
student outcomes by district and uh and
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
also factoring into the um
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
a uh you know the funding or i'm sorry
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
the costing formula that um uh that this
 
00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
used but but currently we're using 10
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
years of department data that that were
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
available to the to the commission and
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh like senator khan said
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the detailed breakdown in special
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
education categories was only available
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
for one year
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
and um and uh and and not broken out in
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
um in in prior years
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
but uh but i think what's uh what's
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
what's very clear though is um is you
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
know if the um if a future funding i'm
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
sorry a future costing formula
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
was was going to leverage that that
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
additional granularity in special
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
education categories that the department
 
00:48:30.549 --> 00:48:30.559 align:start position:0%
could in fact do that because they do
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
have that information
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
there there is some information that we
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
could take and tear apart
 
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
they do list all those handicapped
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
conditions and the number of students
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
per district that are
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
associated with that type of a handicap
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
right it's just not publicly available
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
data well we got numbers we got numbers
 
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have the ieps if you look on
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
the web those numbers that we have in
 
00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
the state are there we've gone way back
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
you can go back a good 10 15 years and
 
00:49:02.309 --> 00:49:02.319 align:start position:0%
collect that information it is there but
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
we don't know
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at for example a child
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
that has a learning disability it
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us any information we could
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
get the maybe the
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
i don't even think we could find the
 
00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:16.640 align:start position:0%
average cost of the learning disability
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
handicap first the the average cost of
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
another handicap
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
because there is such a variance within
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
these handicaps at the cost and within
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
an individual
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh based upon the iep there's a huge
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
variance as well
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes in years ago we used to be
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
able to count a kid as being monitored
 
00:49:39.359 --> 00:49:40.549 align:start position:0%
able to count a kid as being monitored
um

00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
when they're coming out of that iep that
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
they've had we don't have that condition
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
anymore but if we'd had it we would be
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
funding a monitored child that's in the
 
00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
classroom and not really receiving any
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
help now because they're on our way
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're exiting the iep program
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that would have been funded a huge
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
amount of money and uh i don't want to
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
see administrators chasing this money
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
seeing that it provides a real huge hunk
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
of dollar
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know if you take your six thousand
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
dollars multiplied by four
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money right right so
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
just sort of getting us back
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
um no and and
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
i absolutely appreciate that um but just
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
um getting us back to the bill so that
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
we can go through going through the
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
sections yeah the uh what uh what center
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
khan's talking about here is um is we
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
have that information from the doe 25s
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
to you know the granularity that it that
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
that exists today
 
00:50:41.589 --> 00:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
and um and we know for every school
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
district with
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
a certain with with uh with a student
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
population with certain characteristics
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
and and certain district characteristics
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
like how many students are in elementary
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
how many students in middle how many
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
students are in high school
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
and the budgets that are spent the money
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
that is spent in each of those
 
00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
elementary middle and and high school
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
and we also know the the outcome data
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
for uh for each of these districts so
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's using that mass of information
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
for every district in the um in the
 
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.990 align:start position:0%
for every district in the um in the
state

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
each of the districts specific outcomes
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
each of the districts specific student
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and school characteristics that
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
we can then calculate and this is what
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh senator kahn's talking about in
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
section three
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
then calculate what a um what a budget
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
would be or would would
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
predict what a budget should be
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
in order for
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
the outcome in any district to be um to
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
be a a statewide average so what would
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
it be what would a budget in manchester
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
need to be so that the average student
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
in manchester was performing at a
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
statewide average
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the fifth percentile right
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
now what would the budget in hopkinton
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
for the average student at hopkinton to
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
perform at a statewide average as
 
00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:08.720 align:start position:0%
opposed to the 82nd percentile as uh as
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
is right now so state average would be
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
the 50th percentile so so some districts
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
would would see a foundation opportunity
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
budget less than what they're currently
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
spending some districts would see a
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget more than
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
what they're current uh currently
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
spending in order so that the average
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
student in those districts is performing
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
at a state level i i understand all that
 
00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
just take an example of waterville
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
valley what's happened in the last year
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
their economy of scale we talked about
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
that a little bit uh previously here
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
outside of school district etc and and
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
we know that it costs more to run a
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
school with fewer students look at
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
what's happened there by increasing by
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
70 students up there the cost per pupil
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
has gone down significantly
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's economy of scale
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
so and
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
so i'm jumping off a little bit i'm
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
sorry uh let's let's keep going with the
 
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
conversation here uh certainly special
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
services is going to be a uh
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
a larger discussion as we get going here
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
in in this whole thing um mr chair yes i
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
just want to i i i'm hoping this is
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
where you have there um thank you for
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
letting me participate in this work
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
session i really appreciate it just to
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
sum up
 
00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
senator khan
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
went through sections two
 
00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
went through sections two
three

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
and four
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill with his remarks that's on
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
page three
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
oh well we haven't gone through all
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:45.109 align:start position:0%
oh well we haven't gone through all
pages

00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
i haven't touched it yet but let me just
 
00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839 align:start position:0%
in terms of the concept i just want to
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
take a step back
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i am kind of from the legal side of
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
things which education funding has been
 
00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:58.870 align:start position:0%
things which education funding has been
a

00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
legal issue that has plagued our state
 
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
legal issue that has plagued our state
for

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
decades now
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
that what section two does
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
is define
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
as the state-wide
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
average so there's the target that's in
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
terms of outcomes
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
what section three does
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
is determine
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
the value
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
of achieving
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
that adequacy definition
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
in each district it differs by district
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
because of the reasons
 
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative luna said and then what
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
section four does
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
is provide
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
an easy way
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
to translate in terms of non-complicated
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
data analysis
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
which is very similar to the way the
 
00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
state has done it in the past
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
of of using weightings of data that is
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
available and representative not just
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
outcome data this is other data like
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
free and reduced launch stuff that we're
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with and it uses that data
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
what amount
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
is necessary in each district to allow
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
it to achieve the definition of an
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
adequate education from a court
 
00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.309 align:start position:0%
adequate education from a court
perspective

00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
this is one of the first bills
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
that is so clear
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
on how we're achieving the required
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional effort using
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
the shared governance
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
that representative aims talked about
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
between representative land state and
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
local government maintaining that
 
00:55:49.829 --> 00:55:49.839 align:start position:0%
balance which as we all know the
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
evidence is clear new hampshire's common
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
public school system k through 12 is
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
producing right now
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
high quality outcomes
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
for on average so our goal is with this
 
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
structure defining educa adequate
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
education in terms of a target
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
performance level
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
costing what it costs to get there to
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
enable a district to get there given
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
their unique circumstances what we're
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do is address
 
00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
where in the state we have opportunity
 
00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.549 align:start position:0%
where in the state we have opportunity
gaps

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
gaps
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
the state side of the partnership will
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
lay in
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
more support
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
to help that district close the gap for
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
its students between the target and
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
where it is now that's what sections two
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
three and four
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
do as a matter of
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
concept and it lays it out almost in a
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
step-by-step way
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
every 10 years
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
you've got to recalculate
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
using new data
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
at least every ten years
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
where the gap is what that means
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
is that for the first time
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
rather than the current system which is
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
based on cost you could spend
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know fifty dollars on computers in
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
one district and fifty dollars in
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
computers on another district
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
and get completely different performance
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
levels depending on the unique
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
attributes of those districts what this
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
does is actually set out data
 
00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
every ten years at least that says
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
is that district with all its unique
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
attributes achieving
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
the goal of adequacy that is determined
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
by this legislature and so i just wanted
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
to take a step back from
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
the details and the weeds
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
are the most important always it is
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
but you've got to start with the
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
concepts in a sense and in two three and
 
00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:50.950 align:start position:0%
concepts in a sense and in two three and
four

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
just bang
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
bang you know what is the definition
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
it is not in terms of costs or dollars
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's in terms of a goal
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
an outcome because what do parents care
 
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:03.430 align:start position:0%
an outcome because what do parents care
about

00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
they don't care about how much money
 
00:58:09.750 --> 00:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
a school is paying for a library
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
they care whether their child is getting
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
a good outcome and being prepared for
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
the world
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
and so this bill is more aligned with
 
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:19.589 align:start position:0%
and so this bill is more aligned with
that

00:58:19.589 --> 00:58:19.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
today we're able to have more data than
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
we had 20 years ago which allows us to
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
make the shift at this time and as a
 
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
member of the commission which chairman
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
ladd was on and the others here what was
 
00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
magical is to hear from a national
 
00:58:35.430 --> 00:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
expert for the first time in new
 
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:36.789 align:start position:0%
expert for the first time in new
hampshire

00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
national experts say that this data
 
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.870 align:start position:0%
national experts say that this data
allows

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
for a methodology that really truly
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
focuses on
 
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.829 align:start position:0%
focuses on
results

00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
and results is what we all focus on i'm
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
sorry representative i just wanted to
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
take that step because the details are
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes confusing
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
but the goals are clear thank you
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
okay we're not at 30 000 feet we're down
 
00:59:03.910 --> 00:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
about 25 000 feet now get us lower
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
represent luno
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair to um uh
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
let's let's all just sort of turn to
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
page four because i think that's where
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
um where you'll you'll recognize some
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
similarities as bill larger
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
was speaking to similarity between
 
00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill and what's in in
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
current statute and so
 
00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:28.559 align:start position:0%
section section four
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
basically re-codifies um 198 colon 40 a
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
which is what determines the cost of
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
inadequate education so as as bill laid
 
00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.829 align:start position:0%
inadequate education so as as bill laid
out

00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
adequate education is based on
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
performance based on outcomes based on
 
00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:45.829 align:start position:0%
performance based on outcomes based on
results

00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
the next session
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
how do you cost that out and then this
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
section section four
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
going on to page four how do you easily
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
develop a formula to be able to
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
determine what that cost
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
for a for a um uh for an average student
 
01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
in every district to to have a statewide
 
01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:08.710 align:start position:0%
in every district to to have a statewide
outcome

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
and um and these these
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
in this case they are called weights but
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
um in another terminology call them
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid factors which is what
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
we have in the uh in the current statute
 
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
we have in the uh in the current statute
but

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
through the analysis that was done in in
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
section three
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
um you can um you can you can
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
you can scientif you can derive
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
what uh what the weights are and um and
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
specifically for um for a a
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
student that uh that is that that gets
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
free and reduced price lunch
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
it would be 1.49
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
times the base
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
remember the base is 6 500 that's online
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
30 on page on page four 6501
 
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:58.710 align:start position:0%
30 on page on page four 6501
so

01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:58.720 --> 01:00:59.510 align:start position:0%
so
so

01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
so the way you build up this cost of an
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
for a school district to educate their
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
students to a statewide outcome
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
it starts with the um the enrollment
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
data uh in this case it's adma and i
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
think we are moving towards admr um as
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
nate and mark have have talked with us
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
so you know these are things that
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
that need to be need to be done but it's
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
the enrollment times the base
 
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
the enrollment times the base
plus

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
plus
 
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
plus
the

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
number of students that are in free and
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch times the base
 
01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.789 align:start position:0%
reduced price lunch times the base
times

01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
the weighting factor of 1.49
 
01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
same with special education number of
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
students with in special education times
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
the base
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
times 4.29 and that gets to what senator
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
khan was was talking about
 
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
from the uh you know from the earlier
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
data the cost of special education
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then and then on for english
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
language learners it's 2.2 is the factor
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then enrollment
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
total enrollment in a school district
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
and there's factors
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
going from small schools which would
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
have a factor of 1.08 to larger schools
 
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.510 align:start position:0%
have a factor of 1.08 to larger schools
0.57.43

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
0.57.43
 
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.829 align:start position:0%
0.57.43
0.24

01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
0.24
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
those are all uh in here
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment in um and actually the
 
01:02:31.599 --> 01:02:32.870 align:start position:0%
enrollment in um and actually the
enrollment

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
the uh uh
 
01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
what i was just reading from here is
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
right out of the commission report those
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
are specific points at um
 
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
at enrollment levels like 200 students
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
600 students 1200 students
 
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.470 align:start position:0%
600 students 1200 students
and

01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:47.430 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
the the bill actually uses a smoothing
 
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.789 align:start position:0%
the the bill actually uses a smoothing
factor

01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
factor
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know sort of a cliff effect when
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're going from 200 students to 201
 
01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
you're going from 200 students to 201
students

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
you know you lose you you would lose
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
that that funding so it smooths that out
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
um and then and then factors that also
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
include uh
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
um waiting for the for middle grades uh
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
1.42 and high school at 0.42
 
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.309 align:start position:0%
1.42 and high school at 0.42
um

01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.109 align:start position:0%
so so
so

01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
these factors when taken all together
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
are are really differentiated aid
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
you know categories like what we have in
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
in present law
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
and and provide the department
 
01:03:36.069 --> 01:03:36.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to annually calculate what
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
what the cost for
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
for a foundation opportunity budget for
 
01:03:42.789 --> 01:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
school district to educate all of its
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
students to a statewide outcome
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be much the way it calculates the
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions of
 
01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative luna or members of that
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
team that are here right now
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
yes represent like us
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
how did you come up kind of briefly how
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
did you come up with the particular
 
01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.349 align:start position:0%
did you come up with the particular
numbers

01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
that you did
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
so so thanks for the question
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative lakis um that's what uh
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
senator khan was referring to the
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
regression analysis
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
and in this case it would be called a
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
multi-variant regression analysis where
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
you take a look at the the um the costs
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
in every district the costs that are
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
broken down in the doe 25 and the
 
01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
results the student performance outcome
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
that you get in them in that district
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
and you you you basically
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
um draw a line through the um
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
through through
 
01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:44.390 align:start position:0%
through through
through

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
every district in the state and you you
 
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:48.799 align:start position:0%
do this not not physically drawing a
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
line but uh but but through uh through a
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
multivariate regression analysis and it
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
basically associates
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
the amount of each of those budgets
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um that that is associated with let's
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
say free and reduced price lunch
 
01:05:07.589 --> 01:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
enrollment or special education number
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
students in special education or the
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
number of english language learners and
 
01:05:13.829 --> 01:05:13.839 align:start position:0%
it tries to find or i should say it
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
finds the best fit line that reduces the
 
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.549 align:start position:0%
finds the best fit line that reduces the
error

01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
error
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
because not every district is going to
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
spend exactly the same dollars on on
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
special education students or exactly
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
the same have the same costs for free
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
and reduce reduced price lunch student
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
or an ell student every district is
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit different
 
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
but when you take a look at all those
 
01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
districts across the state you can
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
actually find a best fit line that that
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
shows well on average this is what the
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
cost is
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
uh the the cost impact is for
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
in a budget for every free and reduced
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
price launch student for every english
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
language learner for every special
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
education and then for the the factors
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
that um that pertain to
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
district characteristics like school
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
size middle school and high school
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's i'm you know i'm sorry it's sort
 
01:06:11.829 --> 01:06:11.839 align:start position:0%
of like a
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
long-winded geeky you know answer on on
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
how you go about calculating it but but
 
01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
it is called a
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
regression you know a multivariate
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
regression analysis
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have uh we actually have um a full
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
throated briefs
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
that were prepared by the uh by our
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
research team who uh who performed that
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to uh to email you
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the links um uh to those
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so those are based on current
 
01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
spending as
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
correct based on fy 19 okay that's yeah
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah fy 19 doe 25s
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay let's keep rolling
 
01:07:00.390 --> 01:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
so um so that sort of takes us through
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
section four which on page four and and
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
goes to the top of page five and um
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
and we've sort of um
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
i think uh bill looks like he has uh
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
had to maybe jump out and take a call
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
but we're on to section five
 
01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh bill was going to talk to that
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
but i'm happy to uh uh to to introduce
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
it so
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
everything we've talked about so far so
 
01:07:26.559 --> 01:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
everything we've talked about so far so
far

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
far
 
01:07:30.069 --> 01:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
gets us to a cost
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
a budget to get a district to a to a
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
statewide outcome now we're talking
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
about the funding side of
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
of this argument of this plan
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.789 align:start position:0%
the um
uh

01:07:46.789 --> 01:07:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
the first thing that that i think needs
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
to be needs to be explained here
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
01:07:55.589 --> 01:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
and this is really sort of it's talked
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
about in in roman four
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh down on begins on line 28 on page
 
01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.750 align:start position:0%
uh down on begins on line 28 on page
five

01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and while while the foundation
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for every district
 
01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
has been has been calculated in in
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
section four
 
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:12.470 align:start position:0%
section four
this

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1680 looks at
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
the way it's drafted here is eight years
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
but we're really looking at a ten year
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
phase in of this um of this foundation
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan so i'll hand it over to
 
01:08:24.159 --> 01:08:25.030 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan so i'll hand it over to
bill

01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and again
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
i apologize i
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
have some issues with my elderly parents
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
in cornish new hampshire where i was a
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative and i was just i had to
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
step out for a minute so thank you very
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
much for
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
letting me do that
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
so section five on page five
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is the almost the easiest part of
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's simple math
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
it says after you've defined and what an
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education is
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
after you've determined
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
what the value of that adequate
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
education is
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
in every district based on the
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
district's circumstances by getting a
 
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.829 align:start position:0%
district's circumstances by getting a
foundation

01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget that's the amount of
 
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget that's the amount of
money

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
that this methodology predicts is the
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
amount they need to spend
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
to achieve the statistical the outcome
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
goal that is our definition
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
what you have that foundation
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget how do you get from
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
to what we all care about which is the
 
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
state budget grant that each district
 
01:09:32.159 --> 01:09:33.510 align:start position:0%
state budget grant that each district
gets

01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
gets
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
take the foundation opportunity budget
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
which may be different by district
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
subtract from it
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
an amount called the minimum local
 
01:09:44.159 --> 01:09:45.749 align:start position:0%
an amount called the minimum local
contribution

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
minimum local contribution remember
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative ames focusing on the
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
finding partnership between
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
state government and local government
 
01:09:59.110 --> 01:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
all integrated to achieve a goal
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for our students
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
what you do is the minimum local
 
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.270 align:start position:0%
what you do is the minimum local
contribution

01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
is an amount that every district is
 
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.310 align:start position:0%
is an amount that every district is
required

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
to put on the table
 
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.149 align:start position:0%
to put on the table
towards

01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
local public education k-12 that you
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
know the common school that their kids
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
are that they're required to fund
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
what is that amount we got to determine
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
an amount
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum local contribution
 
01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:28.630 align:start position:0%
the minimum local contribution
is

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand
 
01:10:31.679 --> 01:10:32.790 align:start position:0%
five dollars per thousand
times

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.390 align:start position:0%
times
the

01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
valuation of their tax base so it's
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
nothing tricky
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
local communities have been determining
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
things in terms of their local property
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
tax base which is the only tax base that
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state government
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
has granted power to local communities
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
to raise dollars to fund a minimum
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
contribution like this so
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget let's
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
assume for a community
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh a million dollars
 
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.510 align:start position:0%
uh a million dollars
minus

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
minus
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
the minimum local contribution let's
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
assume five dollars per thousand let's
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
just assume right now 500 000.
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
so you take
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
the million
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
minus the 500 000
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
what's the balance 500 000 and then you
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
multiply it by two percentages in this
 
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.470 align:start position:0%
multiply it by two percentages in this
formula

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
one is an efficiency percentage
 
01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.350 align:start position:0%
one is an efficiency percentage
95

01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
95
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
why did we choose that because
 
01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
there's always a little bit and i'm
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to ask dave luno to talk about
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more there's always a
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
of differential between the perfect goal
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
of statewide average
 
01:11:48.159 --> 01:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
of statewide average
and

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
and
some

01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
various components that would say let's
 
01:11:54.870 --> 01:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
make it 95
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
then you have to multiply it by another
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
percentage so we've got
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
the million minus the 500 000 equals 500
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
000 times the 95 percent
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
then we get to multiply by the
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
transition percentage representative
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
luno already said the reason we're
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
transitioning this
 
01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
is not to shock any system one of the
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
failures over my years of working on ed
 
01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
funding and i've worked on it since i've
 
01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
funding and i've worked on it since i've
for

01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
for decades since 1993
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
with various uh elected officials the
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
is that we're always
 
01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:32.310 align:start position:0%
is that we're always
not

01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're always jumping a whole system in
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
place and then there's stabilization aid
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
or there's whole harmless grants it's
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
very confusing this is a nice
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
smooth glide path
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
will need an amendment
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
and representative luna was referred to
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
that it is a goal of of this group
 
01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
that came out of the commission is a
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
10-year flight plan a glide path so that
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
you would start
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the 70 range
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
and you would ultimately get up to 100
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the 10-year period
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
there would be no more reduction
 
01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
as you're phasing in this grant level
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
um for a community
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
like manchester which has as i think we
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
can all recognize has some of the
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
greatest challenges
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
of any community in terms of
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
just attributes like special ed like
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
poverty like um
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
size of district and things like that
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's got some challenges
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
they would see an increase
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
in their grant level
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
other communities so would clermont
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
where i i went to high school at stevens
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
many many years ago
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
other communities
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
would not see an increase in their grant
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll get to that there is
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
protection in this 10-year plan
 
01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
for those communities but basically when
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
you take section five
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
from line eight on page five
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
all the way down through
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
to the on page six to section six
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
it is a simple
 
01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:12.790 align:start position:0%
it is a simple
math

01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
math
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
what's my grant it's your foundation
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
budget minus your minimum local
 
01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
budget minus your minimum local
contribution

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
contribution
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
times your percentages equals your grant
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
who determines it doe does just the same
 
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
way they do now
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
when do they report it
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
similar time frames for reporting how do
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
communities count on it
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
in when they're preparing their budget
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
because it is clearly in the law it is
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
simple math they know what it's going to
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
be under section 4 and section 3.
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that summary of section 5.
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay questions on
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
section 5 represent porter
 
01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i want to make sure i
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
understand this now so currently
 
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
district a is getting a million dollars
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that the end
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
that the grant the opportunity grant
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
here would be more than that at some for
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
some districts
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
and less than that for other
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
so so if it's a district it's getting a
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars now in the future it
 
01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
might get significantly more because of
 
01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
formula used to determine how much it
 
01:15:23.669 --> 01:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
costs to get their kids to the to the
 
01:15:23.679 --> 01:15:24.870 align:start position:0%
costs to get their kids to the to the
goal

01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
goal
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
other districts might get significantly
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
less than what they're getting now
 
01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:29.910 align:start position:0%
less than what they're getting now
because

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
their kids are above the goal already
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
is that what is that how this is
 
01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:35.590 align:start position:0%
is that what is that how this is
essentially

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
is it
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
in a concept
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
it works that way but
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
under the structure of this bill
 
01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
because of section um the upcoming
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
section yeah
 
01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
there is a transition or hold harmless
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
grant right that means if you were a
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
district like let's say for example
 
01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:56.470 align:start position:0%
district like let's say for example
hanover

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
hanover
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
which has
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know is getting the same amount of
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
money per pupil now that claremont gets
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
they would get a lower grant level
 
01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
but it would be they get compensated for
 
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
a period of time by the whole harmless
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
grant that's in there so in the first
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
year of the operation they see zero
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
decrease right in their ground but
 
01:16:18.239 --> 01:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
decrease right in their ground but
eventually

01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
over the course of the 10 years
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
their amount of money coming from the
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
state would be
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
less at the end of 10 years than it is
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
currently in some cases that could be
 
01:16:31.110 --> 01:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
the case but it's important
 
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
representative porter to recognize that
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
there's two things going on here that
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
transition percentage is going from the
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
70 percent area to a hundred
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's going to be communities that
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
would experience in the first year
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
a lower grant but they're held harmless
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
by the old harmless grant by the time
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
they reach the end of the
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
the 10-year phase in
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
they have higher grant levels than what
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
they had in the in the base year okay so
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
so the the communities now that are
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
collecting maybe this is mixing apples
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
and oranges but
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
i kind of how my brain is this morning
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of a fruit salad
 
01:17:12.719 --> 01:17:13.750 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of a fruit salad
um

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
they're making me
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
hungry um
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
so we have some communities in the state
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
who collect we talk about the swept
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
checks i don't know if we're getting it
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
but they collect more swept tax than the
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
state owes them yes
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
and they keep it
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i haven't gotten to the end of the
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
bill yet so maybe the answer will be
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
there under this plan
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
will they be held harmless you
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
foreshadowed uh a subsequent
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
presentation because it is in the bill
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
may i defer on your question until you
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
get there thank you very much for that
 
01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.189 align:start position:0%
get there thank you very much for that
question

01:17:53.189 --> 01:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
so um and
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
looking at the londonderry case um
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
is how is this
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
scheme going to meet constitutionality
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
of of you know providing the amount of
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
money for adequacy to every child this
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
may i answer and because that that will
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
be a question which is going to pile on
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
us i think that that question underlies
 
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
and plagues
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
every discussion of education funding
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
this state has had
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
since 1997.
 
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:28.310 align:start position:0%
since 1997.
i

01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right to ask it and
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
every proposal
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
whether it's a change of the current
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
system or whether it's this more
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what i believe is a
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
fundamentally sound system
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
is going to asset here's what i think
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
satisfies the requirements of all the
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
claremont cases including claremont ii
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
londonderry the king plan case which i
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
presented to the supreme court uh back
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
in 99 uh it satisfies it in my view as
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
one person
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
other lawyers other people may have
 
01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
different views here's why i think it
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
satisfies it
 
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.990 align:start position:0%
satisfies it
the

01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
claremont cases say that the state
 
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.149 align:start position:0%
claremont cases say that the state
legislature

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:19:14.159 --> 01:19:15.270 align:start position:0%
legislature
has

01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
substantial authority
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
to provide a constitutionally adequate
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
public education for every child in the
 
01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.630 align:start position:0%
public education for every child in the
state

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
but they cannot shirk that duty they
 
01:19:30.149 --> 01:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
must take steps to do it
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
is a completely integrated system
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
that establishes a common integrated
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
goal the foundation opportunity budget
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
with a definition of adequacy that is
 
01:19:42.719 --> 01:19:43.590 align:start position:0%
with a definition of adequacy that is
about

01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.030 align:start position:0%
about
outcomes

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
which many cases representative ladd
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
that the court has written
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
talk about that the legislature has
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
broad discretion of doing this
 
01:19:54.239 --> 01:19:55.510 align:start position:0%
broad discretion of doing this
um

01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
in in what happens is the working of the
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
state grant
 
01:20:03.750 --> 01:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
and the minimum local contribution
 
01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.870 align:start position:0%
and the minimum local contribution
together

01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that every community is
 
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:09.350 align:start position:0%
make sure that every community is
required

01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
to put together a system
 
01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
that will achieve that outcome goal
 
01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.030 align:start position:0%
that will achieve that outcome goal
through

01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
at least
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
the combination of their foundation
 
01:20:21.669 --> 01:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity grant and their minimal
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
local contribution
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
there will be some
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
who will argue
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that the minimum local contribution
 
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
that the minimum local contribution
component

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
component
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
 
01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:33.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass
muster

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
muster
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
because it is using
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
a local property tax resource to meet
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.709 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
i and there will be some towns
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
all we're trying to get to is the
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget under this
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
system there will be some towns
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that their property tax base is
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient that they can fund their
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation requirement the minimum
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
local contribution
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
through their local base and they don't
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
need a grant to get there
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
some will argue
 
01:21:09.910 --> 01:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
that that's using local property taxes
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
to fund public education
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
this court has never been presented
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
with a plan that is so integrated
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
that is so well balanced to focus on
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
one key definition for every community
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
and the court this court has said
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
is never said
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
that you can't have
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
local property taxes used to fund public
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
education never
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
has said that it's never said
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the local government units that
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
local control mean nothing anymore they
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
said the opposite
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
balances the need for
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
continue i believe
 
01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.390 align:start position:0%
continue i believe
local

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
investment of local communities through
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
local government is one of the driving
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that new hampshire
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
produces high quality outcomes from its
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
current common public school system and
 
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
this bill preserves it and i think if we
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
make the right case
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court they will focus on
 
01:22:12.310 --> 01:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
the language that they've said where the
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislature is the leader in terms of
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
determining the policy here and they
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
will ultimately
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
support this kind of integrated proposal
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
in contrast i don't the court's going to
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
be hard-pressed
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
to support something on the current cost
 
01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
to support something on the current cost
system

01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
where you know someone says it's three
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred nine dollars per
 
01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.830 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred nine dollars per
pupil

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
and everywhere in hanover as in
 
01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
and everywhere in hanover as in
claremont

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
i think the court sees that as being
 
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
less reasonable less rational and but
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
that's a case that's pending right now
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
that's in trial that's the conval case
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
but on this bill representative ad
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
i think that this could withstand muster
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
because it's an integrated plan to hit a
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget through a
 
01:23:00.790 --> 01:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
partnership of local uh appropriation
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
and state appropriation thank you
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
were you going to say something then i
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
know that represent porter has a comment
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
or a question i always welcome
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative porter's questions
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be sorry representative that you
 
01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
said that um
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
i i might be jumping ahead again
 
01:23:27.990 --> 01:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
if a community wants to spend more
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
they can raise their taxes to do so i
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
mean if if this says we need
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
you guys need a million dollars to run
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
your schools and they say no we want a
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
million five we can raise our taxes to
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely i'll respond
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
okay it's in it's in the bill
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
okay and and is there is there not a
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
clause in the in the constitution
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
um that requires that it be
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
what we give to it has to be equal
 
01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:58.390 align:start position:0%
what we give to it has to be equal
across

01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.270 --> 01:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
i my understanding was
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
at one point
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the reason that the formula came up
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
that we have now came up was because
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
every child
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
has to get the same
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
has to be equal for every child i think
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's uh different that the equality
 
01:24:21.669 --> 01:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
relates to the opportunity
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be educated to have a
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
good education or the phrase used in new
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire is an adequate education
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
and uh what what it takes to provide
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
that is a different question and this
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill as you've heard
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh looks very closely at a bunch of
 
01:24:40.870 --> 01:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
variables and
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
comes down on the
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
place where it's different from district
 
01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to uh just say
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
support what
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
bill artinger said in terms of
 
01:24:59.199 --> 01:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
bill artinger said in terms of
constitutionality

01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionality
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire supreme court has
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
never been presented
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
with a situation
 
01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
with a situation
where

01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
where
the

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
irregularity the
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
high variability
 
01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.149 align:start position:0%
high variability
of

01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:16.159 --> 01:25:17.430 align:start position:0%
of
local

01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
tax rates
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
as it related to
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
funding of schools
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
had some rationality to it
 
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
this bill tries to put it all together
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
us when we're talking about that
 
01:25:34.149 --> 01:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
adequate education level
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
in a rational way
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
using waiting and so forth
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
and then gets to a funding
 
01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
formula that also
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
um is a sensible reasonable way of
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
of putting this together so
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
the the entirety of the bill
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
is what this the court will look at in
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
the context
 
01:25:59.910 --> 01:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
that the court that the bill seeks to
 
01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:00.950 align:start position:0%
that the court that the bill seeks to
create

01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
create
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
and i think there's a very good chance
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
a a high probability that it will be
 
01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.830 align:start position:0%
a a high probability that it will be
supported

01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
supported
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
they have used the court has used
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
language in the past
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
that gives one pause if you look at the
 
01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
that gives one pause if you look at the
language

01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
in those cases but those cases had a
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
context that was very different from the
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
one that we will be presenting so
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
i've come down i've thought long and
 
01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
hard about this as we've sat through
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
endless along with you
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
representative led
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
endless commission meetings
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i've learned a lot uh it's been a a
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
good experience
 
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
um and it's enormously complicated
 
01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh but i think uh
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
the court too will learn and and and uh
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
and support this if this is where we
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
come out
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much i'd
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
like to move ahead if we can
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
um we're we're just getting a lot of
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
this bill here and there's a lot of
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
discussion that we will have i'm sure
 
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.390 align:start position:0%
discussion that we will have i'm sure
that's

01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we don't have a lot of
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
time but so that we got to keep moving
 
01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
time but so that we got to keep moving
here

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
so can you walk us through some of the
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
additional points absolutely let me just
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
tell you where we're say we're remarking
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
where we're at right now we have gone
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
through the heaviest part of
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
of this of this bill and i think we can
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
start to pick up some speed as we go
 
01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
through the remaining side i'm sure
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
people would love to talk about swept so
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
well we're going to be getting into that
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
very shortly but but let me just hand it
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
back over to bill to uh to take us
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
through um uh section six sec i'm sorry
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
section six on page six
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh which um which i think he's spoken to
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of it right now i'm not going to
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
drag it out representative because we
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
the minimum local contribution part
 
01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:52.639 align:start position:0%
and we're going to talk about
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
representative porter's question about
 
01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
swept comes up just a moment
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
the piece in section 6 that i'd like to
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
focus on additionally is on page 7
 
01:28:03.679 --> 01:28:04.790 align:start position:0%
focus on additionally is on page 7
at

01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
line 4
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
through line 32.
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
this is the transition grant
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
component so
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you are a community
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
where it has your sees your foundation
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity grant
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
being less
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
than a base year which in this bill is
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 but in an amendment
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
that is being prepared by representative
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
luno and team
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
it may be a different year and i think
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
you should confirm that
 
01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh that what will happen is
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
in the first year you get a hundred
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
percent of the difference
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
and then that phase is down in other
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
words it's saying to the local school
 
01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.350 align:start position:0%
words it's saying to the local school
district

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:49.590 align:start position:0%
you know
we're

01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
for example i'm not don't want to pick
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
on hanover but it's right near claremont
 
01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
we used to play on basketball and stuff
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
like that so it you know in that case
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
says to hanover
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to focus our priority a
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
on districts that have greater need
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
to achieve and close that opportunity
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
gap because children and this is mel
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
miller's representative milor's thing
 
01:29:13.669 --> 01:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
children in claremont even if i live in
 
01:29:13.679 --> 01:29:15.030 align:start position:0%
children in claremont even if i live in
concord

01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
concord
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
are my children when i'm in new
 
01:29:16.719 --> 01:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
are my children when i'm in new
hampshire

01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so we're going to focus on claremont
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
but in the first year
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
don't worry we'll hold you harmless in
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and and i just wanted to say
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
that phases out over about a five-year
 
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:30.950 align:start position:0%
that phases out over about a five-year
period

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
period
 
01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
and the goal representative porter as i
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned is by the end of
 
01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
these two phases
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
phase in of the
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget to 100
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
phase out of the hardship grant the goal
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
is to get the number of school districts
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
that are receiving lower grants
 
01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.400 align:start position:0%
down to a manageable level
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
doe is doing the real good data work
 
01:29:56.950 --> 01:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
right now we'll be able to i think
 
01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
determine from their work what that is
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
so uh i guess the question i would have
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
on the whole thing in this transition
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
where are you coming up with the funds
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
to support this transition i see in the
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
bottom here arp and some of the other
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
stuff but i'd like to have us a little
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of discussion on that
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
i'll start it but then let the other um
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
we have seen uh
 
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
we have seen uh
other

01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
there's let's take it your answer
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
provide the answer in two parts
 
01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.709 align:start position:0%
provide the answer in two parts
representative

01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
one part is the core of the foundation
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity plan
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
ends up spending
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
the same amount of state dollars
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
as this state currently has
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
in its education trust fund it's being
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
spent out of state property tax dollars
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2030 so the goal is to
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
fund the shift to foundation opportunity
 
01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.550 align:start position:0%
fund the shift to foundation opportunity
budgets

01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
with the same amount of dollars that are
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the current governmental plan are you
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
including the excess no uh
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
from the statewide education
 
01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
the second part of the
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
plan is how do you fund these hardship
 
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.189 align:start position:0%
plan is how do you fund these hardship
grants

01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
in other states
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
they have taken like massachusetts they
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
have taken the opportunity
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
to make equity changes in their public
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
school funding system
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and they have funded transitions to that
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
using federal arpa dollars and other
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
federal grant dollars
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplates
 
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.270 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplates
using

01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
using
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
available federal i was on gopher
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
and so i worked very closely on that
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
process i've continued to work with the
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
current gopher
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh in bfa
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
on other programs
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
so i know that these dollars exist
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the goal would be to
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
have this legislature
 
01:31:56.239 --> 01:31:57.590 align:start position:0%
have this legislature
consider

01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:58.390 align:start position:0%
consider
this

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
part of this bill to be an important
 
01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.430 align:start position:0%
part of this bill to be an important
priority

01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
priority
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
to protect communities from shocks in
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
and to take steps to allocate some of
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to fund this uh
 
01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.669 align:start position:0%
those federal dollars to fund this uh
relief

01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
has there been any discussion with
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
folks that are have the arpa and the
 
01:32:19.510 --> 01:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
cares act funds has there been any kind
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
of discussion with these people to
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
determine whether there's a an
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
acceptance that
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see a whole harmless
 
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.149 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see a whole harmless
become

01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:32:30.159 --> 01:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
become
stabilization

01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
very very fair i'm going to answer and
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to be quiet for the
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
representatives who are currently
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
elected but i'll say
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
there has not been um that kind of
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
discussion largely because i feel
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
my own personal feeling is it's
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
presumptuous this committee starts first
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
in this process and you've started a
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
process of study
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
but your concern is of how to fund stuff
 
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:56.629 align:start position:0%
but your concern is of how to fund stuff
is

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
a very valid concern
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you right but i think and i think
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question rick on on
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
this nobody wants to see
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh these transition grants turn into
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization and one of the very
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
important things about
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
about the design of
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the foundation opportunity plan is
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
that it does not rely on on 157 million
 
01:33:21.030 --> 01:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
dollars of stabilization to shore up
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
a formula that doesn't work for many
 
01:33:25.110 --> 01:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
many many school districts across the
 
01:33:25.120 --> 01:33:26.470 align:start position:0%
many many school districts across the
state

01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:33:28.470 --> 01:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
what we'll see
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
next week and be able to explore is
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
really how this does work for for school
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
districts financially uh across the
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
state and how it works without the need
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
of um of 157 million dollars of
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
stabilization that's plugged in and
 
01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
static and hasn't moved
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know since it was uh since it was
 
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
put in in
 
01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:51.189 align:start position:0%
put in in
2012

01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
2012
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
something like that well there was a
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
small hold harmless even back in 2008
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
but that was much more than 24 or 25
 
01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:58.390 align:start position:0%
but that was much more than 24 or 25
million

01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so so um so
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
really important to look at the fact
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
that that that this transition grant is
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's a five-year
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
five-year transition it is it is fixed
 
01:34:16.229 --> 01:34:16.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of what its costs
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
um are
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and so it it can be identified
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
prior to the plan going in place in
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
terms of where the source of funds um
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh would be uh could certainly come out
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
of other resources too but uh but the
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
way the bill the what what we're
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
envisioning is uh is that this would be
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
a very appropriate use of um of of
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
federal uh arpa dollars in order to help
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh help us transition into a program
 
01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
like this all right do you
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
are we gonna in future
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
meetings we have here we have just a
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
couple more of them
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
are you gonna have a spreadsheet where
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
we could actually see for example are we
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
talking 157 million dollars
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh are we talking to
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
make the transition work or
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
what how much are you looking for it's
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's more like 250 million
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
dollars in that in that ballpark but
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's total
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's total over over the five years
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay so it's spread out over five so it
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
would be more in the first year less
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
than the second year
 
01:35:23.350 --> 01:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
tapering down
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
so and at the bottom line is 200
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 250 million dollars
 
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
approximately 250 million dollars
okay

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
let's keep marching yeah yeah so um so i
 
01:35:35.590 --> 01:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
think we're on to to section we've we've
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
now covered
 
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
now covered
the

01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just sort of reviewing the bidding
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
here we've covered the definition of
 
01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239 align:start position:0%
adequacy we've covered costing and we've
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
covered funding um now we're taking
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
taking a look at some of the i don't
 
01:35:50.149 --> 01:35:50.159 align:start position:0%
want to call them edge cases because
 
01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
they're all over the state but uh but
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts and there's
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
nobody better than representative ames
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
since he represents towns that are in
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
cooperative school districts to talk us
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
talk through
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
three i've got three cooperative school
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
districts so just a small number
 
01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:11.510 align:start position:0%
districts so just a small number
uh

01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is just a little
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
detour that we don't need to spend any
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
time on
 
01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
it's to ensure that the uh
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding that
 
01:36:25.990 --> 01:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
is is calculated for a municipality
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
following the formula that ms dartinger
 
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
just laid out
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
where there's a minimum local
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
contribution and
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
a grant all based on characteristics of
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
is not that that those
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
conclusions those amounts are not then
 
01:36:46.639 --> 01:36:48.790 align:start position:0%
conclusions those amounts are not then
reapportioned

01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
reapportioned
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
based on a cooperative school formula so
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
what will be a portion continue to be a
 
01:36:58.229 --> 01:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
portion is any spending in that school
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
district above
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
the adequacy level
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
that will be subject to the usual
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
cooperative school apportionment
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
formulas but
 
01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:10.639 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
adequacy grants we wanted to be sure
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
that they stay intact and and what they
 
01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
should be for each each municipality i
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
believe this language does that we can
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds i suppose and try to
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's the case but uh we
 
01:37:32.950 --> 01:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted no reapportionment
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
of the grants going to uh
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
that have been determined under this
 
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.070 align:start position:0%
that have been determined under this
bill

01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
01:37:41.679 --> 01:37:42.390 align:start position:0%
represent porter
so

01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
again that means that hillsborough
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
deering is going to be one figure for
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
the deering kids and one figure for the
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
hillsborough kids
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
and they so
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the budget will be
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
the grant will be
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
it won't be
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
all those kids smooshed together and one
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
figure for them okay just wanted to make
 
01:38:04.149 --> 01:38:04.159 align:start position:0%
sure it will be one grant for a deer and
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
one grant for hillsboro okay thank you
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um linda's gotta
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah go ahead just uh
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
to expand it a little bit further
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
i represent part of the kearsarge
 
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.030 align:start position:0%
i represent part of the kearsarge
district

01:38:19.030 --> 01:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
eight schools
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
eight towns um
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
each town would then have its own uh
 
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
could you explain that to me how that
 
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
works i see it with hillsboro during the
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
and the budget in most cases will
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
continue to be above what we're talking
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
about here
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh and it then it subtracts out federal
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
money that it may receive
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
and special grants that it may receive
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
like the uh
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
we talked about special education the
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
what uh that the special grant straight
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:39:03.199 --> 01:39:04.149 align:start position:0%
from the state
um

01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
that goes to the school district
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
now it's at a point
 
01:39:11.189 --> 01:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
um will then be
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
um apportioned according to the school
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
formula you've got eight
 
01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities i'm sure there's lots of
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's quite a range of percentages
 
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
and now you've got
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
an apportion value that goes to
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
to each of those
 
01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.109 align:start position:0%
to each of those
municipalities

01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
deducted from that
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
will be the
 
01:39:40.629 --> 01:39:40.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant
 
01:39:40.639 --> 01:39:41.750 align:start position:0%
adequacy grant
that's

01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:43.590 align:start position:0%
that's
uh

01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
that is has been figured under this bill
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
for that municipality
 
01:39:51.109 --> 01:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then the municipality
 
01:39:51.119 --> 01:39:52.830 align:start position:0%
and then the municipality
uh

01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:57.910 --> 01:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
will um contribute the five dollars plus
 
01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.870 align:start position:0%
will um contribute the five dollars plus
whatever

01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
extra is needed to meet that apportioned
 
01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.310 align:start position:0%
extra is needed to meet that apportioned
um

01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
at a portioned amount
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's been a long time since i've really
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
delved into the cooperative school
 
01:40:11.199 --> 01:40:12.229 align:start position:0%
delved into the cooperative school
district

01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
budget but it seemed to me it was
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
the apportionment was based on
 
01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.910 align:start position:0%
the apportionment was based on
adm

01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
adm
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
and part of it on that and part of it on
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
the tax base of the town
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure how that splits up when
 
01:40:27.510 --> 01:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
when you're counting adm
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
in the foundation grant as well um
 
01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
we're trying not to mix the two okay
 
01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.790 align:start position:0%
we're trying not to mix the two okay
yeah

01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
okay we can go through that in detail
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
we'll see if this this is part of the
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
bill that the uh
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
the ols will be uh giving us numbers on
 
01:40:47.669 --> 01:40:47.679 align:start position:0%
not only oh that's the other one
 
01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
lba sorry
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be giving us numbers on so
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
we'll see whether we've done it right or
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
or not uh the goal is to not
 
01:40:59.350 --> 01:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
not have what's done here
 
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
refigured through a cooperative abortion
 
01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:03.590 align:start position:0%
refigured through a cooperative abortion
or

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.270 align:start position:0%
or
process

01:41:07.270 --> 01:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
those agreements in these cooperative
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
districts between the districts
 
01:41:14.070 --> 01:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
and how they proportion or apportion the
 
01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.189 align:start position:0%
and how they proportion or apportion the
dollars

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:41:15.199 --> 01:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
dollars
uh

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:41:18.310 --> 01:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
well just like uh
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
no we're going to try to maintain the
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
integrity of this system
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
and respect the apportionment formulas
 
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
as they apply to
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
funds that need to be properly
 
01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:29.189 align:start position:0%
funds that need to be properly
apportioned

01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
apportioned
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
for each
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
district well
 
01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
district well
representative

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh mr chair so
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
let me just
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
strip this down if you will
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative so these amounts the that
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
communities will be receiving
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
under this plan they're going to those
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
amounts are going to be determined by
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
real life kids with real live needs not
 
01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.070 align:start position:0%
real life kids with real live needs not
just

01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not the kid exists but
 
01:42:00.790 --> 01:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not they have english learner
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
needs special education needs poverty
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
needs right
 
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.830 align:start position:0%
needs right
so

01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the cooperative districts or in all
 
01:42:10.470 --> 01:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
districts for that matter
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
the the money that's coming in is going
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
to be determined by how much of that
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be offset
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
the the ell needs the special ed needs
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
right because
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
communities with higher numbers will
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
have higher needs
 
01:42:29.189 --> 01:42:29.199 align:start position:0%
am i correct in in boiling it down to
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
that and the grant money will reflect
 
01:42:33.669 --> 01:42:33.679 align:start position:0%
those needs right yeah
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
based upon the sending or the
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
participant district or the
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
i guess i i i
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
so yeah yeah so i got that i guess i
 
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
need to see a speech so just like what
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
the doe does right now where they where
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
they provide the adequacy grant on a on
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
a municipal
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
level even if you're a member of a of a
 
01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:02.310 align:start position:0%
level even if you're a member of a of a
co-op

01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
co-op
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
the number of students let's say in
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
hillsboro and the number of students
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
endearing and each will get a
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
get a get a grant calculation from from
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
hillsborough will have a foundation
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget as calculated in
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
sections three and four on this deering
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
will get a foundation opportunity budget
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
hill hillsborough deering co-op might
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
have i'm making it up
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know maybe
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
um two-thirds of their budget comes from
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
hillsboro one-third of their budget
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
comes from deering i mean i don't know
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it happens to be but prior to
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
they get to that part
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
deering would contribute its foundation
 
01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget in to the mix
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
hillsboro would put its foundation
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget into the mix remember
 
01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget is
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
made up by the local minimum
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
contribution plus any additional money
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
that comes from the state to get you
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
there and then whatever is left
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
what is short you know what whatever
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
hillsborough deering co-op approves as a
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
budget if it's
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
greater than that then then then those
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
dollars would be subject to the co-op
 
01:44:11.199 --> 01:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
dollars would be subject to the co-op
agreement

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
but but the foundation opportunity
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
budget is calculated the same way
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
that i mean very similar you know
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
according to a formula
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
how um how the cost of inadequate
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
education is calculated today
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
yeah i was
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
going to i was driving towards this cat
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
aid type situation
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
the cat aids paid by the co-op but the
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
cost of that
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
specific shouldn't child or
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
program service shouldn't go back to
 
01:44:41.590 --> 01:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
that sending district should it or or
 
01:44:43.990 --> 01:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
how is that going to be handled
 
01:44:45.189 --> 01:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
yeah that's right special ed aid right
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
right i believe that's done on a
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
lagging by one year okay right it's
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
totally a separate picture and that
 
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
categorical grant is is is taken out of
 
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:04.229 align:start position:0%
categorical grant is is is taken out of
the

01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
the doe 25 costs that are being used
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
so i just don't want to get into this
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
mixing them together here so so um so if
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you would like um mr chair i think we
 
01:45:18.709 --> 01:45:18.719 align:start position:0%
can get through the next um few sections
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
we've come up with this formula for each
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
community based on the needs in the
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
community and we're making sure that
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
when we go
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
to the cooperative school district that
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
each community is still separately
 
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.550 align:start position:0%
each community is still separately
getting

01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
their needs met you know the money for
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then potentially plus whatever else
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
which will be divided according to the
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
thing but my question is we've given
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
this money
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
looked at each individual community and
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
figured out what the needs of that
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
community are but then once all that
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
money goes to the cooperative district
 
01:46:03.189 --> 01:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
how are we making sure that it gets
 
01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:04.310 align:start position:0%
how are we making sure that it gets
spent

01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that's thank you for the the
 
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
question representative leakes i think
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
the important thing to to recognize
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh in section four
 
01:46:20.629 --> 01:46:20.639 align:start position:0%
sections three and section four in
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
building those that foundation
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for every every
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
municipality whether they're whether
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
they run operate their own school
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
district or whether they're uh members
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
of a cooperative or regional
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
school district is that is that that
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget or those
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budgets for in
 
01:46:45.990 --> 01:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
the case of a cooperative or regional um
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
is for the school district to educate
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
all of the students
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
to to that outcome and that's how these
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
have been been calculated
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's how the foundation opportunity
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
budget is calculated so so like we you
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
know talked about earlier different um
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
school different school districts
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
may spend different amounts on on
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
whether it's special education or
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
english language learning or
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
or programs for um
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know for
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
for students across their you know in
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
their in their school district whether
 
01:47:23.750 --> 01:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's extracurricular act or
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
co-curricular activities
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
um advanced placement classes stuff like
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
that um uh they they they have they have
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
discretion to uh to to spend it the way
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
the school board would like and that's
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
part of that that partnership between
 
01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
local between state and local um local
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
governments and we're going to be
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting into the accountability section
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
very very soon
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we had one more question i
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
know this
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
right now all this is we don't target
 
01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:55.350 align:start position:0%
right now all this is we don't target
money

01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:55.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.550 align:start position:0%
money
uh

01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
you receive the pot of money you
 
01:47:59.830 --> 01:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
district use the money
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
but that's always an age-old question
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
accountability but uh representative
 
01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli could i just
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
supplement dave's answer to the and then
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
i'll shut up
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
they're you're asking how do we know
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
that this is being used in a way to
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
achieve these goals
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
one thing we don't do is disrupt local
 
01:48:18.639 --> 01:48:19.669 align:start position:0%
one thing we don't do is disrupt local
government

01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
agreements so the cooperative agreements
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
right now are operating this bill
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't alter those at all
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
but the other thing we know is there's a
 
01:48:27.679 --> 01:48:28.870 align:start position:0%
but the other thing we know is there's a
10-year

01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
10-year
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
at least you know even shorter check
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
on whether the opportunity gaps are
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
being closed or not that's in the
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
accountability section that you'll see
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.830 align:start position:0%
and that is
more

01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh and coordinated
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
checking on whether we're achieving
 
01:48:53.669 --> 01:48:53.679 align:start position:0%
performance goals than any education
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
funding proposal that i've seen yet in
 
01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
the last three decades and one of the
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
things the supreme court
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
mandated in its claremont cases was
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
a system that doesn't have
 
01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:09.189 align:start position:0%
a system that doesn't have
accountability

01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
is not a constitutional system
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
this proposal has greater accountability
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
than anyone i've seen today
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
represent cornelli
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
um just wondering we talked about a
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about co-ops how about
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
districts that tuition their students
 
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
to either another district
 
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
or to a private school
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
how do they how would they fit into this
 
01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh system
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
so thanks for the the question
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli so
 
01:49:43.669 --> 01:49:43.679 align:start position:0%
the same way
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
the same way schools that um the same
 
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.550 align:start position:0%
the same way schools that um the same
way

01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do operate their own
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
their own public schools they'll receive
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
they they'll receive a foundation
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget as calculated by
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
their um
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
by or as uh yeah is calculated by the
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
the um the students that they um they
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
serve and the characteristics of the
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
district that they're in
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
and um and then
 
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.629 align:start position:0%
and um and then
that

01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
any any additional resources that uh
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
that they need over and above that
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity uh budget they
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
would uh raise through local property
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
taxes if it's if the foundation
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget was insufficient
 
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:26.390 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget was insufficient
to

01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:27.430 align:start position:0%
to
to

01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:34.629 --> 01:50:34.639 align:start position:0%
levels that that are required by that
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
district and or required in the tuition
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
agreement and um and then they'd uh
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
they'd proceed um they'd proceed forth
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh with that but uh
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
very much the same as the the way that
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
it happens right now between between the
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
um the minimum local contribution the
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
grant that comes from the state
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
comprising that foundation budget and
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
then any additional
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
costs that that that that that
 
01:51:04.310 --> 01:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
municipality would incur through through
 
01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
municipality would incur through through
tuition

01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
agreements they'd have to make up the
 
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:08.560 align:start position:0%
difference and uh
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
just as they do today
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
you're a follow-up yes thank you um
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
just wondering how that would work
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
though with
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
some of the criteria in the formula such
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
as the size of the school district would
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
that be the size of the school district
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
of the sending
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
district or they might be sending it to
 
01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
a district that's considerably larger
 
01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
would you be factoring in the size of
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
the school that those kids are actually
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
that that that's exactly a
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli you'd factor in
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
the size the characteristics of the
 
01:51:44.229 --> 01:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
district that they're attending or the
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
school that they're attending
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
okay that's
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right okay so then
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
then that section should read the
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
size of the school district
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
um that they are
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
of attendance
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
resident so you're talking adm a and
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
admr and that would have to be defined
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
in here correct
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good that's
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
that i think that's a very good good
 
01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:13.589 align:start position:0%
that i think that's a very good good
suggestion

01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
01:52:13.599 --> 01:52:16.470 align:start position:0%
suggestion
yes

01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i i they do that basically
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
now with their tuition agreements i know
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's one
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
school district below me that sends to
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
five different high schools
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
and of all different sizes and costs
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
those adjustments are going to have to
 
01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
be made by that sending
 
01:52:34.639 --> 01:52:37.109 align:start position:0%
be made by that sending
district

01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay let's go on here all right we'll
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
keep going we're at the top of page nine
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
and uh i think we can get through this
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
um um
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
very quickly and and dick do you want to
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
speak to these or i'm happy to to move
 
01:52:49.599 --> 01:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
speak to these or i'm happy to to move
through

01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
so so so a lot of this we've already
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the section 8 actually defines what that
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
minimum foundation budget contribution
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
is for every municipality uh in the
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
state and and as was said earlier
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
it's um it's the lower of five uh
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand uh as a local
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
education property tax or
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
such a lower rate and i'm on line nine
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh on the top of page eight or such
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
lower rate
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
that um that is sufficient to to raise
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
the amount of local funds
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh necessary to um to to reach the um
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget so
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
there will be some municipalities across
 
01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:37.679 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:53:37.679 --> 01:53:39.030 align:start position:0%
the state
that

01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
that will be paying less than five
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
dollars per thousand in order to uh to
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
get to that number section nine
 
01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:47.589 align:start position:0%
get to that number section nine
um

01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:50.790 --> 01:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
of uh let's see section nine here oh
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
basically it's it's sort of it's i would
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
call it housekeeping but it basically
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
adds the transition grants as being a um
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
an expense that can be carried through
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so the
 
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
education trust fund would see you know
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
transfers of at least based on this
 
01:54:12.390 --> 01:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
arpa fund sufficient to
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
to um to meet the needs of the uh
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
or the demands of the transition grants
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
going through the education trust fund
 
01:54:24.149 --> 01:54:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh and now we really get into section 10
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
uh which really begins accountability
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
and i think this goes to what
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
representative porter had um had asked
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
earlier and um
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
and this is this is amended um
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment to existing language so so
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh not all of it only the um only the
 
01:54:45.270 --> 01:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
bold um uh
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
fonts are where changes uh uh
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
are made but you can see as the as as
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
you turn over to page nine
 
01:54:56.149 --> 01:54:56.159 align:start position:0%
and uh and into page ten
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh it actually ends on um on halfway
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
down uh page ten
 
01:55:04.070 --> 01:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
but uh but and i'm not going to get into
 
01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
all of these different uh pieces of data
 
01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
and this doesn't have to be an
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list either uh but these are
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
these are things that
 
01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh that the department would would be
 
01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:16.070 align:start position:0%
uh that the department would would be
collecting

01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh from uh from every um
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
municipal or every school district on
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
the doe 25 and some of these things
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
would be able to be used
 
01:55:28.390 --> 01:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
for measuring um
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
results student performance student
 
01:55:34.149 --> 01:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
outcomes and some of them may be
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
helpful as far as being able to consider
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
other differentiated aid factors
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
you know do we have the right factors
 
01:55:43.189 --> 01:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
between free and reduced price launch
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
english english language learning and
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
special education
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
maybe that's what we use right now but
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
there may be others as well and so uh so
 
01:55:52.629 --> 01:55:52.639 align:start position:0%
these are
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
these would be data that uh that could
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
be uh collected by the department uh and
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh and used both in in in outcome
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
determinations as well as some future
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
funding formulas as um as bill larger
 
01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:09.910 align:start position:0%
funding formulas as um as bill larger
mentioned

01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
the formula would be updated certainly
 
01:56:14.390 --> 01:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
no less frequently than every 10 years
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
and uh and so this would give the the
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
state the opportunity or the department
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh to consider
 
01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.390 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh to consider
information

01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um going into section 11 we really get
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
into the the accountability
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
of you know pieces and you can see on
 
01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:31.510 align:start position:0%
of you know pieces and you can see on
line

01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
34 on page 10 where where we talk about
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
the specific data that
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
that ties into student outcomes
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
performance on statewide assessment
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
tests graduation rates attendance rates
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um and looking at what would be the
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
the lowest performing 20
 
01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
of of schools
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
and um and you know and i think there's
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a lot of work on this
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
i mean this is this is not an area to be
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
taken lightly and it's not something
 
01:57:04.709 --> 01:57:04.719 align:start position:0%
that we that we want to be considered to
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
be punitive or pejorative or you're a
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
bad school district or anything like
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
we want this to be constructive
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
and and really put the state in a
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
position through the department
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
where where we can lend a hand to uh to
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
provide districts that
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
that geez you know we're spending we're
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're using the money where we
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
thought it would be best but it just
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen to be working that way
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
well what can the uh what can the state
 
01:57:38.709 --> 01:57:38.719 align:start position:0%
suggest to do how can you help and
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
that's where um
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
where where you know things begin really
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
taking up
 
01:57:47.589 --> 01:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh on page 11 on line 8 starting in
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
section 12
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
with a local education improvement plan
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
and um and and it's created by the
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
superintendent of uh of these districts
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
but also with the support from the uh
 
01:58:02.070 --> 01:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner
 
01:58:04.550 --> 01:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh to put together a turnaround plan
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
for these these lowest performing 20 of
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
schools so you're constantly you're not
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
saying that these are bad schools but
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
you're constantly um looking for for
 
01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
improvement and um and this is the the
 
01:58:20.950 --> 01:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
the bottom 20 is something that has been
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
um been actually is used in a lot of
 
01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.280 align:start position:0%
businesses uh as well
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
during um uh during during employee
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry employee reviews
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
um so uh so it so it does provide um
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
provide feedback
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
support from from the department
 
01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.149 align:start position:0%
support from from the department
um

01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh again you've got um you know sort of
 
01:58:46.229 --> 01:58:46.239 align:start position:0%
at the middle of of page 11 lines 24
 
01:58:46.239 --> 01:58:47.270 align:start position:0%
at the middle of of page 11 lines 24
through

01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:48.709 align:start position:0%
through
27

01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
27
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
where where you're looking at how
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
budgets are being spent
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that spending is
 
01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:56.709 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that spending is
really

01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
efficient to drive outcomes
 
01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.390 align:start position:0%
efficient to drive outcomes
and

01:59:00.390 --> 01:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the things that's um
 
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
and you know one of the things that's um
that

01:59:03.750 --> 01:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
tends to be true and i think um um mr
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
artinger asked me to comment on it
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
earlier about uh
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
spending efficiency um
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's a there's it wiggles around a
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
little bit and it and it usually ties to
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's pretty tight to the
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
um the the resources that are available
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
in a in a community so in a community
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
that has access to
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
to um to a lot of resources through high
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
property wealth per uh per pupil you may
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually see some less efficient
 
01:59:39.510 --> 01:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
spending than in a district
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
um let's say you know newport which has
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of the highest um
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
local education tax rates in the state
 
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh they're looking to spend that money
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as possible so um so
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
being having the state come in and being
 
01:59:56.830 --> 01:59:56.840 align:start position:0%
able to help um
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
administrations uh help school
 
02:00:02.149 --> 02:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
administrators identify um uh spending
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency is uh is part of those
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
turnaround plans
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh let's see we're going on to 12 and
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to get page 12 and we're
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to get into
 
02:00:16.020 --> 02:00:16.030 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.030 --> 02:00:17.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:00:17.589 --> 02:00:17.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
wrap up the accountability section
 
02:00:20.239 --> 02:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
wrap up the accountability section
um

02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:29.350 --> 02:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know i think at the top of page 12
 
02:00:34.149 --> 02:00:34.159 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about sort of um a
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
deeper analysis on
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
on on student outcomes uh what sort of
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
things can what additional factors could
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
be considered in terms of student
 
02:00:47.109 --> 02:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
outcomes safety and disa safety and
 
02:00:47.119 --> 02:00:48.629 align:start position:0%
outcomes safety and disa safety and
discipline

02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
discipline
 
02:00:51.589 --> 02:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
again achievement on on tests
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
college readiness so looking at like
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
line 10
 
02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.510 align:start position:0%
line 10
and

02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
some of the things that i think
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
represented porter was talking about
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then beginning on line 14
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
we go into section 13
 
02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
where um where and this is a very uh you
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
know interesting this is a new a new
 
02:01:13.599 --> 02:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
know interesting this is a new a new
area

02:01:14.470 --> 02:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:15.669 align:start position:0%
area
um

02:01:15.669 --> 02:01:15.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
where uh where we talk about um
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
persistent disparities and uh where
 
02:01:24.070 --> 02:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
where certain subgroups and again these
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
subgroups could be identified through
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
data collection that's currently
 
02:01:30.229 --> 02:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
happening or through the the new data
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
collection that's part of this this
 
02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
accountability section
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
and uh how are subgroups uh performing
 
02:01:40.470 --> 02:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of outcomes and um and how can
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
through a
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
a um requesting a three-year plan from
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
local administrators um help uh help to
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
improve and that's where
 
02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
improve and that's where
for

02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
results for for students in these
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
subgroups and that's really what you see
 
02:01:58.470 --> 02:01:58.480 align:start position:0%
on the bottom of page 12 beginning in
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
romans 3 and there's a few things
 
02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:02.390 align:start position:0%
romans 3 and there's a few things
suggested

02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh here um
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
the the budget evidence-based program
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that trying to move us
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
quickly through through this
 
02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:14.390 align:start position:0%
quickly through through this
um

02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
on now on page 13 line 13
 
02:02:22.390 --> 02:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
identification of outcome metrics um
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh that are being used by the by the
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
district and um
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and then line 20 uh how will
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
the district um helped to improve parent
 
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
engagement in uh in their students
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
learning so uh so these are things that
 
02:02:40.070 --> 02:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
are that are really long term
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
um it's it's
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
particularly in the in the persistent um
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh category of persistent disparities
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and they may not be able to be you you
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
may not be able to measure differences
 
02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
in in any given month or in any given
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
year but uh but hopefully uh seeing
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
those those disparities um
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
taper down or or close those gaps um as
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
um you know over the long term based on
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
based on the um
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
the plants uh jointly put together by
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
the the local administrators and the uh
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
the department so that brings us to the
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
page of uh the top of page 14
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
and uh and we really swing um now into
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
into revenue policy and i
 
02:03:33.430 --> 02:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
would uh would love to turn it back over
 
02:03:36.629 --> 02:03:36.639 align:start position:0%
to uh to um to mr artinger and
 
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative ames to drive us through
 
02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:40.830 align:start position:0%
representative ames to drive us through
this

02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so we're looking at uh section
 
02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:45.510 align:start position:0%
yeah uh so we're looking at uh section
14

02:03:45.510 --> 02:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
14
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
on page 14 and then
 
02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:49.510 align:start position:0%
on page 14 and then
um

02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
skipping a few
 
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:52.709 align:start position:0%
skipping a few
uh

02:03:52.709 --> 02:03:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
taking up again at section 18 on page 16
 
02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
through 23 and these all have to do with
 
02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:02.800 align:start position:0%
the statewide education property tax
 
02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:04.709 align:start position:0%
the statewide education property tax
and

02:04:04.709 --> 02:04:04.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
we start with the section 14 where we're
 
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
we start with the section 14 where we're
simply

02:04:09.510 --> 02:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
reaffirming that we're staying at the
 
02:04:14.870 --> 02:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
same level that we
 
02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:15.830 align:start position:0%
same level that we
will

02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:04:18.550 --> 02:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
have been at we we will
 
02:04:21.270 --> 02:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
be at the 363 million dollar level
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
according to this there's just no
 
02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to change
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh the level and that's what the
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
education tax will revert to after
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 which as you know is down
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.229 --> 02:04:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's all that section 14 does and then
 
02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
in sections the other sections
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
i did
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
provide you with a one-pager for these
 
02:04:48.790 --> 02:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
tax sections the reason that was easy
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
for me to do
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
these sections are also exactly the same
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
as the sections that are in
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
house bill 504
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that weighs a means
 
02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:02.950 align:start position:0%
which is a bill that weighs a means
handled

02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
handled
 
02:05:04.790 --> 02:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
and which has been
 
02:05:08.149 --> 02:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
um sent to interim study by vote of the
 
02:05:10.390 --> 02:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
house in january
 
02:05:10.400 --> 02:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
house in january
so

02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
we've simply
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
put those sections into this bill
 
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
because we think they're an integral
 
02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
because we think they're an integral
part

02:05:17.589 --> 02:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
and very important to this bill with
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
respect to the property tax
 
02:05:24.950 --> 02:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
there is a key provision
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
in 504 and in this bill
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
that mr hartinger will speak to and that
 
02:05:32.719 --> 02:05:34.310 align:start position:0%
that mr hartinger will speak to and that
is

02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
relates to what we all call
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you in this bill
 
02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:44.310 align:start position:0%
thank you in this bill
uh

02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:47.109 --> 02:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
under current law
 
02:05:49.350 --> 02:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that every
 
02:05:49.360 --> 02:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that every
community

02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:05:54.069 --> 02:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
pay statewide property tax at a rate
 
02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
that's established sufficient to get to
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
the 363
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
million dollar target
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
it's 263 for one of the years and now
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
and then it goes back to 363.
 
02:06:06.159 --> 02:06:07.109 align:start position:0%
and then it goes back to 363.
they

02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:06:07.119 --> 02:06:07.830 align:start position:0%
they
they

02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
for some communities
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
that rate
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
is not fully enforced in 2011
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to our state
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
revenue statutes that said
 
02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
whereas before
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
all communities had to calculate their
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
state property tax and to the extent
 
02:06:29.679 --> 02:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
state property tax and to the extent
they

02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
were able to use it to meet their
 
02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant
 
02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:35.589 align:start position:0%
adequate education grant
target

02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
target
 
02:06:37.510 --> 02:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
they would keep it all
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
but some communities raised so much
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
money that it was far above their
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
adequate education number and what the
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
prior to 2011 they had to take that
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
excess and pay it to the state treasurer
 
02:06:52.149 --> 02:06:52.159 align:start position:0%
so their taxpayers were paying at the
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
same rate
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that every other taxpayer in the state
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
was in 2011 that was changed
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
so no longer did a community which had
 
02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
excess state property tax were they
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
required to pay it to the state
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
and what we heard in the commission is
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
are really using that money
 
02:07:16.390 --> 02:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
to reduce
 
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
the tax rates in those communities
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
meaning that some taxpayers
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
in in property wealthy communities are
 
02:07:25.350 --> 02:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
paying a lower rate
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
for a state tax than other taxpayers
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
i in connection with house bill 504
 
02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
i wrote a letter
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
to representative norm major the chair
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
of the house ways and means committee
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
this letter is provided to you on your
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
work in your group work group
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
and what it says
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:07:48.470 --> 02:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
we may not be facing a current lawsuit
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
here yet
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
but this is a big risk and we're talking
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
about literally
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars every
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
year that are potentially being
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
collected through an unconstitutional
 
02:08:02.239 --> 02:08:03.510 align:start position:0%
collected through an unconstitutional
tax

02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:08:05.430 --> 02:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
that should be something that the state
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire cares about when it's
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
preparing its offering statements
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
and and dealing with potential
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
litigation risks
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill does
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
is following up with the commission
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
is say we're not going to take that risk
 
02:08:22.550 --> 02:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
anymore we're going to correct it and so
 
02:08:24.629 --> 02:08:24.639 align:start position:0%
every taxpayer
 
02:08:26.149 --> 02:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:08:28.310 --> 02:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
would be required to pay the state
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
property tax rate collected by their
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
local community
 
02:08:35.350 --> 02:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
but the local community administration
 
02:08:37.430 --> 02:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
would then turn those amounts
 
02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
over to the state treasurer
 
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
minus cost of administration
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
and what that is designed to do
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
is number one
 
02:08:46.239 --> 02:08:47.589 align:start position:0%
is number one
eliminate

02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
this constitutional
 
02:08:49.679 --> 02:08:50.629 align:start position:0%
this constitutional
threat

02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
threat
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
to the finances of the state of new
 
02:08:54.550 --> 02:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire and that's in this bill it's
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
very very important to
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
in my view
 
02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
just to finish this part of it uh
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
the other changes that are in the bill
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
that relate to uh
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
to the statewide education property tax
 
02:09:15.119 --> 02:09:15.990 align:start position:0%
to the statewide education property tax
uh

02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
go at uh amend the low and moderate
 
02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:20.790 align:start position:0%
go at uh amend the low and moderate
income

02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:09:23.589 --> 02:09:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh relief program property tax relief
 
02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
program that's uh
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
that is an
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
integral part of the swept system
 
02:09:34.229 --> 02:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.239 --> 02:09:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
to

02:09:35.189 --> 02:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
say it
 
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
and in shorthand
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
it uh it provides
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
more relief
 
02:09:43.199 --> 02:09:44.790 align:start position:0%
more relief
and

02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
higher eligible
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
and more people will be eligible
 
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:50.629 align:start position:0%
and more people will be eligible
and

02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
it also extends that relief to the
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
local property tax as well as the
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
statewide property tax so
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
it adds those two together
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
and then the relief is calculated
 
02:10:03.199 --> 02:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
and then the relief is calculated
against

02:10:04.470 --> 02:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
against
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the bill is that's come to the
 
02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.750 align:start position:0%
whatever the bill is that's come to the
particular

02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
property tax payer
 
02:10:11.119 --> 02:10:11.910 align:start position:0%
property tax payer
and

02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
that means a larger sum a larger amount
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
of relief can be granted
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
the bill includes a cap on the total
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
amount that
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
of relief that will be available i
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
believe it's 25 million dollars
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
and that would be come out of the excess
 
02:10:31.669 --> 02:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
swept of the money that
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
has come into the state treasury as a
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
result of this tax
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh so i think that's the gist of the uh
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
statewide education property tax
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
provisions and if i i might add one
 
02:10:48.069 --> 02:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
thing to this so
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
there's been an issue over the last
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
decades in school funding about donor
 
02:10:52.639 --> 02:10:53.589 align:start position:0%
decades in school funding about donor
towns

02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
towns
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
donor towns
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
donor towns
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is what we've been talking about is
 
02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
the solution to the donor town problem
 
02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
i remember asking someone from a donor
 
02:11:07.109 --> 02:11:07.119 align:start position:0%
town in the administration of their
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
donor of their their government do you
 
02:11:12.629 --> 02:11:12.639 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:11:12.639 --> 02:11:13.510 align:start position:0%
the town
pay

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
property tax do you pay property tax
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
the answer of course is no no town or
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
city pays property tax who pays it
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay individual taxpayers
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the solution that representative ames
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
has identified has an elegance to it in
 
02:11:35.669 --> 02:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
my view which is
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
we're not going to provide tax relief
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
to an entire city and town which is then
 
02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:43.669 align:start position:0%
to an entire city and town which is then
distributed

02:11:43.669 --> 02:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
to taxpayers who may need the
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
benefit and taxpayers who don't
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do instead is
 
02:11:53.270 --> 02:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
refocus that
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
to provide targeted relief for taxpayers
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
who have the greatest need those are low
 
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
and moderate income
 
02:12:04.629 --> 02:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
property tax owners and so
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
when the donor towns come and say hey
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
under this plan which may have a
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
constitutionally positive thing about it
 
02:12:17.189 --> 02:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to be a donor town again
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
remember they don't pay taxes their
 
02:12:22.550 --> 02:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers do and this bill
 
02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:23.990 align:start position:0%
taxpayers do and this bill
provides

02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
provides
 
02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
the most robust
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
property tax relief
 
02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
 
02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:31.030 align:start position:0%
that i've seen
in

02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:12:32.390 --> 02:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
and i've been a tax lawyer in new
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire i served on the ways and means
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
committee when i was 19 years old that
 
02:12:39.109 --> 02:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
that in in that whole time this is real
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
property tax relief but it's not given
 
02:12:43.350 --> 02:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
to towns
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
or cities
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
and all indiscriminately taller tax
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
rates it's given into targeted
 
02:12:51.030 --> 02:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayers with low and
 
02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.709 --> 02:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
griffs and boom
 
02:12:57.669 --> 02:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:13:00.229 --> 02:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i've always said in my town i mean
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's not a statewide property tax it's
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
the local property taxes it never leaves
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
the town
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and i agree with you i think this maybe
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
hey maybe should be a separate bill i
 
02:13:10.719 --> 02:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
hey maybe should be a separate bill i
mean

02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
it's been there
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it should be i mean yeah 504
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
is it yeah because it it's not a
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
statewide property tax if it doesn't
 
02:13:25.750 --> 02:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
leave your town i mean come on
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
i mean that's why i said let's do away
 
02:13:30.390 --> 02:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
with it because it doesn't help in my
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
town it just it's your property tax the
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
two together
 
02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
two together
so

02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
hey let's use it as a statewide property
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
tax because we know there are some towns
 
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
that don't have schools and
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
and they're keeping the money i mean it
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
should go to the state
 
02:13:47.030 --> 02:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
has a statewide property taxes just one
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
might comment thank you rep santana
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
yes this is an area probably i get
 
02:13:55.030 --> 02:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
hammered from uh because of sunapee in
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
my district
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
the one of the arguments with sunapee is
 
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously other towns that are in
 
02:14:04.950 --> 02:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
the same category of centipede
 
02:14:07.910 --> 02:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
is that yes we have a grand list that's
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know very large but at the same time
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
within that town
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
we have a certain number of property
 
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:16.229 align:start position:0%
we have a certain number of property
owners

02:14:16.229 --> 02:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
owners
 
02:14:16.239 --> 02:14:17.109 align:start position:0%
owners
who

02:14:17.109 --> 02:14:17.119 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
have low incomes or fixed incomes
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
and do not it's not reflected in you
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
know our taxes because the property is
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
valued assessed so high
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh in our area and it's gone out of
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
sight in the last
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
two years with uh covid
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
our assessments have you know
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
really gone crazy
 
02:14:42.629 --> 02:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
so how do i go back
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
to that town
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and explain to them
 
02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
and explain to them
uh

02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:48.950 --> 02:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
what this all means
 
02:14:50.229 --> 02:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
and why they shouldn't consider
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
themselves a donor town
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then i would say that um there are
 
02:14:59.840 --> 02:15:01.430 align:start position:0%
and then i would say that um there are
two

02:15:01.430 --> 02:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
points that need to be made one is the
 
02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
points that need to be made one is the
law

02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:05.589 align:start position:0%
law
that

02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:07.750 --> 02:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
from a constitutional point of view this
 
02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
from a constitutional point of view this
is

02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
a statewide tax it's collected with the
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
help of the local
 
02:15:16.229 --> 02:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
assessors and so forth
 
02:15:16.239 --> 02:15:17.669 align:start position:0%
assessors and so forth
but

02:15:17.669 --> 02:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is a statewide tax and all state wide
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
taxes get paid into the state treasury
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
and then paid out and that's how this
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is
 
02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.030 align:start position:0%
and the second thing is
that

02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
is the property tax relief part of this
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
and this enables for the people in your
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
district in santa fe
 
02:15:39.599 --> 02:15:40.950 align:start position:0%
district in santa fe
that

02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
are hurting because of the tax levels
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
um even though
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
on the whole sanofi looks like a wealthy
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
district i'm sure there are people in
 
02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:50.629 align:start position:0%
district i'm sure there are people in
there

02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:15:50.639 --> 02:15:51.430 align:start position:0%
there
who

02:15:51.430 --> 02:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:53.270 align:start position:0%
who
are

02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
either because of temporary
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances or for the long haul
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
keep up with
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
the rise in the property tax bill this
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
provides a vehicle for relief i should
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
have said that there's
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
a provision in here that caps the
 
02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:12.709 align:start position:0%
a provision in here that caps the
individual

02:16:12.709 --> 02:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
relief that will be provided at a
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
now that too could be changed but uh
 
02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
trying to assert some control over cost
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
in uh putting this thing together but a
 
02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars can be a big piece
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
of a bill
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
so we're not talking about peanuts here
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about real relief
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
one one way representative it's
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
interesting you might have
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
different constituents come to you
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
one might
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
be someone who owns
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
and i grew up in corner she used to go
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
to sunapee all the time as a little high
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
school kid
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
it might come to you i got a second home
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
on job's creek
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
and it's worth millions of dollars
 
02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:01.599 align:start position:0%
and how come
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
i'm paying this full tax at the rate
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
there's another person who might come to
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
you who says i've owned this property
 
02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.399 align:start position:0%
with my family this cabin on jobs creek
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i haven't sold it yet to have it
 
02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:15.190 align:start position:0%
and i haven't sold it yet to have it
rebuilt

02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
rebuilt
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the taxes are killing me and i'm on
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
a fixed income
 
02:17:21.990 --> 02:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
the answer that this bill gives is
 
02:17:24.230 --> 02:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have a state tax and everyone's going
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
to pay tax at the same rate
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
everybody but we've also provided
 
02:17:29.760 --> 02:17:30.870 align:start position:0%
everybody but we've also provided
special

02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
special
 
02:17:30.880 --> 02:17:31.990 align:start position:0%
special
targeted

02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
02:17:33.910 --> 02:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
tax relief
 
02:17:36.549 --> 02:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
for you because you need it more
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
and and i think that's the answer that
 
02:17:40.629 --> 02:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
is as direct as possible whereas the
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
prior donor town concept is
 
02:17:43.439 --> 02:17:44.389 align:start position:0%
prior donor town concept is
really

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
shielding that it's tax relief for
 
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
wealthy property taxpayers and
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
needy tax payers alike and i think
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's why this is a step forward for
 
03:10:25.030 --> 03:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:25.040 --> 03:10:52.710 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.950 --> 03:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
well representative vlad i
 
03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:39.349 --> 03:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:41.030 --> 03:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
well i guess we can probably tag team
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
this a little bit and folks are okay
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'll just try to pronounce it a little
 
03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
i'll just try to pronounce it a little
more

03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
more

two plus twos three plus ones any
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
articulation and the short answer is yes
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
we do a little of all of that
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
we do significant amount of two plus two
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
where students will come for two years
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
get their associate degree in that
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
entire package if you will will be taken
 
03:12:22.550 --> 03:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
on to the university system whether it's
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
plymouth keene granite state college has
 
03:12:26.550 --> 03:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
been a great partner in the past and
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
also you know in our northern new
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire plymouth state university
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
one program i like to
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
speak to is our north country teacher
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
certification program what that is is
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
our students will come through our white
 
03:12:43.269 --> 03:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
mountains community college teacher
 
03:12:45.510 --> 03:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
education program for two years they
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
will stay on and complete their
 
03:12:49.670 --> 03:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in berlin at the
 
03:12:51.910 --> 03:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
berlin campus through plymouth state
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
university that's our great relationship
 
03:12:55.670 --> 03:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
with plymouth and they end up getting a
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree physically on the
 
03:12:58.950 --> 03:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
berlin campus it just happens to be
 
03:13:00.550 --> 03:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
plymouth state's degree
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
so it saves our students the commuting
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
back and forth to plymouth which you
 
03:13:05.830 --> 03:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
know i know plymouth i can say this
 
03:13:07.429 --> 03:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
because i'm a i'm a graduate of plymouth
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
state plymouth says they're in the north
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
country there's a lot more further north
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
beyond plymouth so our our students who
 
03:13:15.030 --> 03:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
are in berlin it would be an hour and 15
 
03:13:16.950 --> 03:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
minutes you know back and forth so
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's one of the models we're also
 
03:13:20.950 --> 03:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
looking at uh three plus one types of
 
03:13:23.429 --> 03:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
models and other programs uh whereas
 
03:13:25.190 --> 03:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
students can complete their associate
 
03:13:27.030 --> 03:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
degree and then maybe go into a
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
different program for example liberal
 
03:13:31.750 --> 03:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
arts get another you know 24 to 30
 
03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:56.630 align:start position:0%
arts get another you know 24 to 30
credits

03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.790 --> 03:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'll only add to that that the one
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
unique program that that you re
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
reference representative ladd is the rn
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
to bsn program which is specifically set
 
03:14:07.349 --> 03:14:07.359 align:start position:0%
up as a three plus one program where the
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
students are taking 90 credits through
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
03:14:13.269 --> 03:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
the last 30 credits taken through
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
granite state college on behalf of the
 
03:14:17.910 --> 03:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
university system are still done at the
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
community college system tuition rate so
 
03:14:22.070 --> 03:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
adding to the savings for students
 
03:14:31.349 --> 03:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:33.110 --> 03:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
well it's a grant it's currently a
 
03:14:39.910 --> 03:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:45.439 --> 03:15:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
degrees

03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
with articulation agreements with all of
 
03:15:54.950 --> 03:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
the community college each of the
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
community colleges they have to be
 
03:16:00.710 --> 03:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
institution to institutions
 
03:16:02.950 --> 03:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then in a number of them
 
03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:06.229 align:start position:0%
and then in a number of them
um

03:16:06.229 --> 03:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
at nhti
 
03:16:11.670 --> 03:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
great bay there are additional
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:14.720 --> 03:17:37.590 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes and yes i guess number one i guess
 
03:17:41.349 --> 03:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
this is working now
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
number one if a student knows as they're
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
coming into white mountain community
 
03:17:45.910 --> 03:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
college where they want to eventually
 
03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
transfer that's that's ideal you know
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's plymouth state working with
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
a block transfer which has been very
 
03:17:52.950 --> 03:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
successful or if a student you know
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
knows they want to eventually go to unh
 
03:17:55.990 --> 03:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
but start their first two years if you
 
03:17:58.070 --> 03:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
know in advance we can work backwards
 
03:18:00.630 --> 03:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
and that's probably the easiest to do
 
03:18:02.469 --> 03:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
the second part of this when you mention
 
03:18:04.150 --> 03:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know if a student figures out along
 
03:18:05.670 --> 03:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
the way say they get a year year and a
 
03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
half in
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
the exact moment they know where they
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
want to go what they want to do we
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
connect them with an advisor you know
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
matt and i communicate all the time to
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
say all right you want to go to plymouth
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
let's start mapping out what do you have
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
done so far how will that apply but also
 
03:18:22.469 --> 03:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
what do you take next how much can you
 
03:18:24.309 --> 03:18:24.319 align:start position:0%
take you know the relationship with
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
plymouth has been great because it's not
 
03:18:27.429 --> 03:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily plymouth to say all right
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
let's get you as fast as we can
 
03:18:30.870 --> 03:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
let's get you when it makes sense for
 
03:18:30.880 --> 03:18:31.670 align:start position:0%
let's get you when it makes sense for
you

03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
in that okay if you stay another
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
semester you can save some money you
 
03:18:36.229 --> 03:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
don't need to come down yet because you
 
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
can get your general education out of
 
03:18:39.030 --> 03:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
the way now you're getting into the core
 
03:18:40.870 --> 03:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
discipline you know walking in as a
 
03:18:42.630 --> 03:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
junior now's the time where you'll want
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
to come down and figuring out what that
 
03:18:45.269 --> 03:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
so there is a it's a constant back and
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
forth to say it's you know perfect and
 
03:18:50.950 --> 03:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
lined up at every single way no it's
 
03:19:25.429 --> 03:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.389 --> 03:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
yes uh reversing woodcock
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:19:33.190 --> 03:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
gentlemen thank you for being here um
 
03:19:34.630 --> 03:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
sort of the same idea i was just
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
wondering is there a reason and i'm
 
03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
probably wrong there's a reason why
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
students can't take two years at any of
 
03:19:44.790 --> 03:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
the community colleges and automatically
 
03:19:47.429 --> 03:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
move in as a full junior
 
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
at all at all of the
 
03:19:51.429 --> 03:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
four-year at keane and
 
03:19:52.710 --> 03:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
plymouth and
 
03:19:54.710 --> 03:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
all of them i mean is there's a reason
 
03:19:57.750 --> 03:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
why or am i wrong they can
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just reinforce what reps on
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
woodcock's saying right now you all have
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
in front of you
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have a statute from tennessee
 
03:20:08.630 --> 03:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
if you did you get that
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
and i'll read it because it's i think
 
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's echoing exactly what represented
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
woodcock is saying it says an associate
 
03:20:17.030 --> 03:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
of science or associate of arts degree
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
graduate from a tennessee community
 
03:20:19.120 --> 03:20:20.070 align:start position:0%
graduate from a tennessee community
college

03:20:20.070 --> 03:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:20:22.229 --> 03:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
shall be deemed to have met all general
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
education and university parallel core
 
03:20:24.560 --> 03:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
education and university parallel core
requirements

03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
for for transfer to a tennessee public
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
university as a junior
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding this subdivision that
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'm reading right here admission into a
 
03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
particular program school or college
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
within a university or in to the
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
university of tennessee knoxville shall
 
03:20:44.630 --> 03:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
remain competitive competitive in
 
03:20:46.229 --> 03:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
accordance with generally applicable
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
policies so
 
03:20:49.670 --> 03:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's along the line what
 
03:20:51.269 --> 03:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that if you get an
 
03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
associate's degree whether it be at
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
white mountain or on the southern part
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
03:20:57.190 --> 03:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
why should that not
 
03:20:59.990 --> 03:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
count as your first two years and you
 
03:21:01.990 --> 03:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
come in if you're meeting the the
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
requirements as stipulated right here
 
03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it's a competitive process as a
 
03:21:05.680 --> 03:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
and it's a competitive process as a
junior

03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
junior
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
or should it
 
03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:16.150 align:start position:0%
or should it
so

03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:18.070 --> 03:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
a student who actually finishes the
 
03:21:21.429 --> 03:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
associate degree has at least 60 credits
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
and as long as those credits are all
 
03:21:26.550 --> 03:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
transferable in areas of the curriculum
 
03:21:28.710 --> 03:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
offered by the four-year institutions
 
03:21:30.070 --> 03:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
typically that student's going to have
 
03:21:32.150 --> 03:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
junior standing but if the students
 
03:21:33.349 --> 03:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
without the associate degree hasn't
 
03:21:37.110 --> 03:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
fulfilled all the degree requirements in
 
03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system and
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
depending on what program they were
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
pursuing if they're interested in
 
03:21:43.670 --> 03:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
engineering they might or might not have
 
03:21:45.429 --> 03:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
the prerequisites in math they might
 
03:21:46.950 --> 03:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
have the 60 credits they may have
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
satisfied an associated requirement
 
03:21:49.910 --> 03:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
still may not have the specific
 
03:21:51.910 --> 03:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
prerequisites lined up with a particular
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
program no different than a student who
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
starts at unh in liberal arts and in the
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
junior year decides that she or he wants
 
03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
to be an engineer may have to work
 
03:22:02.150 --> 03:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
backwards and fulfill whether it's it's
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
chemistry or physics or calculus so
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
again the 60 credits and the associate
 
03:22:09.190 --> 03:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
degree in hand generally will bring you
 
03:22:11.190 --> 03:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
in at the junior level but whether
 
03:22:13.110 --> 03:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
you've satisfied all the requirements
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
prerequisites that that now line you up
 
03:22:18.309 --> 03:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
perfectly for your junior year in a
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
particular major is going to be
 
03:22:22.950 --> 03:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
a product of which of the literally
 
03:22:25.110 --> 03:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
hundred different majors are available
 
03:22:27.750 --> 03:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the university system
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:48.399 --> 03:23:06.710 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll take some of this and i'll
 
03:23:09.590 --> 03:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
turn to my director of admissions at
 
03:23:11.910 --> 03:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
plymouth state after uh you know i would
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
say yes i think the short answer is yes
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
as long as the students are educated
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
about the process and you know across
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
all of our 100 high schools i'm sure
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's a different level of school
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
counseling that happens also different
 
03:23:23.040 --> 03:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
counseling that happens also different
level

03:23:24.070 --> 03:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
of outreach that occurs but by and large
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
i would say students know there are
 
03:23:27.359 --> 03:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
i would say students know there are
pathways

03:23:28.790 --> 03:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
pathways
 
03:23:30.150 --> 03:23:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know the easiest one to say is
 
03:23:31.750 --> 03:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
liberal arts which is general education
 
03:23:33.590 --> 03:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
when you're coming in you know students
 
03:23:35.190 --> 03:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
know that if they start basically at any
 
03:23:37.110 --> 03:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
of the community colleges they can go to
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
any i'm going to say the word any if
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
it's in liberal arts and walk in as a
 
03:23:42.150 --> 03:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
junior i think that's the easiest the
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
word i would also use is applicability
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh chancellor said it very eloquently
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
that you know depending on the program
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you start getting really specialized
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
you need to you know sometimes catch up
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
in different areas but the number of
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
credits does not change you're bringing
 
03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
them in
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
so i think students coming out of high
 
03:23:59.429 --> 03:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
school are well aware uh that there are
 
03:24:00.790 --> 03:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
these articulation agreements you know
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
they were printed off of our websites i
 
03:24:03.349 --> 03:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
think there were about four or five
 
03:24:06.150 --> 03:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
pages of them
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to follow up you use the
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
word applicability
 
03:24:12.309 --> 03:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at the tennessee statue it
 
03:24:14.150 --> 03:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
says comparative in accordance with
 
03:24:17.190 --> 03:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
generally applicable policies
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
so would that
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
would this statute that's there
 
03:24:21.920 --> 03:24:22.870 align:start position:0%
would this statute that's there
um

03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:25.670 --> 03:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
cover what you you've just presented to
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
us saying applicability there's it looks
 
03:24:30.389 --> 03:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
like they have that exception right here
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
has to be in accordance with the
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:38.309 --> 03:24:38.319 align:start position:0%
i also defer to director admissions over
 
03:24:40.630 --> 03:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
here a little bit yeah when i when we're
 
03:24:41.990 --> 03:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
looking at students who are going to be
 
03:24:43.429 --> 03:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
transferring in
 
03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
we'll take the liberal arts block
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
transfer for instance
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
that program has 13 or so that we can
 
03:24:52.389 --> 03:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
guarantee students coming in to
 
03:24:54.309 --> 03:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
have completing in two years once
 
03:24:55.429 --> 03:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
they're here
 
03:24:57.830 --> 03:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
but if they're coming into nursing right
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
at most of the usnh schools it's very
 
03:25:02.469 --> 03:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
hard to transfer in nursing because of
 
03:25:04.309 --> 03:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
the course progression they want to come
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
in as a biology student there's certain
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
progressions of classes that in the
 
03:25:11.429 --> 03:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
liberal arts associates degree they will
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
not have met those first and second year
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
requirements to then progress at that
 
03:25:17.590 --> 03:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
same rate so
 
03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
yes that's to say
 
03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
if it works with the program with each
 
03:25:24.710 --> 03:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
institution's curriculum they should be
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
able to make through but there's those
 
03:25:31.110 --> 03:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:31.120 --> 03:25:33.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:25:33.510 --> 03:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
go ahead let uh moffitt and then you uh
 
03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
kathy provincial
 
03:25:39.670 --> 03:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's on deck
 
03:25:42.150 --> 03:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr and as a true
 
03:25:44.070 --> 03:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
north country native i want to say that
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
dr lloyd is correct that plymouth really
 
03:25:50.070 --> 03:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
is not part of the north country
 
03:25:50.080 --> 03:25:51.269 align:start position:0%
is not part of the north country
uh

03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:52.790 --> 03:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative ford is back he's the
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
sole sponsor of this measure and um
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
as i read it uh
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
it it reads uh about granting bachelor's
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
degrees and a program of study in which
 
03:26:06.389 --> 03:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree is not offered or
 
03:26:07.910 --> 03:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
available at any institution in the
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
university system he's back he can speak
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
to that as i read that i'm i'm thinking
 
03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if his sense is that maybe
 
03:26:17.990 --> 03:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
this would you're trying to create
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation so that a community
 
03:26:24.150 --> 03:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
college perhaps in a certain niche
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
could could develop a uh bachelor
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
program i guess not know that
 
03:26:30.150 --> 03:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative ford's back maybe could
 
03:26:30.160 --> 03:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
representative ford's back maybe could
could

03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:26:33.510 --> 03:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:26:35.359 --> 03:26:37.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
uh

03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:39.830 --> 03:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes in the simple answer
 
03:26:42.870 --> 03:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
what i was looking for was enabling a
 
03:26:42.880 --> 03:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
what i was looking for was enabling a
discussion

03:26:44.070 --> 03:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:26:45.750 --> 03:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
which would address and i have
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence that i've had both with
 
03:26:50.870 --> 03:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:53.429 --> 03:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
chancellor and the predecessor in which
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
we had discussions both of us about the
 
03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
goal was
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
to basically
 
03:27:02.070 --> 03:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
make the transition from associate to
 
03:27:02.080 --> 03:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
make the transition from associate to
baccalaureate

03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate
 
03:27:06.469 --> 03:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
an accessible reality
 
03:27:09.190 --> 03:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
a reality device and i was thinking in
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
my mind of and i intentionally took
 
03:27:14.710 --> 03:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
examples like the diesel engineering
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
technology and management
 
03:27:19.750 --> 03:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
because i know that nobody ever
 
03:27:22.710 --> 03:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
transferred from that to humanities
 
03:27:25.269 --> 03:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
because i taught humanities for a long
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
time and it's just not something in the
 
03:27:29.190 --> 03:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
mindset of people who are studying for
 
03:27:31.110 --> 03:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
that that goes into this and so i took
 
03:27:33.349 --> 03:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
two things that were polar opposite
 
03:27:36.870 --> 03:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
and i just said if they wanted to
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
could they then proceed to a bachelor's
 
03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:39.750 align:start position:0%
could they then proceed to a bachelor's
degree

03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
and how would they do that and the thing
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
is there's no place to go no one else
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
offers that
 
03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
so how could you if you say had it in
 
03:27:51.830 --> 03:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
mind that you wanted to be a military
 
03:27:51.840 --> 03:27:53.030 align:start position:0%
mind that you wanted to be a military
officer

03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
to get a commission in the u.s military
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
you have to have a bachelor's degree
 
03:28:00.630 --> 03:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what it's in it could
 
03:28:03.190 --> 03:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
be in french history
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
but you have to have a bachelor's degree
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
then you can get a commission
 
03:28:08.950 --> 03:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then if you're like me suddenly one
 
03:28:10.630 --> 03:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
day they look at you and say you're the
 
03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
motor transport officer i have a degree
 
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
in english
 
03:28:16.870 --> 03:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
you see the disconnect
 
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
but the guy in that diesel technology he
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
knows all about that he could have done
 
03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
a much better job or she for that matter
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
than i could have done
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
no matter how long i stayed doing it
 
03:28:29.670 --> 03:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
and so i'm thinking in those
 
03:28:32.070 --> 03:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
terminologies when we're educating
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
students typically we talk about
 
03:28:34.479 --> 03:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
students typically we talk about
students

03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
working in a job that's here but not all
 
03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
the careers our students aspire to are
 
03:28:40.880 --> 03:28:41.910 align:start position:0%
the careers our students aspire to are
here

03:28:41.910 --> 03:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
some of them are with the federal
 
03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
government or the army or anybody else
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
and so i'm looking at how do we get that
 
03:28:49.520 --> 03:28:50.830 align:start position:0%
and so i'm looking at how do we get that
person

03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:28:50.840 --> 03:28:52.790 align:start position:0%
person
into

03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
that career path
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
and the probability just like the the
 
03:28:59.670 --> 03:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
para educators
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
who are bound to a place and want to
 
03:29:04.830 --> 03:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
become a teacher they can't go away to
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
college they have families they have
 
03:29:09.110 --> 03:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
jobs they need health care
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
part of the problem we have to sign
 
03:29:13.990 --> 03:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
to have to solve is how to get them what
 
03:29:16.950 --> 03:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
they need in order to make that possible
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
to answer your question representative
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
that's the motive behind all of this
 
03:29:24.550 --> 03:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
is how do we provide
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
access to baccalaureate education via
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
the community colleges
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
by via mean they might be the first two
 
03:29:33.190 --> 03:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
years and then where does that go well
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
if that receiving institution
 
03:29:37.990 --> 03:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
has faculty that don't want to travel
 
03:29:40.150 --> 03:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
down there does that block the will of
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:29:44.229 --> 03:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
how do we accomplish that
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
that's what i see that's being discussed
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
is how do we make that possible
 
03:29:53.670 --> 03:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.070 --> 03:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh reps uh uh kathy provencher had her
 
03:29:58.950 --> 03:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
hand up and we went with moffitt uh
 
03:30:00.790 --> 03:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you know and then you take over i
 
03:30:03.670 --> 03:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
think we should have the
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
no longer chancellor
 
03:30:08.550 --> 03:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
no longer state treasurer
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
kathy provencher you
 
03:30:10.720 --> 03:30:11.670 align:start position:0%
kathy provencher you
you

03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
do you have your button pushed there
 
03:30:20.960 --> 03:30:22.309 align:start position:0%
do you have your button pushed there
there

03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
if a student at the community college
 
03:30:24.640 --> 03:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
if a student at the community college
system

03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
knows what path they want to take and um
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
chuck's right that's not always the case
 
03:30:35.910 --> 03:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
but again there there are there are a
 
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
pathway to
 
03:30:40.150 --> 03:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
30 plus degrees that you could transfer
 
03:30:40.160 --> 03:30:41.269 align:start position:0%
30 plus degrees that you could transfer
from

03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:30:43.190 --> 03:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
any community college
 
03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:44.469 align:start position:0%
any community college
to

03:30:44.469 --> 03:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:30:46.630 --> 03:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the universe biology
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
is one of them
 
03:30:48.319 --> 03:30:49.110 align:start position:0%
is one of them
um

03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
again if if you didn't know that when
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
you entered
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
school you might have to pick up a
 
03:30:56.469 --> 03:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
course here or there but there again
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's online very clear pathways to
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the a degree that that
 
03:31:04.710 --> 03:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
will transfer
 
03:31:08.389 --> 03:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:10.710 --> 03:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
and to representative ford's earlier
 
03:31:10.720 --> 03:31:12.550 align:start position:0%
and to representative ford's earlier
comment

03:31:12.550 --> 03:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
comment
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
you're right i don't i i don't with the
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
diesel mechanics i don't know anything
 
03:31:18.229 --> 03:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
about that so i don't there's probably i
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take that question a
 
03:31:24.550 --> 03:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
need or you know for that
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
a program like that
 
03:31:28.469 --> 03:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
if the chair would like i can address
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that question specifically no i'm i'm no
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
longer chair i'm not the chair of the
 
03:31:34.389 --> 03:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee chair of education
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative ford is the chair of the
 
03:31:35.760 --> 03:31:39.349 align:start position:0%
representative ford is the chair of the
subcommittee

03:31:39.349 --> 03:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you diesel heavy equipment
 
03:31:42.550 --> 03:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
technology great program these are the
 
03:31:44.309 --> 03:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
folks that are working on on-road
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
off-road equipment uh milton caterpillar
 
03:31:49.110 --> 03:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
john d or kubota to kenworth trucks mack
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
trucks i mean these are these are the
 
03:31:53.030 --> 03:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
people that keep things going uh
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent program when we're
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
thinking about bachelor's degree you
 
03:31:59.349 --> 03:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
know articulation or transfer we say if
 
03:32:01.590 --> 03:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
there is somebody that is interested do
 
03:32:03.429 --> 03:32:03.439 align:start position:0%
we have a partner and i'm sorry i can't
 
03:32:05.670 --> 03:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
see you with obstructed few here do we
 
03:32:07.990 --> 03:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
have a partner that is interested in
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
offering that program and in this case
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
global skill up in new york has a
 
03:32:13.830 --> 03:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
program we've sent two students in the
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
last 13 years to that
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
to complete the bachelor's degree just
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
for what you're saying if something does
 
03:32:20.309 --> 03:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
require a bachelor's degree they've got
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
it a lot of those students wind up if
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
they want to pursue higher ed they'll
 
03:32:25.429 --> 03:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
get a business or accounting degree
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
because they'll either open their own
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
business they'll work up into management
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
senior management at milton cad or
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be but we also look
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
about student interest just like kathy
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
provincial was just saying is there an
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
interest our students typically will
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
come in for a certificate an associate's
 
03:32:42.550 --> 03:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
degree or they can go right out you know
 
03:32:44.710 --> 03:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
after that and start making great money
 
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
frankly right away with that associate
 
03:32:48.070 --> 03:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
degree or
 
03:32:49.830 --> 03:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
or otherwise
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
the other piece we look at is industry
 
03:32:54.950 --> 03:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
demand meaning is it an entry point will
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
people be hired with a certificate or an
 
03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
associate degree or is the bachelor's
 
03:33:00.870 --> 03:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
degree required at this point not even
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
just given this current you know economy
 
03:33:05.190 --> 03:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
but even prior years back
 
03:33:06.950 --> 03:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
the entry point is a certificate or
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
associate degree to get hired to get
 
03:33:10.150 --> 03:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
promoted to work your way and have a
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
great job so it's not necessarily a
 
03:33:13.830 --> 03:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
barrier to not have that bachelor's
 
03:33:15.349 --> 03:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
degree so those are typically the three
 
03:33:17.429 --> 03:33:17.439 align:start position:0%
areas we spend time on is is there an
 
03:33:19.269 --> 03:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
industry need is there student interest
 
03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
or is there an existing pathway
 
03:33:23.110 --> 03:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
in this case you know we check all of
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
those boxes for diesel heavy equipment
 
03:33:26.630 --> 03:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
which you know it is we are the only one
 
03:33:27.750 --> 03:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire with the only
 
03:33:29.349 --> 03:33:29.359 align:start position:0%
accredited new england i'm not sure the
 
03:33:31.510 --> 03:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
university system wants to get into that
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
particular area you know for a transfer
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
but you know right now that checks all
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the boxes and i know you're just using
 
03:33:39.110 --> 03:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
that as an example but we use that same
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy whenever we're looking at any
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
of our programs working through each of
 
03:33:45.429 --> 03:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
those three areas
 
03:33:46.710 --> 03:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that led me to that
 
03:33:51.349 --> 03:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
question is my own personal experience
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
i started out as a geology major
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
i switched to english when there were no
 
03:33:58.469 --> 03:33:58.479 align:start position:0%
jobs in geology
 
03:34:00.790 --> 03:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
i was working in an oil company when
 
03:34:02.150 --> 03:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
that happened
 
03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
there were people down the street with
 
03:34:05.990 --> 03:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
master's degrees from colorado school of
 
03:34:09.190 --> 03:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
mines and they were selling used cars
 
03:34:11.030 --> 03:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly an incentive to
 
03:34:13.510 --> 03:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
finish your major and plunge ahead
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
so i shifted to english i had no idea
 
03:34:18.950 --> 03:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
what that involved it was just
 
03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
fortuitous that at my university all the
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
gen ed and everything fit but i wound up
 
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
taking a lot of science courses micro
 
03:34:30.389 --> 03:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
paleontology for example that most
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
people didn't take
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
but when they i look at those
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
people who are in the jobs like para
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
educator who are not from this country
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
don't speak english as a native language
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
don't trust banks
 
03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
the banks are working to get them to be
 
03:34:47.439 --> 03:34:48.469 align:start position:0%
the banks are working to get them to be
banked

03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
banked
 
03:34:50.550 --> 03:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
and so they're trying to train people in
 
03:34:53.030 --> 03:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
high school about how to work in a bank
 
03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
and what you need to know and they're
 
03:34:56.710 --> 03:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
buying the computers
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
so i look at myself and i'm looking at
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
our situation thinking
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.389 --> 03:35:06.399 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
03:35:08.309 --> 03:35:08.319 align:start position:0%
what does that do when we say these
 
03:35:10.469 --> 03:35:10.479 align:start position:0%
people get health insurance or these
 
03:35:12.550 --> 03:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
people need a computer to do it when
 
03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:14.479 align:start position:0%
we're not providing it for every other
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
kid in the state
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
but these students are different
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
many are married with families
 
03:35:22.710 --> 03:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
and they're dependent on that health and
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
they cannot progress in their careers
 
03:35:27.030 --> 03:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
toward becoming a teacher which would be
 
03:35:28.630 --> 03:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
a benefit to us all because they're
 
03:35:31.590 --> 03:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
already bilingual
 
03:35:34.710 --> 03:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
so we get two banks for the buck
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
but we can't get them there without
 
03:35:41.190 --> 03:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:41.200 --> 03:35:42.389 align:start position:0%
 
mr

03:35:42.389 --> 03:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
mr
 
03:35:44.630 --> 03:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
the kind of question i'm throwing out mr
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%
chair i got a question here yeah and
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's several questions i think others
 
03:35:48.720 --> 03:35:50.070 align:start position:0%
there's several questions i think others
um

03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
is it so that if you're
 
03:35:54.630 --> 03:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
graduate with a two-year associate's
 
03:35:56.389 --> 03:35:56.399 align:start position:0%
degree from white mountain
 
03:35:59.190 --> 03:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
you can go down to psu now and enroll as
 
03:36:00.469 --> 03:36:00.479 align:start position:0%
a junior
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
is that irregardless of what your
 
03:36:05.190 --> 03:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
associate's degree is in
 
03:36:07.590 --> 03:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
or is it a standard operating procedure
 
03:36:10.070 --> 03:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
you walk in as a junior
 
03:36:11.910 --> 03:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
in accordance with you know
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the you know the
 
03:36:13.439 --> 03:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the you know the
admission

03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
admission
 
03:36:18.309 --> 03:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh prerequisites at that particular
 
03:36:20.870 --> 03:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
degree you might be seeking i would say
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
in most programs i'll go back to what
 
03:36:25.110 --> 03:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
matt was saying earlier of you know in
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
in nursing it might be difficult
 
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the sequencing uh maybe a
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
couple of other programs but i would say
 
03:36:32.309 --> 03:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
by and large i think you listed 13. we
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
have a great new block transfer you know
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
arrangement that has worked out really
 
03:36:35.760 --> 03:36:36.550 align:start position:0%
arrangement that has worked out really
well

03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
i would never say a hundred percent all
 
03:36:39.429 --> 03:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
or i would never use the word
 
03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
03:36:44.070 --> 03:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh woodson would saw excuse me glare
 
03:36:45.750 --> 03:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
over there
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
you use the word automatically and i
 
03:36:49.750 --> 03:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
never use automatically uh but by and
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
03:36:57.510 --> 03:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
sure i'm just i was trying to get a
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
clarity from rather than forward on his
 
03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
clarity from rather than forward on his
bill

03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:37:04.150 --> 03:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
i know he's leaving
 
03:37:04.160 --> 03:37:05.429 align:start position:0%
i know he's leaving
um

03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:05.439 --> 03:37:06.469 align:start position:0%
um
bill

03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:37:08.550 --> 03:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
specifically the work session was around
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that i presume yes i understand
 
03:37:12.870 --> 03:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
the pathway system um
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
this bill as is
 
03:37:15.990 --> 03:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
you all have a chance to see it or read
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
it okay so if i understand what he's
 
03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
looking for besides
 
03:37:22.790 --> 03:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the connection um that he's specifically
 
03:37:24.790 --> 03:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
looking for community colleges like
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
white mountain
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the ability to offer
 
03:37:28.080 --> 03:37:29.429 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the ability to offer
baccalaureates

03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
baccalaureates
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping that uh while you're here
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
you can address the intent of the bill
 
03:37:35.040 --> 03:37:35.910 align:start position:0%
you can address the intent of the bill
um

03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:37.349 --> 03:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
because that's that's that's where we go
 
03:37:39.670 --> 03:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's where this is going
 
03:37:41.910 --> 03:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
versus the dialogue on the pathway yeah
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
and it probably should be stated for
 
03:37:44.630 --> 03:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
this group we've invited representative
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
ford to come to a subcommittee of our
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
board of trustees he came
 
03:37:49.990 --> 03:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
student success committee we talked you
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
know quite at length actually
 
03:37:53.349 --> 03:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
as the community college system of new
 
03:37:55.190 --> 03:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire we're already authorized to
 
03:37:57.110 --> 03:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
offer bachelor's degrees it's in our
 
03:37:59.349 --> 03:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
statutes i believe it's a board of
 
03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
trustee policy
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
so we are allowed to uh for us we've
 
03:38:05.910 --> 03:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
really chosen to work with our existing
 
03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:07.030 align:start position:0%
really chosen to work with our existing
partners

03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
partners
 
03:38:09.269 --> 03:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
and really evaluate articulation just
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
through that so
 
03:38:12.469 --> 03:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
i don't know about enabling legislation
 
03:38:15.429 --> 03:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
but we are currently allowed to i i
 
03:38:16.870 --> 03:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
would ask
 
03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
where did you find that statute if
 
03:38:21.590 --> 03:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
if i might sir
 
03:38:25.030 --> 03:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
the the language in statute in 188f
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
basically says that we are up
 
03:38:30.870 --> 03:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
we are authorized to award degrees as is
 
03:38:32.309 --> 03:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
common for
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
two-year institutions i'm familiar with
 
03:38:36.710 --> 03:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
that part of it we don't presume that
 
03:38:38.710 --> 03:38:38.720 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the legislature and
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
similar to the university system in
 
03:38:43.110 --> 03:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
asking the legislature for clarity about
 
03:38:45.030 --> 03:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
whether granite state the merger with
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
unh is
 
03:38:48.389 --> 03:38:48.399 align:start position:0%
acceptable we would we would certainly
 
03:38:50.469 --> 03:38:50.479 align:start position:0%
come back but we do think that the way
 
03:38:52.469 --> 03:38:52.479 align:start position:0%
the language is currently crafted now
 
03:38:54.309 --> 03:38:54.319 align:start position:0%
that more than half of the states allow
 
03:38:56.229 --> 03:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
community colleges to offer four-year
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
degrees we think that the language is is
 
03:38:59.520 --> 03:39:01.269 align:start position:0%
degrees we think that the language is is
there

03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
i can just echo
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
what the
 
03:39:08.870 --> 03:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee in higher education
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
study came up with what six years ago
 
03:39:14.950 --> 03:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
and as a flat no
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
um you do not offer a four-year degree
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
at the community college level
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
that that's where they you know the
 
03:39:25.189 --> 03:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
legislature was now we it's not in law
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
but i think that the message was
 
03:39:29.590 --> 03:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
conveyed at that time
 
03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
so i i if i may i as i said we we don't
 
03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
presume that we understand that or or or
 
03:39:38.309 --> 03:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
accept that that's
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
something we would do if we thought we
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
should do it we would come for
 
03:39:41.359 --> 03:39:42.790 align:start position:0%
should do it we would come for
legislative

03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
okay endorsement on that one
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
to the question that representative
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
woodcock asked earlier it's also not our
 
03:39:50.950 --> 03:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
intent right now to offer four-year
 
03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
degrees as president lloyd said our
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
interest is really in working with the
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
university system
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
the needs that our students have and and
 
03:39:59.590 --> 03:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
align with what representative ford was
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
describing earlier the needs that
 
03:40:03.030 --> 03:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
working adults have which are the
 
03:40:05.349 --> 03:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
majority of our students are for the
 
03:40:07.510 --> 03:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
education they need now it may be a
 
03:40:09.510 --> 03:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
building block to a four-year degree
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
eventually but sometimes what they need
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
is what they need right now and our
 
03:40:15.269 --> 03:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
effort is to try and provide things that
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
are more aligned with that need in the
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
workforce for working adults maybe a
 
03:40:21.990 --> 03:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
certificate maybe an associate degree
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the course that they need that
 
03:40:25.349 --> 03:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
takes them one step further than they
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:32.469 --> 03:40:32.479 align:start position:0%
where where is your accreditation in
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
03:40:37.830 --> 03:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
offering a four-year degree right now
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
you're accredited by the same
 
03:40:42.389 --> 03:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
institution that credits the four years
 
03:40:42.399 --> 03:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
institution that credits the four years
so

03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:44.710 --> 03:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
when they
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
they say that your introductory course
 
03:40:49.269 --> 03:40:49.279 align:start position:0%
and literature
 
03:40:51.429 --> 03:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
is an is a
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
accredited course or you know you credit
 
03:40:55.990 --> 03:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
the universe the system
 
03:40:56.000 --> 03:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
the universe the system
but

03:40:57.510 --> 03:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
03:41:00.630 --> 03:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
is there anything any hoops you have to
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
jump through to to make it now a
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
four-year degree course or program or is
 
03:41:08.630 --> 03:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
it just you got accredited so it's good
 
03:41:09.670 --> 03:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
to go
 
03:41:12.389 --> 03:41:12.399 align:start position:0%
we're regionally accredited by the new
 
03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
england commission on higher education
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
the same accrediting body that that
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
accredits the usnh institutions but the
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
courses themselves are not accredited
 
03:41:23.670 --> 03:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're authorized to award degrees
 
03:41:25.590 --> 03:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to begin to offer
 
03:41:27.510 --> 03:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
additional degrees at a different level
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
we would go back and file for
 
03:41:31.189 --> 03:41:31.199 align:start position:0%
substantive change so netchie would
 
03:41:33.269 --> 03:41:33.279 align:start position:0%
require you to come back
 
03:41:33.279 --> 03:41:34.469 align:start position:0%
require you to come back
and

03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
state that now we're going for a
 
03:41:37.670 --> 03:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
four-year degree i believe that's
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
03:41:48.870 --> 03:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
in actuality as opposed to just
 
03:41:48.880 --> 03:41:50.150 align:start position:0%
in actuality as opposed to just
principle

03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
principle
 
03:41:52.389 --> 03:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
how transferable
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
are each of the courses that you take
 
03:41:57.510 --> 03:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
for instance if i take two semesters of
 
03:41:59.189 --> 03:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
an english
 
03:41:59.199 --> 03:42:00.150 align:start position:0%
an english
at

03:42:00.150 --> 03:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:42:00.160 --> 03:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
at
wherever

03:42:01.670 --> 03:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then i go
 
03:42:05.910 --> 03:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
to someplace else
 
03:42:09.429 --> 03:42:09.439 align:start position:0%
how you know how specific does it have
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:42:16.710 --> 03:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:16.720 --> 03:42:18.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
prevailing guidelines regionally
 
03:42:22.389 --> 03:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
accredited institutions will typically
 
03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
accept as transfer credit coursework
 
03:42:27.269 --> 03:42:27.279 align:start position:0%
that's documented on an official
 
03:42:29.990 --> 03:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
transcript with a grade of c or better
 
03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
for a regionally another regionally
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
accredited institution so the credits
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
almost always will transfer as long as
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
that receiving institution offers the
 
03:42:41.590 --> 03:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
program in the same area of the
 
03:42:41.600 --> 03:42:43.269 align:start position:0%
program in the same area of the
curriculum

03:42:43.269 --> 03:42:43.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
03:42:44.710 --> 03:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
the place where it sometimes gets
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
complicated is whether it satisfies a
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
degree requirement so you may end up
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
with a lot of elective credits
 
03:42:52.389 --> 03:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
transferring but not necessarily making
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
progress toward a degree
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
over the last several years a good deal
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
of work has been done our colleague
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
leslie barber who's a faculty member at
 
03:43:01.269 --> 03:43:01.279 align:start position:0%
great bay community college has done
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
extensive work with the university
 
03:43:06.389 --> 03:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
system to map individual courses course
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
by course so that the course actually
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
satisfies a specific requirement at the
 
03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
usnh institutions beyond that uh what mr
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
wallace was describing for for plymouth
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
the block transfer
 
03:43:21.269 --> 03:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the courses were and
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
i assume this is true regardless of what
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
the grade is the student who's
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
transferring the associate degree will
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
receive 60 credits and will start as a
 
03:43:30.229 --> 03:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
junior in that program so it's
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
alleviated some of the
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
specifics of a grade below c for
 
03:43:35.349 --> 03:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
instance and you know at a home
 
03:43:37.030 --> 03:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
institution a student may receive credit
 
03:43:39.269 --> 03:43:39.279 align:start position:0%
for passing a course with a d normally
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't transfer but under the
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
block arrangement i assume that that's
 
03:43:44.950 --> 03:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
the exception
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
you are correct on that
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's just that's for business and
 
03:43:51.750 --> 03:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
liberal arts not for all of our programs
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay and i was asking partly because my
 
03:43:54.560 --> 03:43:56.229 align:start position:0%
okay and i was asking partly because my
daughter-in-law

03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
daughter-in-law
 
03:43:58.870 --> 03:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
took i can't tell you in you know the
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
gen ed courses i can't tell you how many
 
03:44:04.630 --> 03:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
times because she kept you know it was
 
03:44:07.349 --> 03:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
like well this year now our beginning
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
our freshman english now looks like this
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
and you took it last year and it doesn't
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
look like that
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
and i just wonder
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
that she was in massachusetts and i'm
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
wondering how here in new hampshire
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
how much
 
03:44:25.030 --> 03:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's an issue or how much you say okay
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
you took it it was the freshman english
 
03:44:31.269 --> 03:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
you know then and it counts as
 
03:44:34.229 --> 03:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:36.790 --> 03:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
i i think it's fair to say the work that
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
professor barber has done the work that
 
03:44:41.110 --> 03:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
that plymouth has done the work that
 
03:44:43.269 --> 03:44:43.279 align:start position:0%
granite has done all of that effort has
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
been to try and minimize the likelihood
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
that a student wastes time and money
 
03:44:48.950 --> 03:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
having to repeat essentially the same
 
03:44:50.950 --> 03:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
course students have almost always had
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do credit by
 
03:44:53.830 --> 03:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
examination to demonstrate the
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
proficiency but it's an additional step
 
03:44:58.309 --> 03:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
and often it derails students or at
 
03:45:00.630 --> 03:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
least becomes a barrier so we've done a
 
03:45:02.550 --> 03:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
lot between the two systems to try and
 
03:45:05.189 --> 03:45:05.199 align:start position:0%
lessen the likelihood that that happens
 
03:45:07.590 --> 03:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much in section two of
 
03:45:09.110 --> 03:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:45:12.710 --> 03:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's a roman 17 a which will
 
03:45:15.030 --> 03:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
authorize would authorize if it became
 
03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
law the community college to offer
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
four-year degrees if those four-year
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
degrees were not offered at the
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
university system level
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
um i'd be curious to know what is your
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
position on that i'd like to also know
 
03:45:28.870 --> 03:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
from the university system what their
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
as president lloyd described earlier
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
we've we first want to make sure that
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
there's a value to the student that
 
03:45:40.389 --> 03:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
there's a real demand for that in the
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
marketplace that employers would value
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
it that students want it and that it
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
justifies the cost of delivering it if
 
03:45:49.269 --> 03:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
all of those conditions were met we
 
03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
would approach the university system to
 
03:45:53.830 --> 03:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
see if we could not get a partnership to
 
03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
deliver similar what dr lloyd has
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
created with plymouth on the education
 
03:45:57.439 --> 03:46:00.630 align:start position:0%
created with plymouth on the education
program

03:46:00.630 --> 03:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh kathy can you respond to that i'd
 
03:46:04.150 --> 03:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
like for example
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't think
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire has a
 
03:46:09.670 --> 03:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
physical therapy maybe they do now or
 
03:46:11.269 --> 03:46:11.279 align:start position:0%
maybe yeah they do have that they come
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
from the main to your physical therapy
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
program but there must be some programs
 
03:46:18.870 --> 03:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
that you don't offer that you have
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
agreements with other states for our
 
03:46:22.790 --> 03:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
students to go to
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that's one way of handling this
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
rather than the community college system
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
starting a new program up i'm just a
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
little confused as far as where we're
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
going here
 
03:46:33.120 --> 03:46:34.469 align:start position:0%
going here
in

03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
expanding programs at a time when we are
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
03:46:40.150 --> 03:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know realize that our
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
our margins shrinking and shrinking and
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
shrinking i think representative i mean
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
that's our concern as
 
03:46:47.670 --> 03:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
the community college system is
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.189 --> 03:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's not a good time to expand programs
 
03:46:55.030 --> 03:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
we'd have to really understand what the
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
demand is
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
president lloyd mentioned there were two
 
03:47:02.309 --> 03:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
people in the last 13 years that wanted
 
03:47:04.389 --> 03:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
a bachelor's degree in diesel mechanics
 
03:47:05.750 --> 03:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and they found a place for them in new
 
03:47:05.760 --> 03:47:06.950 align:start position:0%
and they found a place for them in new
york

03:47:06.950 --> 03:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
york
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
that's probably of
 
03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
that is a good way to handle it rather
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
than develop a four-year degree
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
when the demand isn't there
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
and and you're spot on representative
 
03:47:19.680 --> 03:47:20.790 align:start position:0%
and and you're spot on representative
lad

03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
lad
 
03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:21.750 align:start position:0%
lad
our

03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
our pool of students is shrinking
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so we need to think about that for
 
03:47:28.070 --> 03:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
the future and
 
03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh to chancellor rubenstein's point if
 
03:47:34.469 --> 03:47:34.479 align:start position:0%
there is a demand for a four-year degree
 
03:47:37.189 --> 03:47:37.199 align:start position:0%
we should work together and
 
03:47:41.429 --> 03:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing we haven't talked about
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
because it's not degree related but um
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
credent micro credentialing and badging
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
is is really
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
where much of higher education is going
 
03:47:55.990 --> 03:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we add on or
 
03:47:57.510 --> 03:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
help a student
 
03:47:58.830 --> 03:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
stack on
 
03:48:01.510 --> 03:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
credentials rather than degree seeking
 
03:48:01.520 --> 03:48:03.110 align:start position:0%
credentials rather than degree seeking
and

03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
community college system and university
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
system also in the middle of
 
03:48:08.950 --> 03:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
those conversations to see how we
 
03:48:08.960 --> 03:48:10.630 align:start position:0%
those conversations to see how we
partner

03:48:10.630 --> 03:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
partner
 
03:48:12.309 --> 03:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
to benefit
 
03:48:15.189 --> 03:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
a whole host of students and
 
03:48:17.349 --> 03:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
and businesses in
 
03:48:19.590 --> 03:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
micro credentialing and badging i've got
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
to leave in a few moments that's a
 
03:48:23.670 --> 03:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
discussion we need to get into i hope
 
03:48:25.189 --> 03:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
the community college system has been
 
03:48:27.429 --> 03:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
very aggressive in seeking these skill
 
03:48:30.309 --> 03:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
pathways and and certification
 
03:48:30.319 --> 03:48:31.670 align:start position:0%
pathways and and certification
credentials

03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned shrinking demographic
 
03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:36.229 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned shrinking demographic
if

03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
the four-year system starts doing what
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the two-year system has been chasing the
 
03:48:41.990 --> 03:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
two-year system starts going in the
 
03:48:44.630 --> 03:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
direction what the four year is
 
03:48:44.640 --> 03:48:46.229 align:start position:0%
direction what the four year is
um

03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
are we doing the what we should be doing
 
03:48:50.309 --> 03:48:50.319 align:start position:0%
you talk about collaboration that seems
 
03:48:51.670 --> 03:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
like a better way of
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
moving down the road to me
 
03:48:56.070 --> 03:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
than than everybody's starting to take
 
03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
everybody else's
 
03:48:58.479 --> 03:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
everybody else's
bailiwick

03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
well that's what that's what is so
 
03:49:06.790 --> 03:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
important about continuing to partner
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
right we're just gonna eat each other
 
03:49:11.110 --> 03:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
and that's not going to serve
 
03:49:14.790 --> 03:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
either system or the state or students
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's our new reality
 
03:49:20.229 --> 03:49:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i and maybe represent luna can talk
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
to some of the mission statements or the
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
purpose of where we're going
 
03:49:23.199 --> 03:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
purpose of where we're going
representative

03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:53.520 --> 03:50:32.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:32.950 --> 03:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
not um

03:50:51.349 --> 03:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.359 --> 03:51:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:03.750 --> 03:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.760 --> 03:51:14.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.720 --> 03:51:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
maybe

03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.319 --> 03:51:47.110 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:51:47.110 --> 03:51:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:47.120 --> 03:51:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.800 --> 03:52:28.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.319 --> 03:52:38.950 align:start position:0%
 
in

03:52:38.950 --> 03:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.960 --> 03:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
 
as particular

03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.269 --> 03:53:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:53.279 --> 03:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.750 --> 03:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:21.760 --> 03:54:33.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:54:33.269 --> 03:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.279 --> 03:55:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:55:34.950 --> 03:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
i'm on my way out the door right now to
 
03:55:38.950 --> 03:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
see another president so
 
03:55:40.469 --> 03:55:40.479 align:start position:0%
i've got to leave right now i'm going to
 
03:55:44.469 --> 03:55:44.479 align:start position:0%
go back up and talk to don right now
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
but i
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
my my hope is that
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
that somewhere along the way that a
 
03:55:51.110 --> 03:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
person that completes an associate's
 
03:55:51.120 --> 03:55:52.229 align:start position:0%
person that completes an associate's
degree

03:55:52.229 --> 03:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
degree
 
03:55:55.189 --> 03:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
can walk into a four-year school as a
 
03:55:55.199 --> 03:55:56.790 align:start position:0%
can walk into a four-year school as a
junior

03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
junior
 
03:55:59.189 --> 03:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
if that person measures up to the
 
03:55:59.199 --> 03:56:00.469 align:start position:0%
if that person measures up to the
applicable

03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
rationale and prerequisites for the
 
03:56:04.630 --> 03:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
program they're walking into a and i
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
would hope that all the courses that you
 
03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
take innocent associates level would
 
03:56:10.630 --> 03:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
count towards a liberal arts student
 
03:56:13.750 --> 03:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
coming in in any one of our
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
four or three
 
03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
campuses right now uh at the university
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
level as a junior
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the economy today
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
the costs
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
of an education are horrendous and
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to
 
03:56:32.399 --> 03:56:33.510 align:start position:0%
we can't afford to
lose

03:56:33.510 --> 03:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
lose
 
03:56:35.429 --> 03:56:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh investment that some of these
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
students have by taking courses and not
 
03:56:38.710 --> 03:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
having them
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
lead to that four-year degree that
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative ford is talking about
 
03:56:45.349 --> 03:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
in the military they're just looking for
 
03:56:46.950 --> 03:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
that degree
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
you can become an officer
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
my degree was in history it qualified me
 
03:56:54.229 --> 03:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
to enlist and then become an officer by
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
a different path
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
you can do that now
 
03:56:58.319 --> 03:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
you can do that now
that's

03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:57:02.710 --> 03:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
again if you know what you know that's
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
the path you take and you take these
 
03:57:06.790 --> 03:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
courses you'll come in as a junior so if
 
03:57:06.800 --> 03:57:07.429 align:start position:0%
courses you'll come in as a junior so if
i

03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
i want to go into the gen eds and want
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
to go to keene state
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i have the
 
03:57:16.389 --> 03:57:16.399 align:start position:0%
the four-year degree can i enroll in
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
keene state as uh junior in liberal arts
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
i believe so
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
i believe so
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
nursing liberal arts is probably the
 
03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:29.110 align:start position:0%
nursing liberal arts is probably the
easiest

03:57:29.110 --> 03:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
easiest
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
again then if i want to transfer another
 
03:57:33.429 --> 03:57:33.439 align:start position:0%
program then i'm gonna have to you know
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
take all those prerequisites i might
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
graduate as a fifth year student or a
 
03:57:38.950 --> 03:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
six-year student right you look more
 
03:57:40.630 --> 03:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
closely at that applicability which
 
03:57:42.309 --> 03:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
program which courses you know but
 
03:57:46.229 --> 03:57:46.239 align:start position:0%
liberal arts is probably the easiest one
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
i apologize i gotta run
 
03:57:52.630 --> 03:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:55.510 --> 03:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
well my my question here following on
 
03:57:58.790 --> 03:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
rep luno and rep ford is
 
03:58:01.750 --> 03:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that um in a lot of ways
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
the biggest difference between the
 
03:58:05.030 --> 03:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
four-year schools and the community
 
03:58:05.040 --> 03:58:06.469 align:start position:0%
four-year schools and the community
college

03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
college
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
is the delivery method so the community
 
03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:12.399 align:start position:0%
college you're kind of you're local
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
you might be going days or nights
 
03:58:18.710 --> 03:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
you might be you know not even full time
 
03:58:21.030 --> 03:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're usually working a job that kind
 
03:58:22.389 --> 03:58:22.399 align:start position:0%
of thing
 
03:58:24.630 --> 03:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
whereas the university you might go away
 
03:58:24.640 --> 03:58:26.309 align:start position:0%
whereas the university you might go away
too

03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
too
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know i might go to university and
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
either get a dorm or an apartment or
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
whatever and live nearby
 
03:58:32.399 --> 03:58:33.349 align:start position:0%
whatever and live nearby
and

03:58:33.349 --> 03:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
use all of those other facilities the
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
gym and all of that stuff that the
 
03:58:40.710 --> 03:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
community college might not have
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
well if i'm in that situation where i'm
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
working and maybe raising kids or
 
03:58:45.279 --> 03:58:46.389 align:start position:0%
working and maybe raising kids or
whatever

03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
and let's say i've
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
gotten my technical degree so i've done
 
03:58:52.870 --> 03:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
the technical stuff at the community
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
college because that community college
 
03:58:55.750 --> 03:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
offered that
 
03:58:56.830 --> 03:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
could i
 
03:59:00.070 --> 03:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's then what i'm missing is the gen ed
 
03:59:01.590 --> 03:59:01.600 align:start position:0%
courses but then there are community
 
03:59:03.910 --> 03:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
colleges that you get the gen ed courses
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
from so the question
 
03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
to me is
 
03:59:10.830 --> 03:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
it it would seem rather than having to
 
03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
travel to get those gen ed courses at a
 
03:59:14.000 --> 03:59:15.670 align:start position:0%
travel to get those gen ed courses at a
university

03:59:15.670 --> 03:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
university
 
03:59:18.070 --> 03:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
would it not be possible for me to get
 
03:59:18.080 --> 03:59:19.349 align:start position:0%
would it not be possible for me to get
those

03:59:19.349 --> 03:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:59:22.150 --> 03:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
there at the community college that's
 
03:59:24.389 --> 03:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
down the road that i can
 
03:59:27.510 --> 03:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
take my classes you know amongst my work
 
03:59:30.150 --> 03:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
schedule etc and i think
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's my take on on what
 
03:59:35.750 --> 03:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
rep ford was saying is how do you keep
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
the kid the kid
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
the adult usually who can't
 
03:59:43.750 --> 03:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
go off to school
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
who has who has a location that they
 
03:59:47.670 --> 03:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
need to be at
 
03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative lake is
 
04:00:00.550 --> 04:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
if i make
 
04:00:02.469 --> 04:00:02.479 align:start position:0%
a student who wants a bachelor's degree
 
04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
may start with us in a certificate
 
04:00:05.830 --> 04:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
program maybe a purely
 
04:00:08.150 --> 04:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
technical one-year certificate program
 
04:00:10.710 --> 04:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
but that student has access to all of
 
04:00:12.469 --> 04:00:12.479 align:start position:0%
the courses general education
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
prerequisites that would support
 
04:00:16.550 --> 04:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
pursuing a bachelor's degree
 
04:00:16.560 --> 04:00:17.349 align:start position:0%
pursuing a bachelor's degree
so

04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:18.870 --> 04:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
part of what you heard president lloyd
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
described earlier in the partnership
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
with plymouth is figuring out
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
when you've made full use maximal use of
 
04:00:27.510 --> 04:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
what the community college system can
 
04:00:29.910 --> 04:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
offer the affordability the location the
 
04:00:32.469 --> 04:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
convenience maximize all of that before
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
you need to to move for a bachelor's
 
04:00:37.830 --> 04:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
degree depending on what the program is
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
could be as it could be a fully online
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree and you don't have to
 
04:00:41.840 --> 04:00:42.710 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree and you don't have to
move

04:00:42.710 --> 04:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
move
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
it could be that it is a location-based
 
04:00:46.790 --> 04:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
program and you actually do have to do
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
that but again there are ways to
 
04:00:50.469 --> 04:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
maximize what we can do through the
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
community college system supporting the
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
access mission that we have contributing
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
to the affordability of that degree
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
it really depends on the specific
 
04:01:00.550 --> 04:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
program and a lot of it comes down to
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
good advising the articulation
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
agreements map out in general terms that
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
a student who follows this roadmap
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
here's how it will land
 
04:01:10.309 --> 04:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of our students lives haven't lent
 
04:01:12.150 --> 04:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
themselves to a specific roadmap because
 
04:01:14.229 --> 04:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
they've taken pretty circuitous routes
 
04:01:15.910 --> 04:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
at that point really comes down to the
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
personalized advising somebody who can
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
sit down between the two sets of
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
institutions and say this is where you
 
04:01:22.239 --> 04:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
institutions and say this is where you
are

04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
this is a map that can get you
 
04:01:24.479 --> 04:01:26.309 align:start position:0%
this is a map that can get you
specifically

04:01:26.309 --> 04:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
to this location
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's not a cookie cutter it's it's going
 
04:01:32.550 --> 04:01:32.560 align:start position:0%
to be really tailored
 
04:01:32.560 --> 04:01:34.070 align:start position:0%
to be really tailored
so

04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:37.189 --> 04:01:37.199 align:start position:0%
i can understand if you just took gen
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
egg has courses at the
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
community college it whether it's near
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
you might not offer the technical
 
04:01:45.750 --> 04:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
courses that you wanted but if the
 
04:01:48.070 --> 04:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
community college offers the technical
 
04:01:48.080 --> 04:01:49.269 align:start position:0%
community college offers the technical
courses

04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
courses
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
and i think most community colleges
 
04:01:54.150 --> 04:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
offer gen ed courses
 
04:01:56.469 --> 04:01:56.479 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why the community
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
college couldn't then offer the
 
04:01:58.319 --> 04:02:02.070 align:start position:0%
college couldn't then offer the
bachelor's

04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.309 --> 04:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
typically the distinction is going to be
 
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
the major required courses at the upper
 
04:02:06.800 --> 04:02:07.670 align:start position:0%
the major required courses at the upper
level

04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
more advanced courses
 
04:02:11.269 --> 04:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily mean that our
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
faculty are not qualified to do that but
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
our faculty are typically focused on the
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
courses that contribute to the associate
 
04:02:19.590 --> 04:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
degree or the certificates that we have
 
04:02:22.150 --> 04:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
so some of it is a resource question and
 
04:02:24.630 --> 04:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
capacity and some of that is better
 
04:02:26.790 --> 04:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
addressed with collaboration through the
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
university system i i will say that that
 
04:02:31.830 --> 04:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
some of this is still
 
04:02:33.429 --> 04:02:33.439 align:start position:0%
about location
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
and as you described earlier the
 
04:02:36.309 --> 04:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
experience for a lot of our students who
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
are working adults as opposed to a
 
04:02:39.670 --> 04:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
full-time student who immerses
 
04:02:41.510 --> 04:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
themselves in a particular campus at a
 
04:02:43.590 --> 04:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
location away from home our students
 
04:02:45.510 --> 04:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
have lives with families and jobs and
 
04:02:47.429 --> 04:02:47.439 align:start position:0%
other things so it's one course at a
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
time and the ability to conveniently do
 
04:02:52.469 --> 04:02:52.479 align:start position:0%
that you know again as opposed to having
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
04:02:56.790 --> 04:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
an efficient way to do that for that one
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
particular student at our location
 
04:03:01.110 --> 04:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know that that's why those two
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
students with the diesel uh mechanic
 
04:03:07.349 --> 04:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
technology program went to cobbleskill
 
04:03:09.189 --> 04:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
because that was just a more efficient
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
way for us to do that we can't afford
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
the luxury of that that specific
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
customization i was thinking i was
 
04:03:19.030 --> 04:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
thinking partly rn for i mean an rn
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
two-year program versus an rn four-year
 
04:03:21.120 --> 04:03:22.309 align:start position:0%
two-year program versus an rn four-year
program

04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:03:22.319 --> 04:03:23.349 align:start position:0%
program
and

04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
i keep asking what's the difference and
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
i get told it's the gen ed courses
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
and since some community colleges are
 
04:03:30.560 --> 04:03:31.670 align:start position:0%
and since some community colleges are
offering

04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
offering
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
rns could they not then
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
allow the students as they have time to
 
04:03:38.870 --> 04:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
take those gen egg courses
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
and give the four-year bachelor's i mean
 
04:03:41.279 --> 04:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
and give the four-year bachelor's i mean
that's

04:03:44.630 --> 04:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
well i'll always say it's a little bit
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
more than the general education courses
 
04:03:51.269 --> 04:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
our students after two years are
 
04:03:54.070 --> 04:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
qualified to pursue the nclex the the
 
04:03:56.550 --> 04:03:56.560 align:start position:0%
licensure exam for nurses they become
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
working nurses they are in the field and
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
contributing to the state's health care
 
04:04:02.469 --> 04:04:02.479 align:start position:0%
workforce that bachelor's degree is two
 
04:04:04.389 --> 04:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
additional years it includes additional
 
04:04:06.550 --> 04:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
coursework in the program in the in
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
nursing as well as additional uh courses
 
04:04:10.710 --> 04:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
in general education as well as
 
04:04:12.950 --> 04:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
additional clinical experience so it's
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
not it's not quite as as easy as
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
additional general education courses
 
04:04:18.830 --> 04:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
again it would require an expansion of
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
capacity but that was the reason why the
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
community college system the university
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
system partnered
 
04:04:26.710 --> 04:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
nine years ago to create the rn to bsn
 
04:04:30.070 --> 04:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
program increase access affordability
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
allowing students to maintain the
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
community college system tuition rate
 
04:04:34.950 --> 04:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
all the way through four years and and
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
kept them with the community college
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
system for three of those four years to
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
facilitate an easier transition
 
04:04:43.189 --> 04:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome mr sub
 
04:04:46.550 --> 04:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee chair can i ask you a question
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
may i ask you a question please do
 
04:04:50.469 --> 04:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh when you out of the room president
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
lloyd explained that in berlin at white
 
04:04:54.389 --> 04:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
mountains they currently have the
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
capacity or the capability to support a
 
04:04:59.110 --> 04:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
student getting satisfying all
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate requirements without ever
 
04:05:03.269 --> 04:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
leaving berlin presumably through the
 
04:05:05.110 --> 04:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
plymouth connection so my question for
 
04:05:07.830 --> 04:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
you is uh i'm not sure if you if you
 
04:05:08.790 --> 04:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
knew that
 
04:05:10.469 --> 04:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
yes i did okay
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
so my question viewers
 
04:05:12.080 --> 04:05:13.349 align:start position:0%
so my question viewers
um

04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:13.359 --> 04:05:14.469 align:start position:0%
um
that

04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:05:17.670 --> 04:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
presumably does not satisfy your intent
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
is it correct say your intent is is to
 
04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
have what's happening in berlin
 
04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh ultimately be a berlin or white
 
04:05:26.790 --> 04:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
mountains degree as opposed to a
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
plymouth degree is that where
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
was not any particular solution
 
04:05:36.309 --> 04:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
my objective in proposing this
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
was to increase access to education for
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
all of these groups we've been talking
 
04:05:41.760 --> 04:05:42.710 align:start position:0%
all of these groups we've been talking
about

04:05:42.710 --> 04:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
that was my primary purpose underlying
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
the mechanism toward which i
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
attempted to get us to discuss this
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
issue that we're talking about now this
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
very discussion
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
was to advocate that the community
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
colleges which already have the
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
authority to start a bachelor's program
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
but according i have letters here from
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
susan eward and others who said there
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
was a difficulty in the system in
 
04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
getting agreement about how to deliver
 
04:06:13.590 --> 04:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
that whether that was a mechanism and
 
04:06:15.590 --> 04:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
that some people in the university board
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
advocated only doing it through the
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
university system they had a different
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
mindset on the issue
 
04:06:23.910 --> 04:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
and so the bill to bring in the
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
community college was intended to have
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
to create this opportunity we are now
 
04:06:29.760 --> 04:06:31.110 align:start position:0%
to create this opportunity we are now
experiencing

04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
to introduce the idea among serious
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
people with serious under experience and
 
04:06:36.000 --> 04:06:37.590 align:start position:0%
people with serious under experience and
understanding

04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there something we need to change in
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
how we're doing this
 
04:06:45.189 --> 04:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
what can we as a legislature do to
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
facilitate that process to make it
 
04:06:48.319 --> 04:06:49.670 align:start position:0%
facilitate that process to make it
happen

04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:06:52.070 --> 04:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
need does it need funding here or
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
something there is there is there some
 
04:06:58.070 --> 04:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
kind of mechanism that provides the
 
04:07:01.110 --> 04:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
leverage that gets us from the condition
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
that you two were just talking about
 
04:07:05.269 --> 04:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
into implementation
 
04:07:07.269 --> 04:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
how to now having taught at two
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
different community college systems i
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
was at mass bay community college was my
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
first job in new england
 
04:07:18.550 --> 04:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
i know that the difference in part is in
 
04:07:20.830 --> 04:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
these community colleges are
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
student-centered universities quite
 
04:07:25.269 --> 04:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
frankly are discipline centered
 
04:07:27.269 --> 04:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
so there's a little turf fight whenever
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
you have gen ed oh our course has to be
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
in gen ed that always that's a reality
 
04:07:34.389 --> 04:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
we all understand that
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
but it can get in the way
 
04:07:39.189 --> 04:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
and so what i'm asking you to do is
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
think about then think is there
 
04:07:43.110 --> 04:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
something maybe that we should be doing
 
04:07:46.070 --> 04:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
to get rid of the turf part of it
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
to get rid of that and said what's the
 
04:07:49.750 --> 04:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
objective if the objective is to get
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
these people education how do we do that
 
04:07:54.630 --> 04:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
because people who want to sit on the
 
04:07:57.110 --> 04:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
mission statement is the reason for
 
04:08:00.229 --> 04:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it or doing it
 
04:08:01.830 --> 04:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to take off move off that
 
04:08:01.840 --> 04:08:02.790 align:start position:0%
don't want to take off move off that
down

04:08:02.790 --> 04:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:08:04.950 --> 04:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
that was plainly evident in the hearing
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
they held to which for me
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
to explain why the system couldn't do it
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it because no one asked
 
04:08:14.000 --> 04:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do it because no one asked
them

04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:08:17.110 --> 04:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
now think about that think about that
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
for just a minute
 
04:08:21.269 --> 04:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
if you're looking for an
 
04:08:23.030 --> 04:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
academic driven
 
04:08:23.040 --> 04:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
academic driven
uh

04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:08:27.510 --> 04:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
economic development in the state
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
are you going to expect the people who
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
are least prepared
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
have leased education to come to you
 
04:08:35.990 --> 04:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
with a concise statement of exactly what
 
04:08:38.229 --> 04:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
they need to move the economy in new
 
04:08:38.239 --> 04:08:39.590 align:start position:0%
they need to move the economy in new
hampshire

04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're not dealing with a factory where
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
they train people to produce widgets
 
04:08:46.229 --> 04:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with a world in which
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
exactly these badges you're talking
 
04:08:48.239 --> 04:08:49.510 align:start position:0%
exactly these badges you're talking
about

04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
make the people who are the
 
04:08:52.950 --> 04:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote workers
 
04:08:56.149 --> 04:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
into at least mid-managers and it's only
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
after that as they get involved in the
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
mix of blending management and work in
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
community college of through community
 
04:09:07.349 --> 04:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
college educated people now the workers
 
04:09:10.149 --> 04:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
are mid-managers at least
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
because they're working to produce
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
software mechanisms that both are the
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism and the device in the end when
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
they finish
 
04:09:20.710 --> 04:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
the created object
 
04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i'm inviting this
 
04:09:23.120 --> 04:09:24.550 align:start position:0%
and so that's why i'm inviting this
discussion

04:09:24.550 --> 04:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
and and doing and using this to have it
 
04:09:29.590 --> 04:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
is because it's hard for discipline
 
04:09:32.309 --> 04:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
centered people to talk about giving up
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
something they think
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
secures their job
 
04:09:38.710 --> 04:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's a psychological thing
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
you don't ask somebody say gee why don't
 
04:09:42.229 --> 04:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
we get something that does your job
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
better and then we won't need you that's
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
how their brain works
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
works but with me too
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so the the proposal for proposing
 
04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees was a dramatic
 
04:09:57.750 --> 04:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
decisive decision that would force the
 
04:09:57.760 --> 04:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
decisive decision that would force the
issue

04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:10:01.110 --> 04:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
or at least force the discussion
 
04:10:03.269 --> 04:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
so what we're having here is my
 
04:10:03.279 --> 04:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
so what we're having here is my
objective

04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
objective
 
04:10:06.790 --> 04:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
mr subcommittee
 
04:10:09.510 --> 04:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
chair follow up if i may oh please
 
04:10:12.070 --> 04:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh first i want to note that typically
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
for upper level courses for a
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate degree you would have uh
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
folks with masters or or phds teaching
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
the upper level courses that that's an
 
04:10:21.359 --> 04:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
the upper level courses that that's an
issue

04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:10:24.630 --> 04:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh that maybe we can come back to my my
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh i just want to clarify i
 
04:10:28.630 --> 04:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
brought this up earlier when you were in
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
the other committee room
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
the the language in 1530 specifically
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
refers to a bachelor's degree not
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
offered or available at any
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
institution university system so your
 
04:10:41.600 --> 04:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
institution university system so your
intent

04:10:42.630 --> 04:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
intent
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
is to show that it was possible that
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
there were things not covered
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
by the structure we had
 
04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
now i'm i'm sensing that some folks on
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
the university system side might be
 
04:10:56.550 --> 04:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
nervous or uncomfortable
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
thinking that if this were to move
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
forward that
 
04:10:59.520 --> 04:11:01.030 align:start position:0%
forward that
that

04:11:01.030 --> 04:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
community colleges who pursued a
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate option might
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
offer degrees or want to offer degrees
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
that are
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
already offered by the university system
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
so could you clarify that i think that's
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
a understandable concern on the
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
university side
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
but the language specifically seems to
 
04:11:20.239 --> 04:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
but the language specifically seems to
say

04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
that it is for some program not offered
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
is it is that your intent
 
04:11:29.910 --> 04:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
my intent in selecting that example was
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
to show that there were things that the
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
university system will likely never
 
04:11:34.560 --> 04:11:35.590 align:start position:0%
university system will likely never
offer

04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
offer
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
for exactly the reasons that were
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
explained here they're expensive they
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
require a lot of equipment they don't
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
have anybody who teaches that they don't
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
have that expertise
 
04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
now if they want to then go and get a
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
degree in
 
04:11:53.110 --> 04:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
mechanics or in
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
economics or business or some
 
04:11:57.189 --> 04:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
application of business that's fine but
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
that's add-on
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's not management of
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
whatever hydraulic systems etc etc what
 
04:12:08.630 --> 04:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
i was envisioning was the degree that
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
would build management on top of that's
 
04:12:13.269 --> 04:12:13.279 align:start position:0%
just an example of just
 
04:12:15.269 --> 04:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
picking ideas out of the air
 
04:12:16.870 --> 04:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
management a degree that would offer
 
04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
somebody a bachelor's degree and not
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
only just a repair of something but the
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
whole management and down the train of
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
supply that we all hear about now and
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
all throughout that so that they would
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
have an option that was bigger than
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.830 --> 04:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
because if they were going to grow into
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
something bigger than that their
 
04:12:39.030 --> 04:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
business interests were going to grow
 
04:12:41.429 --> 04:12:41.439 align:start position:0%
into managing your own business i grew
 
04:12:44.790 --> 04:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
up in an advertising firm i was writing
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
it was that kind of thing where the job
 
04:12:53.269 --> 04:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
grows and you grow with it
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
and so that's what i'm envisioning you
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
go in the military and suddenly you're
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
in motor transport and they want you to
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
be the officer and you don't know beans
 
04:13:02.790 --> 04:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:13:04.389 --> 04:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
who would have been better
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why i thought about oh that's
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
a way of but they talk about it is we
 
04:13:15.510 --> 04:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to produce jobs for new hampshire
 
04:13:18.309 --> 04:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
wait a minute how about for people who
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
live in new hampshire
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's just like the people who say
 
04:13:24.630 --> 04:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
science says science doesn't say
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything scientists say something
 
04:13:31.590 --> 04:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's the people
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
and my focus is exactly on that
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
helping those people bridge a gap they
 
04:13:40.870 --> 04:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.389 --> 04:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
does that get at your questions or
 
04:13:42.399 --> 04:13:44.149 align:start position:0%
does that get at your questions or
representative

04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you that that that's very
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you
 
04:13:49.510 --> 04:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
i'd like just to read you one statement
 
04:13:51.439 --> 04:13:52.389 align:start position:0%
i'd like just to read you one statement
here

04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
so you know that i didn't come into this
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
out of thin air
 
04:13:58.149 --> 04:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
i've been talking with susan heward for
 
04:14:00.790 --> 04:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
a very long time and after her
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
with chancellor here with us
 
04:14:05.670 --> 04:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
susan wrote to me
 
04:14:08.309 --> 04:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
after referencing my wife with whom she
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
used to work
 
04:14:09.520 --> 04:14:14.710 align:start position:0%
used to work
at

04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:16.149 --> 04:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
where the heck was i'm trying to say it
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
now my mind went blank but anyway in the
 
04:14:21.510 --> 04:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
state college system
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to think about this
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill given the current ticklish
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
situation we have with the merger convic
 
04:14:30.630 --> 04:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
conversation still being very active
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
as a system we have had this discussion
 
04:14:35.189 --> 04:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
a number of times given there are at
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
least 19 states that permit community
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
colleges to be offered applied
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate degrees such as those you
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
has floated the idea of some specific
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degrees because there are no
 
04:14:59.110 --> 04:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
completion programs in the state for
 
04:15:02.309 --> 04:15:02.319 align:start position:0%
dental hygiene and radiology you will
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
not be surprised to hear there was
 
04:15:06.870 --> 04:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
substantial pushback from the university
 
04:15:09.510 --> 04:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
system and no i was not surprised that's
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what happened in minnesota when
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
i was there i was a university president
 
04:15:14.399 --> 04:15:15.189 align:start position:0%
i was there i was a university president
there

04:15:15.189 --> 04:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
but the issues were the same
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then may i arrange a phone call we
 
04:15:21.510 --> 04:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'd love to talk further about this with
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
you etc etc
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
this is not a new issue
 
04:15:29.750 --> 04:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's just it's hard to get people to
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it because it means
 
04:15:31.359 --> 04:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
want to talk about it because it means
change

04:15:33.030 --> 04:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.269 --> 04:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
universities have people teaching
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
courses who don't have doctorates too
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:45.990 --> 04:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
and in some disciplines it's almost a
 
04:15:47.990 --> 04:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
given particularly some of the technical
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
and finance things
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
those are taught by people with master's
 
04:15:51.760 --> 04:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
those are taught by people with master's
degrees

04:15:53.030 --> 04:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
degrees
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
even in universities
 
04:15:57.189 --> 04:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
because that's where the specialization
 
04:15:57.199 --> 04:15:58.389 align:start position:0%
because that's where the specialization
is

04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:16:00.790 --> 04:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get out of this this is
 
04:16:00.800 --> 04:16:02.070 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to get out of this this is
turf

04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
turf
 
04:16:03.830 --> 04:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
i hate that word
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
it means you stop thinking before you
 
04:16:05.600 --> 04:16:06.630 align:start position:0%
it means you stop thinking before you
start

04:16:06.630 --> 04:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
start
 
04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
articulating the problem
 
04:16:12.149 --> 04:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
that's why i said no no let's we're all
 
04:16:14.630 --> 04:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
people here who value education in this
 
04:16:14.640 --> 04:16:16.630 align:start position:0%
people here who value education in this
room

04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:16:18.550 --> 04:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
some of us have more degrees than the
 
04:16:20.149 --> 04:16:20.159 align:start position:0%
others but you know after a while that
 
04:16:23.110 --> 04:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
degree stuff gets to be
 
04:16:23.120 --> 04:16:28.710 align:start position:0%
degree stuff gets to be
cumbersome

04:16:28.710 --> 04:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
when i
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
wanted when i presented this bill and i
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
believe representative you made the
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
comment if i'm not mistaken what are you
 
04:16:41.110 --> 04:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
saying about this bill or something to
 
04:16:44.229 --> 04:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
that effect and i had to explain
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is a mechanism to look at
 
04:16:51.110 --> 04:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire educational
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity equity act as much as i hate
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
that word equity
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
and i go right right into talking about
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
white mountain community college that's
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.469 --> 04:17:06.479 align:start position:0%
there are people who
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
generally in in new hampshire people are
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
geographically disadvantaged
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
they can't get there from where they are
 
04:17:17.830 --> 04:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
or there's no model on the hill near
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
their house to say come to the
 
04:17:22.630 --> 04:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
university on hill
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
what they need is somebody with a
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
handout and a hand up
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm saying is the role
 
04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
it was argued if chancellor please
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm mistaken on this but
 
04:17:35.189 --> 04:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
it was argued within the in the bill
 
04:17:37.750 --> 04:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
that presented to me that
 
04:17:39.110 --> 04:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
04:17:41.590 --> 04:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
we expect the communities to tell us
 
04:17:44.070 --> 04:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
specifically what their needs are for a
 
04:17:45.910 --> 04:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
particular business
 
04:17:47.590 --> 04:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
tell us what kind of people you want us
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
to train
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
they may not even know
 
04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
i spoke with a woman with a doctorate
 
04:17:56.550 --> 04:17:56.560 align:start position:0%
and nursing really recently and she told
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
me nursing degrees are easier to obtain
 
04:18:01.750 --> 04:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
in the commercial market than they are
 
04:18:03.910 --> 04:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
in the educational market
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
my next door neighbor told me that he
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
got his job he's a marine gunnery
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
sergeant and we're talking shop over the
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
over the back fence and he said oh my
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
degree didn't my bachelor associates
 
04:18:18.149 --> 04:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
degree didn't account for anything it's
 
04:18:20.870 --> 04:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
the badges i had that got me the job
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
and they kept keep me employed i said
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're losing out if we make ourselves
 
04:18:26.880 --> 04:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
we're losing out if we make ourselves
inconsequential

04:18:29.110 --> 04:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
inconsequential
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
we pretty soon don't exist at all
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the role of the community college will
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
disappear because people think
 
04:18:38.149 --> 04:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
they don't have anything to add to my
 
04:18:41.510 --> 04:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
value to my marketability
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm saying we need to look to
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
the marketability yeah i grew up in
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
advertising i know marketing and i took
 
04:18:49.590 --> 04:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
a business degree
 
04:18:51.910 --> 04:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm an english major
 
04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.070 --> 04:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
whereas in ford uh you mentioned
 
04:19:01.590 --> 04:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
specifically radiology or radiography
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
that was susan
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
okay oh that's from her okay sort of
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
mention uh to you
 
04:19:08.950 --> 04:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
um maybe chancellor rubenstein or
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
someone someone would know the answer to
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
this i'm i'm curious
 
04:19:14.790 --> 04:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
about that specific field of radiography
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
or radiology
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
if there is no
 
04:19:18.159 --> 04:19:20.070 align:start position:0%
if there is no
radiology

04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
radiology
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
baccalaureate opportunity anywhere in
 
04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
the state at this time i i don't know do
 
04:19:27.750 --> 04:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
other states have baccalaureate degrees
 
04:19:27.760 --> 04:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
other states have baccalaureate degrees
in

04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:19:31.510 --> 04:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
radiology representative there a handful
 
04:19:33.510 --> 04:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
of programs out there
 
04:19:33.520 --> 04:19:34.790 align:start position:0%
of programs out there
when

04:19:34.790 --> 04:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:19:37.189 --> 04:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
former chancellor heward had raised that
 
04:19:39.110 --> 04:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue we did actually look and as
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
president lloyd described one of the
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
first things we did was to try and find
 
04:19:43.990 --> 04:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
out if there was employment demand that
 
04:19:46.229 --> 04:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
would justify the degree doesn't mean a
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
student isn't interested in a bachelor's
 
04:19:48.080 --> 04:19:49.030 align:start position:0%
student isn't interested in a bachelor's
degree

04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
degree
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't find a specific
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
employment market demand that would
 
04:19:55.510 --> 04:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
justify the expense that would be
 
04:19:58.070 --> 04:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
incurred at the time conversations did
 
04:20:00.710 --> 04:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
ensue with the presidents of the usnh
 
04:20:02.229 --> 04:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
institutions to see if any had an
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
interest in incurring the expense of
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
introducing those programs
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
no appetite for that but again the the
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
real issue is we couldn't find a a
 
04:20:12.630 --> 04:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
benefit to students for offering that
 
04:20:14.309 --> 04:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
program there are a handful of those
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
programs including dental hygiene that
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
lead to a bachelor's degree but but not
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
enough around the country to suggest a a
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
real market for it
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
thank you so it sounds like you've
 
04:20:27.349 --> 04:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
already looked at that and uh okay
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
did again as president lloyd described
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
the starting point for this is it
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
valuable to students to employers value
 
04:20:35.429 --> 04:20:35.439 align:start position:0%
will will it actually help somebody in
 
04:20:37.590 --> 04:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
in delivering better care the the
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in nursing
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
the data support a better educated
 
04:20:44.389 --> 04:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
workforce of nurses producing better
 
04:20:46.149 --> 04:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
health care outcomes we couldn't find
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
similar compelling information
 
04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the bachelor's degree for the
 
04:20:51.910 --> 04:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
other two programs
 
04:20:53.429 --> 04:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
sure you mentioned nursing i
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
specifically didn't i mentioned radio
 
04:20:57.670 --> 04:20:57.680 align:start position:0%
radiology as opposed to nursing nursing
 
04:20:58.790 --> 04:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
being a
 
04:21:00.630 --> 04:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
plymouth as nursing now
 
04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
so that would be clearly an area where
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
ccs and aids would conflict would
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
compete with u.s nh and so that that's
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
why i would not look at nursing i would
 
04:21:13.030 --> 04:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
look at something like radiology which
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
you've already looked at it sounds like
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
but we of course offer nursing at all
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
seven of our colleges and and prepare in
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
a given year more than 200 nurses
 
04:21:23.910 --> 04:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
entering new hampshire's workforce those
 
04:21:25.590 --> 04:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
are students who will then typically go
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
on to complete a bachelor's degree some
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
point later in their careers but but we
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
offer the foundation for more than 200
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
some years as many as 230 or 250
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire nurses
 
04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ford um you
 
04:21:46.640 --> 04:21:47.429 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ford um you
know

04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
you you brought it up when you were um
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
when you were talking and and um
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
and catherine brought it up to the uh
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
the idea of credentials these stackable
 
04:21:56.960 --> 04:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
the idea of credentials these stackable
credentials

04:21:58.389 --> 04:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
04:22:00.710 --> 04:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i i certainly i don't profess to
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
know a whole lot um about them other
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
than sort of anecdotally you know in my
 
04:22:09.349 --> 04:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
experience um
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
of back in the day when i was uh running
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
a a
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
tech company
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
and um where where it was really clear
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
when we were looking to uh to hire
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
people you know we're looking for very
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
very specific skills
 
04:22:24.479 --> 04:22:25.429 align:start position:0%
very specific skills
and

04:22:25.429 --> 04:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
not necessarily
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
all the skills one would need to uh to
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
to become competent in in order to get
 
04:22:36.309 --> 04:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
either a two-year or four-year degree
 
04:22:38.070 --> 04:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
but a specific set of skills that you
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
might be able to
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a credential in after taking i
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't know let's say three or four
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
very specific classes and um
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
and you know i've been out of industry
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
now for uh for a handful of years so so
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
some of this has probably proceeded
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um you know to uh you know beyond where
 
04:23:00.469 --> 04:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
where where my familiarity uh was with
 
04:23:03.830 --> 04:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
it but um i'm getting i sort of get the
 
04:23:05.429 --> 04:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
sense from
 
04:23:07.830 --> 04:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
from you know advisory board meetings
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
and talking with others in industry that
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous growth in interest
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
not so much in uh in degree completion
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
but in um in these credentials that
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
build on on each other and um and
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
do they lead to a degree they might they
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
04:23:29.590 --> 04:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
you know do the do they take
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
five years or six years or four years of
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
continuous study in order to
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
get to a
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
degree attainment um
 
04:23:40.640 --> 04:23:43.269 align:start position:0%
degree attainment um
um

04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:23:47.429 --> 04:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe longer maybe never
 
04:23:50.550 --> 04:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but the the value to the to the
 
04:23:50.560 --> 04:23:51.830 align:start position:0%
um but the the value to the to the
employee

04:23:51.830 --> 04:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh or the value to the student as being
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
an employee and a value to the employer
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
who may be very willing to um to you
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
know pay the
 
04:24:03.110 --> 04:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
tuition costs for somebody to take three
 
04:24:05.030 --> 04:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
classes and get the python credential or
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
whatever it happens to be
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
um i think is um is is really where
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
where where there there appears to be
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of demand or growing demand
 
04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking that question and i
 
04:24:25.030 --> 04:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
mean that quite so it's just a comment
 
04:24:29.670 --> 04:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:29.680 --> 04:24:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

04:24:31.510 --> 04:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:24:33.830 --> 04:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
there is a question in it because we
 
04:24:35.910 --> 04:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
have to ask ourselves why would an
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
employer want to employ someone who is
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
always for the rest of his life going to
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
remain at the same level
 
04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
because that's what you're talking about
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
you know by basically entry level
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
application level that person who's
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
going to stand at the i'll use the
 
04:24:54.070 --> 04:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
figurative lathe
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
and work producing widgets
 
04:24:58.550 --> 04:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be a good legit producer no
 
04:25:00.550 --> 04:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
question and valuable is that kind of an
 
04:25:00.560 --> 04:25:01.830 align:start position:0%
question and valuable is that kind of an
employee

04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:25:04.469 --> 04:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
but in an era in which one is likely to
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
move to becoming a supervisor
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
and then maybe even a manager all in the
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
same career time i would say that we're
 
04:25:15.830 --> 04:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
doing them a disservice if we give them
 
04:25:18.790 --> 04:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
half an education
 
04:25:20.870 --> 04:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
we should give them we should sell them
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
an education an education that allows
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
them to expand with that education into
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the roles that will be expected of them
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
as their career proceeds
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so i i don't want to use a majority
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
place like dead end but a career
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
stopping education that says you can
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
only go this far no farther
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to avoid that and can tell
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
talk to them about you're educating
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
yourself for a career not for a job
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
right now you need a job you need
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
incoming you need to feed somebody
 
04:25:53.840 --> 04:25:55.030 align:start position:0%
incoming you need to feed somebody
whatever

04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
but after that
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's a life
 
04:26:01.189 --> 04:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking about educating them
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
toward an ambition toward an
 
04:26:05.110 --> 04:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that their role will
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
increasingly become more and more
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
complex for which they need education
 
04:26:11.910 --> 04:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why as i keep telling my
 
04:26:11.920 --> 04:26:12.950 align:start position:0%
and that's why as i keep telling my
neighbor

04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
neighbor
 
04:26:14.630 --> 04:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
said the bachelor's degree i mean
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
associated he did not get you the job
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
the badges got you the job
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
what about the next job
 
04:26:23.429 --> 04:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
and that's the argument and he's my
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
neighbor he's also an ex-marine so you
 
04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:26.550 align:start position:0%
neighbor he's also an ex-marine so you
know

04:26:26.550 --> 04:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
how that goes
 
04:26:29.590 --> 04:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative if i might respond to
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative fluno's question
 
04:26:34.399 --> 04:26:35.269 align:start position:0%
representative fluno's question
that

04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:35.279 --> 04:26:36.710 align:start position:0%
that
education

04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
is what we do
 
04:26:39.910 --> 04:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
both systems
 
04:26:42.790 --> 04:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
how it's recorded has been changing
 
04:26:45.030 --> 04:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
what used to be just degrees incl
 
04:26:47.429 --> 04:26:47.439 align:start position:0%
increasingly includes certificates
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
increasingly includes badges and other
 
04:26:51.349 --> 04:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of micro credentials but they're
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
not separate paths they're they're in
 
04:26:54.630 --> 04:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
fact embedded
 
04:26:56.229 --> 04:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
a student who completes a course
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
typically we say if you successfully
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
complete this course you'll understand
 
04:27:01.110 --> 04:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
these things and you'll be able to do
 
04:27:03.590 --> 04:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
these things well sometimes the ability
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
to understand do those things represents
 
04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
what the badge is so that a student's
 
04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
not just receiving a transcript with a
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
course name and a grade on it but is
 
04:27:13.030 --> 04:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
actually receiving that credential that
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
an employer in an industry whether it's
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
novel network certification or whether
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's advanced care in an area of nursing
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that an employer can recognize the
 
04:27:23.750 --> 04:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
specific competencies that are
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
associated with that but these things
 
04:27:27.590 --> 04:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
are all stackable in the sense that that
 
04:27:29.429 --> 04:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
they're integrated student may
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
accumulate credits toward a degree
 
04:27:33.110 --> 04:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
satisfied degree requirements but also
 
04:27:35.830 --> 04:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
has this other set of credentials along
 
04:27:38.309 --> 04:27:38.319 align:start position:0%
the way in some cases those badges or
 
04:27:40.229 --> 04:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
micro credentials may be standalone but
 
04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
you put enough of them together
 
04:27:43.830 --> 04:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
stackably they suddenly contribute
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
credits toward the degree so again
 
04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
they're intended to be different
 
04:27:49.269 --> 04:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
approaches for education to be delivered
 
04:27:51.510 --> 04:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
and cap and captured and reflected on
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
transcripts that eventually have
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
portability and value for students
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
beyond just a particular job or a
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
representing be perfectly clear
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
um i understand president obama's bill
 
04:28:12.950 --> 04:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
and your response
 
04:28:15.429 --> 04:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
but i understand his request
 
04:28:19.349 --> 04:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
for allowing baccalaureate degrees to be
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
obtained at a community college
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
your dialogue this afternoon is
 
04:28:25.590 --> 04:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
indicated that currently is the stature
 
04:28:29.110 --> 04:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
in a lobble if there is a need
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
i i i want to be very cautious and
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
although representative ladd is no
 
04:28:34.630 --> 04:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
longer here i want to be very respectful
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that i don't assume what the
 
04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislature enables us to do as
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
currently written
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written it says that
 
04:28:44.630 --> 04:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
we are authorized to award the degrees
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
that are common for two-year
 
04:28:48.790 --> 04:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
institutions and increasingly that has
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
become the case that bachelor's degrees
 
04:28:53.429 --> 04:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
as we've heard earlier are are becoming
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
more the norm across the country
 
04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's not our assumption that we can do
 
04:28:59.349 --> 04:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
that without coming back here and our
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
interest in coming back here would only
 
04:29:03.269 --> 04:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
be based on if we felt there was a need
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
for it
 
04:29:07.110 --> 04:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
please thank you so
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and that was my point so in in
 
04:29:09.520 --> 04:29:10.630 align:start position:0%
thank you and that was my point so in in
reality

04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
reality
 
04:29:10.640 --> 04:29:11.750 align:start position:0%
reality
um

04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:11.760 --> 04:29:12.710 align:start position:0%
um
this

04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
request in this bill
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
has been satisfied
 
04:29:19.510 --> 04:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh as we stand here today already
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that the delineation of specific
 
04:29:25.030 --> 04:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
individual degrees are only uh generated
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
if there is a significant
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
amount of student enrollment and
 
04:29:28.880 --> 04:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
amount of student enrollment and
interest

04:29:30.149 --> 04:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
interest
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
and i understand that and i understand
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
representative ford's philosophy you
 
04:29:37.030 --> 04:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
need more than just specificity of a
 
04:29:38.389 --> 04:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
piece but i also understand some people
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
are very happy with that and that's
 
04:29:41.910 --> 04:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
where they want to be um but beyond that
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bill
 
04:29:45.429 --> 04:29:45.439 align:start position:0%
you've met that
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh very much
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you over there and thank you for
 
04:29:51.510 --> 04:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
making specific what what i was trying
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
to explain in that first meeting when
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
you asked me the question about what are
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
you asking for or something of that
 
04:29:59.189 --> 04:29:59.199 align:start position:0%
effect and uh
 
04:30:00.950 --> 04:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
what i would like
 
04:30:03.510 --> 04:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
this to result in is
 
04:30:06.070 --> 04:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
are there changes that we should use my
 
04:30:06.080 --> 04:30:07.349 align:start position:0%
are there changes that we should use my
bill

04:30:07.349 --> 04:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
that you think
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
need to be made that would help you
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
accomplish your various missions and
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's the input i'm seeking the
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
bill sits right now just
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
waiting to be either pigeonholed or are
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
reformed and resubmitted
 
04:30:27.189 --> 04:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
but i'm asking for your input and your
 
04:30:31.189 --> 04:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
guidance on how we can better address
 
04:30:31.199 --> 04:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
guidance on how we can better address
access

04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
access
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
to a college education of all degree
 
04:30:36.000 --> 04:30:39.110 align:start position:0%
to a college education of all degree
levels

04:30:39.110 --> 04:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to talk to workers in the
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
future who tell me their associate's
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
degree has nothing to do with their
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
success in life
 
04:30:51.429 --> 04:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
i come from a family that did not have
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
college education educations educations
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
were the way up
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
that's where my mindset is
 
04:31:05.110 --> 04:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
so i want that education to be one that
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
meets its
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
expectations or meets our expectations
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
as citizens that's my goal and i don't
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
really care how it happens if it happens
 
04:31:16.550 --> 04:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
in agreement and compliance by offering
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
a standalone program
 
04:31:20.070 --> 04:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't really care
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the point
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
the point is access
 
04:31:27.349 --> 04:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm seeking anyone else
 
04:31:30.070 --> 04:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm done i just want to say i think
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
we're we're already
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
doing much of
 
04:31:33.840 --> 04:31:35.990 align:start position:0%
doing much of
um

04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about well i quite
 
04:31:39.910 --> 04:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
agree i didn't know some of it and yes
 
04:31:42.149 --> 04:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
it's been educational for me very much
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:31:45.269 --> 04:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know that that
 
04:31:49.590 --> 04:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
we need any statutory change to continue
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
the collaboration and build upon
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
the partnerships that we have i mean
 
04:31:56.070 --> 04:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
maybe mark and i can think about that
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that we need statutory
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
change to
 
04:32:01.830 --> 04:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
i guess maybe i didn't phrase that
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
correctly what i want you
 
04:32:06.550 --> 04:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
want very much for you to do this is not
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
a mandate it's a question it's really a
 
04:32:08.640 --> 04:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
a mandate it's a question it's really a
hope

04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
hope
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh is that that collaboration will
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be explored and should you
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
require something that makes that
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
possible i think the example i gave was
 
04:32:22.550 --> 04:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
paris who can't afford education you
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
can't afford health care is there a
 
04:32:27.189 --> 04:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism we need to help create or
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
within the system
 
04:32:31.110 --> 04:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
could that be done by the school systems
 
04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
in some way i don't know these are naive
 
04:32:35.110 --> 04:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
questions i'm asking i don't know the
 
04:32:35.120 --> 04:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
questions i'm asking i don't know the
answer

04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:32:38.950 --> 04:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so maybe that's something maybe the
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
student we're trying to address the
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
needs of now needs something different
 
04:32:45.670 --> 04:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
than they needed in 1950 when the
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
community college system was
 
04:32:49.670 --> 04:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
was created
 
04:32:51.030 --> 04:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm just thinking we need to
 
04:32:53.510 --> 04:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
continue to explore what are our
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
objectives and how best can we meet them
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm inviting
 
04:33:01.189 --> 04:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
and hoping for
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
does that answer your yeah i'm not into
 
04:33:06.390 --> 04:33:06.400 align:start position:0%
hammering down this has to do produce
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
this degree
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the point that was the way to
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
and if you say there's nothing we need
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
right now i'd just leave it right there
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
in the folder
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
but if there is some it's there and
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
ready and i'm offering
 
04:33:23.119 --> 04:33:24.709 align:start position:0%
ready and i'm offering
us

04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
us
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
because i know my my colleagues are
 
04:33:28.869 --> 04:33:28.879 align:start position:0%
equally willing they're interested in
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
the same kinds of goals
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
but that if that if that meets the thing
 
04:33:36.390 --> 04:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
we can end this meeting right now hold
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
on before you do before you go there
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
oliver okay
 
04:33:39.279 --> 04:33:40.230 align:start position:0%
oliver okay
so

04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:40.240 --> 04:33:40.949 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
are there specific things
 
04:33:45.029 --> 04:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
that the subcommittee would
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
i think were scheduled for another
 
04:33:46.719 --> 04:33:49.429 align:start position:0%
i think were scheduled for another
meeting

04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.670 --> 04:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
monday on monday yeah
 
04:33:53.990 --> 04:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and uh in the afternoon again but are
 
04:33:56.789 --> 04:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
there specific things that that that
 
04:33:58.709 --> 04:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee would like to hear
 
04:33:58.719 --> 04:33:59.670 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee would like to hear
about

04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:34:02.470 --> 04:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
um or like to learn about next week
 
04:34:04.709 --> 04:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
what i had in mind was
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
should you wish to continue
 
04:34:09.349 --> 04:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
was inviting people in the community who
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
are already engaged in self-generated
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
attempts to improve education in various
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
ways i'm thinking of one group that is
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
inviting is working on digital equity
 
04:34:25.029 --> 04:34:25.039 align:start position:0%
another group that is working on
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
i see i think it's with
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't trust my memory but manchester
 
04:34:31.029 --> 04:34:31.039 align:start position:0%
high school maybe
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
and a west
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
west high school was in favor of a gen
 
04:34:41.830 --> 04:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
ed uh digital equity not digital uh
 
04:34:43.990 --> 04:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
equitable education thing that was
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
changed to include fiscal
 
04:34:46.959 --> 04:34:48.551 align:start position:0%
changed to include fiscal
fluency

04:34:48.551 --> 04:34:48.561 align:start position:0%
fluency
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
because they had a heart and a large
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
number of students who were not fiscal
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
they weren't banked because they didn't
 
04:34:56.150 --> 04:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
trust banks from where they came from
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's a financial literacy all that whole
 
04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
package and they wanted to include that
 
04:35:03.269 --> 04:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
is that something that's part of this
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
that we might need to look at and say
 
04:35:07.670 --> 04:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
well gee okay maybe if we triggered that
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
now we have people who are willing to
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
work in a bank in a school in high
 
04:35:12.080 --> 04:35:13.109 align:start position:0%
work in a bank in a school in high
school

04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
and now go into bank going to community
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
college and get certain skills and maybe
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
they need more skills to become
 
04:35:23.510 --> 04:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
quote-unquote a banker at whatever level
 
04:35:27.670 --> 04:35:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
educationally driven economic
 
04:35:30.240 --> 04:35:32.230 align:start position:0%
educationally driven economic
development

04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:35:33.670 --> 04:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
we have to figure out how to get
 
04:35:36.629 --> 04:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
education into that formula just as you
 
04:35:39.189 --> 04:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
were discussing the person that the
 
04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
bachelor associates rightly did
 
04:35:43.910 --> 04:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing for his career
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
that's a warning symbol to me
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
we aren't keeping ourselves relevant
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe we have to go out and market it
 
04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
the thing that occurred to me was
 
04:35:57.990 --> 04:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
remember when when cars had starters on
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
the floor and you had to mess your shoes
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
up every time you started your cars
 
04:36:04.470 --> 04:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
i'm that old
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
04:36:08.070 --> 04:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden they changed
 
04:36:09.830 --> 04:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think they changed because of high
 
04:36:09.840 --> 04:36:12.070 align:start position:0%
i think they changed because of high
heels

04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
heels
 
04:36:14.150 --> 04:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
women just just couldn't do that didn't
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to do it didn't want to mess up
 
04:36:18.470 --> 04:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
their shoes but i mean okay it changed
 
04:36:20.629 --> 04:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
the shape of our starters are done well
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to rethink
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
are we doing something that's keeping
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
people out of school or encouraging them
 
04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
in school making that degree worthwhile
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that's what marketing does
 
04:36:36.629 --> 04:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:37.750 --> 04:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:36:37.760 --> 04:36:39.029 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yes

04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
follow up to representative lunos
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
so i i'm thinking here and i'm glad that
 
04:36:45.830 --> 04:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
he asked that question because i'm
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand this is an interim
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
study bill now
 
04:36:50.709 --> 04:36:50.719 align:start position:0%
i shared a couple of subcommittees on
 
04:36:52.949 --> 04:36:52.959 align:start position:0%
retain bills last fall in the in the
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we voted
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
so process-wise and i know there is
 
04:37:02.629 --> 04:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
another meeting penciled in
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand to follow
 
04:37:07.269 --> 04:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
up on on his question um
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
do you see us taking a vote on the
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
or making a recommendation to the full
 
04:37:15.429 --> 04:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
committee based on the statute that the
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
proposed statute we're looking at or
 
04:37:19.349 --> 04:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
where do you see us going from here no i
 
04:37:21.910 --> 04:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
would invite you to offer ways to modify
 
04:37:21.920 --> 04:37:23.109 align:start position:0%
would invite you to offer ways to modify
that

04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
even including deleting the original
 
04:37:25.119 --> 04:37:26.230 align:start position:0%
even including deleting the original
words

04:37:26.230 --> 04:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
words
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
and reconfigure it to offer suggestions
 
04:37:30.629 --> 04:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
or requirements
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
on how we can improve
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
access to higher education
 
04:37:38.869 --> 04:37:38.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
follow-up would you be doing the report
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
to the committees that how this works no
 
04:37:44.070 --> 04:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
i was thinking
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
my thoughts were whom can we get to come
 
04:37:48.709 --> 04:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
here and tell us how it's needed where
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's needed and i was looking to each of
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
the people in this room
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
think you know someone that knows
 
04:37:57.429 --> 04:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
something about this or is doing this in
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
ex high school or ex community college
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever come talk to us about what
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
we can do to make that work better
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
as a community college as a university
 
04:38:12.150 --> 04:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
as a whatever we want to see
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
some way by which we can say you came to
 
04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
us and said we're doing this so we can
 
04:38:20.150 --> 04:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
then respond and when they say what are
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
you doing for education we will respond
 
04:38:24.629 --> 04:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
we have worked with these people maybe
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
only as a broker
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
but we'd have enabled them we've
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
supported them and we will fund whatever
 
04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
attempt to fund whatever it is that we
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
think solves that need we're open to it
 
04:38:38.390 --> 04:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
some of it's symbolic
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
some of it just says we're here and
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're ready to work with you
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
but some part of it is getting something
 
04:38:46.070 --> 04:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
done back to uh
 
04:38:47.830 --> 04:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
right that's what i'd see yesterday
 
04:38:49.670 --> 04:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
oliver would you i assume then that
 
04:38:51.189 --> 04:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
you'll work with the chair of the
 
04:38:52.949 --> 04:38:52.959 align:start position:0%
committee to decide where this is going
 
04:38:53.910 --> 04:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:38:53.920 --> 04:38:56.789 align:start position:0%
to go
logistically

04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
well in terms of coming back i was in
 
04:38:58.799 --> 04:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
well in terms of coming back i was in
sec

04:38:59.830 --> 04:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
sec
 
04:39:01.750 --> 04:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
expecting to ask you
 
04:39:04.070 --> 04:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
should we invite people like that and do
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
you know people you want invited let me
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.920 --> 04:39:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
personally

04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
personally
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
personally i think the systems are doing
 
04:39:15.429 --> 04:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
a good job in terms of access
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i do not know any people who would
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
be added to the list to come in and talk
 
04:39:20.080 --> 04:39:20.869 align:start position:0%
be added to the list to come in and talk
about

04:39:20.869 --> 04:39:20.879 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:39:23.750 --> 04:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
increased access into the system so i i
 
04:39:29.590 --> 04:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ford i would
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
concur with um
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
04:39:37.109 --> 04:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
i think your your point has been well
 
04:39:39.350 --> 04:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrated to the
 
04:39:40.868 --> 04:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
folks that here today representing the
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
community college and university system
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
i think listening to what we've heard
 
04:39:47.030 --> 04:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
today they are constantly working
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
together trying to find alternatives to
 
04:39:51.670 --> 04:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
youngsters to continue their education
 
04:39:53.670 --> 04:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
albeit from the high school cte to the
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
community college community college to
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
four-year and a work field
 
04:40:00.390 --> 04:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
having done some a little bit of work at
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
the college level i know after 12 years
 
04:40:05.510 --> 04:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
in that situation i didn't like to waste
 
04:40:07.190 --> 04:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
my time in a lot of meetings just
 
04:40:09.510 --> 04:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
talking about someone else's thinking
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
i i would be hard-pressed to ask these
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen to come back again
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
on their time i think they have if i'm
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
reading what i think i hear you say
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
if in their deliberations and their
 
04:40:23.590 --> 04:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
communications amongst each other if
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
they find a need for our assistance
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
legislatively statutorily or financially
 
04:40:31.190 --> 04:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
um that they would come back and ask
 
04:40:33.270 --> 04:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
that i think that's what i'm hearing so
 
04:40:36.310 --> 04:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that asking uh continuing
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
this dialogue with them will be good use
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
of their time or or the communities
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's just one person speaking no i
 
04:40:45.830 --> 04:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying and i remember
 
04:40:45.840 --> 04:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying and i remember
the

04:40:46.550 --> 04:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
the meeting that the chancellor and i
 
04:40:48.240 --> 04:40:49.110 align:start position:0%
the meeting that the chancellor and i
were

04:40:49.110 --> 04:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:40:49.120 --> 04:40:49.830 align:start position:0%
were
at

04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:40:52.150 --> 04:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
in which a representative of the
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
university board stood up and explained
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
to me that they could only build a
 
04:40:58.628 --> 04:40:58.638 align:start position:0%
program in response to someone asking
 
04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
for him that immediately followed the
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
conversation i had had with the only
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
student present
 
04:41:07.670 --> 04:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
who nodded yes to everything i said
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
about their needing encouragement
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
and i kept saying he's not hearing that
 
04:41:12.958 --> 04:41:13.990 align:start position:0%
and i kept saying he's not hearing that
student

04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
he doesn't hear him at all i wasn't
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
offended i just noted that
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
and i went and spoke to the student
 
04:41:20.320 --> 04:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
and i went and spoke to the student
afterwards

04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
but i also spoke with you and a number
 
04:41:25.190 --> 04:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
of other people
 
04:41:27.350 --> 04:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
but the idea was that i think they're
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
people we're not hearing we need to find
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
out how to hear them so
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
i would say for next week let me try to
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
get some people who can come in who've
 
04:41:38.868 --> 04:41:38.878 align:start position:0%
been working with these people as well
 
04:41:40.948 --> 04:41:40.958 align:start position:0%
as others and see if there's another
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
element one more meeting and then if we
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
don't have it we don't have anything to
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
pursue we're done
 
04:41:51.590 --> 04:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that agreeable i mean is that
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
well i know but i can't drive you into
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
the corner the question is i don't want
 
04:41:57.510 --> 04:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
a committee that doesn't want to engage
 
04:41:57.520 --> 04:41:58.390 align:start position:0%
a committee that doesn't want to engage
it

04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:42:00.628 --> 04:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
and you know i'm was pleased to have the
 
04:42:02.868 --> 04:42:02.878 align:start position:0%
membership we have because these are
 
04:42:05.030 --> 04:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
experiences dave's been on the board for
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
20 something years he said i hope i'm
 
04:42:10.868 --> 04:42:10.878 align:start position:0%
not giving away any secrets
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so my sense is he's pretty committed
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
to that
 
04:42:15.750 --> 04:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
i would invite you at least one more
 
04:42:17.520 --> 04:42:19.430 align:start position:0%
i would invite you at least one more
time

04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
talk about it see is there something
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
more we can do it i'm open to any and
 
04:42:24.480 --> 04:42:25.350 align:start position:0%
more we can do it i'm open to any and
every

04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:42:25.360 --> 04:42:27.430 align:start position:0%
every
source

04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
source
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have all the answers i
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
just have a question i can't quite
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
put the bid
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
are we doing enough what more could we
 
04:42:38.550 --> 04:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
be doing
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that's what i'm asking you to say by
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
the next meeting and then we're probably
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
done you can bring another colleague
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
chair i've talked to several uh
 
04:42:50.550 --> 04:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
just that sort of how can we better do
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
the coordination between schools better
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
than or do they need something to make
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
it work better
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
the issue of faculty not wanting to
 
04:43:01.030 --> 04:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
travel to a distant campus how do we
 
04:43:02.230 --> 04:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
address that we don't want to get in
 
04:43:05.030 --> 04:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
negotiations we're not here as a
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
negotiating team
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
they've got collective bargaining for
 
04:43:08.480 --> 04:43:10.708 align:start position:0%
they've got collective bargaining for
that

04:43:10.708 --> 04:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
i know that only too well
 
04:43:13.120 --> 04:43:13.990 align:start position:0%
i know that only too well
so

04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
how do we do what we can do to foster
 
04:43:16.560 --> 04:43:17.830 align:start position:0%
how do we do what we can do to foster
innovation

04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
innovation
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
04:43:19.200 --> 04:43:19.990 align:start position:0%
that's just
the

04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
most concise
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
answer i can give to the question but i
 
04:43:25.830 --> 04:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
don't want to not if someone keeps
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
telling me in the operation oh you got
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
to put somebody in charge of that
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
that's us
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
that's how i see it
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
