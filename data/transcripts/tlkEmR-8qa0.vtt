00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 align:start position:0%
you ready Mr Ripple okay um we're just
 
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure we got our clerking
 
00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh you you've got this
 
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
one representative wer yep okay so um
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
with being 10 o'clock we're going to
 
00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 align:start position:0%
open a work session on division three uh
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to stick to the calendar and
 
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
go sequentially for those uh curious
 
00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
about timing it's hard to predict how
 
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
how long each of these is going to take
 
00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
um I um at the end also we're going to
 
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
invite some uh one-sided discussion on
 
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.670 align:start position:0%
invite some uh one-sided discussion on
on

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 align:start position:0%
s499 a a bill that division 3 dealt with
 
00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 align:start position:0%
already and sent to the full finance
 
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
committee there's been ongoing
 
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department that I
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
think we need to be aware of just
 
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 align:start position:0%
because it's going to go to the finance
 
00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
committee later um without coming back
 
00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
through division
 
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 align:start position:0%
three all right so um
 
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
I thank representative Mooney for uh
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
chairing our work session last time I
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
had uh a surgery on my nose and uh so I
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
think I'm ready to
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
go SB
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
352 um is a bill that uh establishes an
 
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
early detection cancer screening pilot
 
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
program for active and retired
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
firefighters I think the the high Lev on
 
00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
this was that we had sort of
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
bipartisan um agreement that removing
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
skin cancer from the list was probably
 
00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 align:start position:0%
the right way to go and that we had some
 
00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:45.159 align:start position:0%
discussions about the cap um
 
00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.509 align:start position:0%
discussions about the cap um
representative

I didn't get a copy but or or I didn't
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
keep track of a copy is probably more

accurate I'm not sure you were here to
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.670 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

pretty
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
brief but if you want I can quickly
 
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
touch on what it highlight highlight
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
your Amendment please sure thing um so
 
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
this um was actually drafted based on um
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
the requested changes by the
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um which included um removing
 
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
the skin cancer
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
requirement which was in um on the
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
believe and then it
 
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.469 align:start position:0%
believe and then it
also

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
removes the
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
$1300 cap which if I'm looking at the
 
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
original Bill I'm going to try to find
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
it which I believe is on page two of the
 
00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.189 align:start position:0%
it which I believe is on page two of the
original

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.990 align:start position:0%
original
Bill

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
line well no I think it's actually line
 
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.070 align:start position:0%
line well no I think it's actually line
six

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
not to exceed the cost of
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
1300 line 14 on page two is going to
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
remain that section is reimbursement if
 
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
someone got a test on their own it will
 
00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
still be capped at 1300 so my Amendment
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
only removes um the first mention of the
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
1300 oh I'm sorry sorry I didn't want to
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
interrupt you and I just wanted to point
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
out that it does maintain up to a $5
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
million expense for the entire program
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that is rained in and and
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't go um you know over budget uh
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
for what we're looking at for the
 
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 align:start position:0%
program I think that's it may may I ask
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
you a question
 
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.950 align:start position:0%
you a question
sure

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
um do we already have in place a
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system that would handle
 
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
firefighters from around the state to
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
keep track of their spend and keep track
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
of what they're authorized for
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and can disperse money and
 
00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 align:start position:0%
keep a record of what's been dispersed
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
do we already have that system I believe
 
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for others who
 
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
are um very involved with the program
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh Mr will okay is there anyone
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
that can address that question do we
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
have go
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
ahead uh say your name uh slowly uh for
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
the clerk oh you have it okay tell me
 
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
because I have a bad memory for the
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
record Brian re president of the
 
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a fire captain in the city
 
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
of Portsmouth um thank you for your
 
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
question so the a a program similar to
 
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
this has been done in the state before
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
um through the department of safety um
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
there was a reimbursement program for
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
Life Scan physicals for retirees to get
 
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
Life Scan physicals for retirees to get
a

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh physical um nfba 158 2
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
physical and this occurred um within the
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
last uh I would say 5 years or so so the
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
the state has done a similar program in
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
the past how did that go did we did we
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
handle that reimbursement system well uh
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
who who was accountable for the system
 
00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
and who was accountable for sort of the
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
fiduciary uh control and responsibility
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
I believe the department of safety was
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
the department of safety and they uh
 
00:07:58.830 --> 00:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
when we asked them about the logistics
 
00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:00.039 align:start position:0%
of this program
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
they said it's not a problem we've done
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
it before so is there anyone here from
 
00:08:06.909 --> 00:08:06.919 align:start position:0%
the department of safety that could
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
verify that I mean I believe you I just
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
sure want to see if we can get kind of
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
an independent believe I've seen anyone
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
here this morning oh
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right um because that's
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
obviously a big deal right you know
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
launching a program and then finding out
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
if we don't really have the system to do
 
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
it all but um all right uh I'm going to
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go on your word and say
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's been done the department has said
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's okay um all right so representative
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
Leon did you did you have anything
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
further you wanted to say on your
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment no I think that's good I'll if
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
I have more to share I will okay
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative Leon uh yes thank you Mr
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Mr Ripple has the amendment
 
00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
that I had drafted um we got it just
 
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
this morning there is one small error
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm seeing the second part actually
 
00:08:58.509 --> 00:08:58.519 align:start position:0%
was supposed to insert a new section B
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
in sub paragraph v um and it shouldn't
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
be replacing the current one that one
 
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:05.800 align:start position:0%
should the the current sub paragraph B
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
should exist that's the expenditure of
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
funds not being made available for more
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
than 24 months after the approval okay
 
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
let's hang on until we get the copy of
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
your Amendment and I'll need probably 20
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
seconds to skim it okay
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:46.110 align:start position:0%
 
thank

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
done so um if I I can wait just a second
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry I'm my lip are moving that
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'm ready thanks okay
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um so my concern is over the
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
language in the vendor preference um
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
because it specifically says a
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
multi-cancer blood test that detects
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
signals from as many cancer types as
 
00:10:37.069 --> 00:10:37.079 align:start position:0%
possible including those that are
 
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:39.200 align:start position:0%
commonly unscreened we've had a lot of
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about one specific test
 
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
that's seen some pretty significant
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
adoption at some cancer centers near us
 
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
but if you actually look at that
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
language and see and read it
 
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically it says from as many cancer
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
types as possible there are some other
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
tests that are in development that have
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
more cancers that are detected but at a
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
lower accuracy rate than the one that is
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
preferred by the professional
 
00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire having
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
this language in may actually make it
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
harder for them to have the preferred
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
test if there are other tests that test
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
for more cancers at a lower accuracy
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
rate removing that vendor preference
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't prohibit them from including
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
that test in the screening program
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
because in the language um for a um I I
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
retain the blood test I change it
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as representative
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
tarki's um section A so that language
 
00:11:30.509 --> 00:11:30.519 align:start position:0%
onlines for through six of mine is
 
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as the language of
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
lines 3 through five of her Amendment so
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
um including continuing to include a
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
blood test would still allow for that
 
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
test to be part of this program and to
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
be adopted it simply would not require
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
that the the the way that it's done um
 
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
looking at this so that's the first part
 
00:11:52.949 --> 00:11:52.959 align:start position:0%
is that this this may actually not
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
permit the test that is preferred to be
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
chosen in the vendor preference because
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
there are some tests that screen for
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
more cancers so it's just an issue of
 
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
the language the other part is that I I
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
I intended can can you hold there yes I
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
had a little bit of trouble following
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
you because I'm looking at the amendment
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
language and I'm not sure which
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
sentences um create the the balance
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
between screening for maximum cancers
 
00:12:24.399 --> 00:12:25.470 align:start position:0%
between screening for maximum cancers
while

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
minimizing false positives is there is
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
there language in here that does that or
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like you think there
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
is but I'm not seeing it no there's um
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question there's not
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
actually any language that does that my
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment on lines 7 through n um
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
basically deletes lines 9 and 10 of the
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
original Bill and collapses um line
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
eight with lines 11 through 13 so that
 
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
there there's vendor preference for the
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
ultrasound test um I simply make it so
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
that it's silent I think that if uh we
 
00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
were to continue to have language um if
 
00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
were to keep number one it should have
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
language to balance the accuracy with
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
the number of tests that are included
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
because there's been discussion about
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that there are others um
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham actually has
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
some pretty significant experience with
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
another test that has a higher that has
 
00:13:16.829 --> 00:13:16.839 align:start position:0%
a strong accuracy rate but only for 12
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
types of cancers um there are there are
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
quite a few that are in development and
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
um that's why that's why having some
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
having that language may cause a problem
 
00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
so if I can just give you a little bit
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
of background on that MD Anderson which
 
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
is one of the big cancer centers in New
 
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:35.480 align:start position:0%
York says um there's currently around 20
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
tests in development they offer
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
screening for anywhere from two to over
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
50 tumor types in a single test some of
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
the cancers the test can detect include
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
pancreatic prostate kidney lung breast
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
skin ovarian and liver cancer so there's
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of these in development and if
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
we're not careful about this language
 
00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
that prioritizes the vendors we may
 
00:13:58.189 --> 00:13:58.199 align:start position:0%
actually Force the decision to go with a
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
lower quality test because of that and
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
knowing the strong preference for having
 
00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:05.759 align:start position:0%
one of these blood tests if it's not
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise available to the
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters removing that from the
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
vendor preference doesn't mean that
 
00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:13.519 align:start position:0%
there's not a significant likelihood
 
00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
that it will that this this test or one
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
like this will be included if it's not
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise available to Firefighters but
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
we're not locking in um language that
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
could lead to bad policy because it may
 
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
force them to adopt something other than
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
the gallery test that's being used at MD
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
Anderson and Mass General Hospital so um
 
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
this this is a way of removing language
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
that may be a problem um the other and
 
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
so does that make sense there it it it
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
it it does I had a different question
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
for you on your Amendment okay are you
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
ready um if it's in that se because I I
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
interrupted you when you finished one
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
point did you want to continue with your
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
second point I was going to talk about
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
the other section if your questions
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
about this section we should have it now
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
no I'm I'm I would ask you about sort of
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
this third SE section that I'm not
 
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
really seeing and that's representative
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
Tori uh on her Amendment on lines 9 and
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
10 uh makes it clear that firefighters
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
will have the option do do we if if we
 
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
were to go with the bulk of your
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
amendment should we in your opinion pick
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
up lines nine and 10 from the tersi
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is is is that is that an
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
important part to to this program um
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
well thank you the language that's in
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
there is already optional but the tersi
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
amendment removes the cap what my
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
section there does is it looks to insert
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
in a separate section so that if the
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
screening costs are less than
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
$1,300 um a firefighter would be able to
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed for any of the other
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing that needs to be done
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
to follow up either from this blood test
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
or the lung CT or from the ultrasounds
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
because follow-up tests are not covered
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
under Insurance regularly um if there is
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
a finding we just pass a bill in the
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
house that makes it so that the
 
00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up testing for mammograms when
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
there is a signal found or in a
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
screening that that is covered under
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
insurance so so yes ma'am I I think you
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
answered a question but it wasn't the
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
one I thought I was asking okay okay so
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and 10 of the tersi
 
00:16:21.309 --> 00:16:21.319 align:start position:0%
amendment it says firefighter
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
participation in cancer screening shall
 
00:16:26.509 --> 00:16:26.519 align:start position:0%
be optional and a firefighter shall be
 
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive any combination of
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
off offered screenings so so the thing
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
that jumps out at me that's distinct in
 
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
her Amendment from yours is she has
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
specific language that says the
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
firefighter participation is optional so
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
my question to you is if we went with
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
the bulk of your amendment should we
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
bring from the tersi amendment the
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
option for firefighters to participate
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not changing section I'm not
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
changing those lines in the original
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
bill so my Amendment doesn't touch um
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh 5 a and I have no problem
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
with that um when I add in the other one
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
just like the reimbursement section
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's in paragraph six that allows a
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement up to 1300 by offering the
 
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursement including the other
 
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
followup test up to 1300 it's consistent
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
policy-wise while helping with the out-
 
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
of- pocket costs right so let me go to
 
00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
you representative torki you you you put
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
in your Amendment lines nine and 10 for
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
a reason if this isn't changing the
 
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill why why is it here I'm
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
assuming it does change the underlying
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
Bill my language is in the underlying
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
bill on page two of the bill lines six
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
and 7 yeah all I did was remove the
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
words let me make sure I get it
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
right on page six I remove the words not
 
00:17:57.789 --> 00:17:57.799 align:start position:0%
to exceed a cost of $1,300 per
 
00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:00.470 align:start position:0%
to exceed a cost of $1,300 per
individual

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:18:02.149 --> 00:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
so these two these two bills amendments
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
are compatible they're not in Conflict
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're not there's not a gap here I'm
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure we got a good
 
00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
merger I don't I'm not particularly
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
jumping into a
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
merger I know I'm I am though I'm just
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
trying to see if if they they should be
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
merged and if they did what it would
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
take to make sure that the intent of
 
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:28.280 align:start position:0%
your your bill is is carried over this
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
section I have haven't dug into very
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
deeply on the Layon Amendment but I do
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
have some concerns on the um removal of
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
the multi-cancer blood test language so
 
00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm still
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
digesting this second part okay okay so
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
the it seems to me
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
that if we don't have language in here
 
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:59.750 align:start position:0%
that if we don't have language in here
that

00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
basically says that we need to avoid
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
tests as much as possible that have an
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
unreasonable false positive rate will
 
00:19:11.789 --> 00:19:11.799 align:start position:0%
end up sending firefighters into the
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
screening getting a false positive in
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
many many
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
cases causing family
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
anxiety and then additional cost of the
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
program so so how how are you
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
balancing uh good tests to ident
 
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.630 align:start position:0%
balancing uh good tests to ident
identify

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
screening from avoid and avoid while
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
avoiding tests that create an
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily high level of false
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
positives um so what I the way I intend
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
to do that is actually partly outside of
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative process I've already
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
begun speaking been begun trying to
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
arrange meetings um with with with
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
oncologists from Dartmouth we have one
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
that'll be speaking at a lunch next
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
Wednesday from 12: to 1 about biomarkers
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
and this is related to biomarkers um in
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
order to arrange a clinical trial of New
 
00:20:06.029 --> 00:20:06.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire firefighters looking at the
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
additional benefit from this test in
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
addition to the ex ex these other
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
standard screening tests to see how much
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
more cancer it finds and how much more
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
of a benefit it finds because right now
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
this test isn't it's not approved by the
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
FDA yet because they're still doing
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
studies for approval it's not
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
recommended by any medical societies
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's not reimbursed by anybody although
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
there is efforts so that it will be
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
immediately covered upon FDA approval
 
00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
for medic Medicare um it's important to
 
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
know how much of a benefit it has and
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
because firefighters are at increased
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
risk it's very important to know how
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
much more benefit it provides to them
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's quite possible they may see a
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
greater benefit from this than the
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
average person but we don't know that
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
and nobody will know that without data
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
so the American Cancer Society and the
 
00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
International Association of
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters work together on screening
 
00:21:00.029 --> 00:21:00.039 align:start position:0%
guidelines New Hampshire could actually
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
lead the way if we do actual study to
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
see how much benefit there is so that
 
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
that can become adopted for firefighters
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
across the country we have our own
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
Center of clinical and research
 
00:21:13.149 --> 00:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
Excellence at Dartmouth and we have
 
00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
several south of our border at Dana
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
Farber and Mass general doctors love to
 
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
do research and it's easy to get both
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
that it's easier to get that test and
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
the follow-up screenings required to get
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
the data needed for that study paid for
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
by other people so it won't be paid out
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
of pocket by the firefighters if they're
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
in that study which will benefit them
 
00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
get them the information they need and
 
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
be able to help them have better
 
00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:39.919 align:start position:0%
outcomes and help them help their
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
brothers across the country to know the
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
data and know that know if this is a
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
test that is actually going to going to
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
be a strong benefit right so so what I'd
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
like to do is because I I think this is
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
the first time we've had a chance to see
 
00:21:57.909 --> 00:21:57.919 align:start position:0%
this text um I I would like to go ahead
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
and uh basically pause further
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
352 and uh that way when we we can we'll
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
recess for lunch or something and then
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
so folks can on a onetoone basis have
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
this discussion uh not we can't meet
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
with a quorum but we can talk it through
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll come back this
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon and figure out you know how we
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
would execute or how what we would
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
recommend that that's my proposal is
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
there and I apologize to the fire
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters who've showed up that this
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
is um not not going to U be immediately
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
gratifying to you but I but I think I
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
would encourage you H to have some
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
confidence in this process we all sort
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
of are aligned on the idea that I
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe we are we're all aligned on the
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
idea that firefighters do because of the
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
inhaling of tox and exposure to toxic
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
materials while conducting a very vital
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
Public Safety function that we have an
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
obl ation um uh to uh help you screen
 
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
and protect against it and we're trying
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to do it in a way in
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
which um uh the program is effective and
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
that we're not locking in language that
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
will lock in Vendor choices over the
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
long term we need this language to
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
breathe so that new medical technology
 
00:23:26.269 --> 00:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
comes out we can adapt to it so uh so we
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
want to be careful there yes yes ma'am I
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
think we would be um fine with sitting
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
on it for a little bit and um having
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
some conversations at lunch but I did
 
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to take the time to acknowledge and
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank the very large number of
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters who are here the people who
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
are watching at home maybe they
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
obviously cannot see um the large
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
turnout that we have and I want to thank
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
them for their advocacy in this um and
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward so thank you very
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair all right I I I agree
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you very
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair I too have an amend mment
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
it's number 1869 H and while we're on
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
the topic of Senate Bill
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
352 I figure we go over this so that
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
when everyone breaks to discuss uh they
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
will have all of the amendments in front
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
of them and I'll be glad to explain what
 
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
okay I I think I think I'm caught up
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
yours Amendment varies uh as I if I'm as
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it a little from
 
00:24:53.159 --> 00:24:54.830 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at it a little from
representative

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
toris uh with the uh lines three of hers
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the line three of yours from there
 
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
on down that's a that's a little
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
different and that uh lines nine and 10
 
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm reading it right they're
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
identical your your nine and 10 is the
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
same as toki's nine and 10 that's true
 
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay so why don't you tell us about the
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
distinction you're making in lines three
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
through five okay thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
so my amendment is based off of the
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
tersi amendment number 1760
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
it struck me while reading the original
 
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill that on
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
lines five through seven on page one and
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
I brought this up at our work session on
 
00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday there's a word and in there so
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
it proceeds to list the cancer screening
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
options and it uses the word and that to
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
me reads that all of these are required
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
so my Amendment instead clarifies by
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
saying any combination of one or more of
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
the following
 
00:26:04.269 --> 00:26:04.279 align:start position:0%
tests and that is specific in my
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment lines 4 and five is where that
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
inserted language appears any
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
combination of one or more of the
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
following tests this then to me reads as
 
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
though you know maybe one test is uh
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
preferred or required but the other's
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
not a clarifier from the original
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
language then the second part of my
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment basically does the same thing
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
in that section Roman 5 lowercase a
 
00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so I I need to sum this
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
up so I'm tracking with you um it looks
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
like uh lines 4 through six of the Layon
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is uh is the same as yours or
 
00:26:53.029 --> 00:26:53.039 align:start position:0%
not no I like hers better though I've
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
not you like hers better yes okay and
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
then uh her or uh the lay on Amendment
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
adds lines 7 through n that yours does
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
not do you do you how do you react to
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
the Layon lines 7 through n if we were
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
to try to merge all of these would would
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
we want to pick up the lay on 7 through
 
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
nine I haven't uh fully done a side by
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
side of mine Amendment with hers so I
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
would um have to think about that but my
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
in my Amendment naturally the Layon
 
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
language lines 7 through n is not
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
included so I don't get into to vendors
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
specific or false positive um innuendos
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
mine is a clarifier that you may need
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
one or two tests but certainly not a a
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
Full Slate required love that part I
 
00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:53.559 align:start position:0%
love that part I'm just trying to U on
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
the Fly get grasp what we're going to do
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
here we have three amendments that I
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
think improves the bill but rather than
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
have three amendments we should just try
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
to figure out if we could create
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
one that that's what I'm trying to do
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
understood okay I would wait on that
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
considering my was made right represent
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
tki addition to the tersi amend I just
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge that at first read
 
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
I like the Mooney Amendment a lot I
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
think it does clarify um and I was just
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
wondering though if there's a chance Mr
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
will could return to the mic and just
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
give us his perspective on it um because
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
I know that there was some discussion
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
back and forth on the language
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
Choice sure uh I I I just am curious if
 
00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:49.519 align:start position:0%
we've offered him enough opportunity to
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
see all of this and have an opportunity
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
to integrate it and take a position so
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
quickly um thank you and if you can you
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
should become a
 
00:29:03.149 --> 00:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
legislator well I I just so happened to
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
know that um there were some similar
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
amendments coming because we did discuss
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
it in the last meeting um so this isn't
 
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh really the first time we're hearing
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
about it um I thank representative
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
Mooney representative tersi and
 
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative Leon for for putting some
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
thought into this um representative
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
Mooney and representative tarki's
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment combined um would be exactly
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
what the fire lki and Mooney yep would
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
be exactly amendments that we would be
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
looking for um for this testing again
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's already been vetted out in multiple
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
committees it's already gone through
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
multiple floor votes um what I think is
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
important to draw a conclusion from is
 
00:29:43.509 --> 00:29:43.519 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're not uh handcuffing
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for a
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
long-term screening process that is
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to include any specific vendors or
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
any specific tests the idea here is to
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
cast a wide net to test for as many
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
cancers as possible so that we can
 
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
further identify how we need to um bring
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
the guard rails in for the future but
 
00:30:07.149 --> 00:30:07.159 align:start position:0%
this is just a one-time funding
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity we're not asking for the
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire to expend funds
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity for any uh given test this
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
is just uh these tests and uh the
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
Amendments from representative uh tki
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
and representative Mooney um are what we
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
are looking for um to identify cancers
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
amongst our members so you're being very
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
diplom itic what what is it if anything
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
that you uh think the lay on Amendment
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
adds that's positive that's positive yes
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do the negatives fair
 
00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:51.269 align:start position:0%
we don't need to do the negatives fair
enough

00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
um I'm struggling to identify something
 
00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
represent all right well so we are going
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
to you know do launch and stuff and you
 
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
you could maybe look at that a little
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
deeper okay M all right go ahead
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
represent leam um thank you Mr chairman
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I know you've just had this in front
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
of you um I I'd ask that you look to the
 
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
section that would allow reimbursement
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
for any any follow-up screening tests
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
because I know at least one of the
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters in Manchester had to pay
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for a followup after his
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
lung CT and I want to be sensitive to
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
that cost for our firefighters so I'm
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
not putting you on the spot for an
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
answer but I I I thought that that would
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
be helpful one right right that's that
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
sounds to me to be a very positive thing
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
if I were a firefighter that we're going
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
to screen and then if the screening is
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
positive then we're going to be there to
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
help cover the cost of follow-up
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
treatment to get a definitive diagnosis
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
rather than having that followup be out
 
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
of pocket or right is that is that is
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
that what you're trying to do that is
 
00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
the specific intent so thank you
 
00:31:57.389 --> 00:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
representative um I would say that in
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
most cas and I'm unaware of the case
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
that you're you're speaking of but in
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
most cases um if there is a cancer
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
identified through one of these tests or
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
a cancer signal and they were to get
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up testing um a PCP would be able
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
to give a referral based on that testing
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
and in fact would be covered um so I'm
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
less concerned about that what I'm more
 
00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that it attaches back
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
the $1300 cap um which I don't
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate that a follow-up test
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to the screening will be
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
under the $1,300 cap so I'm hesitant to
 
00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
add that back in and that's what we're
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
trying to remove with the tersi and M
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
amendments okay so I I'm I I missed your
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
turn there you you you you I think your
 
00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:46.870 align:start position:0%
turn there you you you you I think your
position

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
is you're not as concerned about us
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
paying for the follow-up care because it
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
sounds like the regular health insurance
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
and the Health Care system will take
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
care of followup if there's a positive
 
00:32:59.870 --> 00:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
POS screen so you're not really
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
concerned about this bill covering the
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
followup costs is that I think I think
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
in a perfect world if there was
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
unlimited funds then that would then
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
that would be a realistic uh ask but
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is a pilot
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
program only there's a $5 million cap on
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
it um we want to make sure that our
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
members get screened and that money um
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
is is allowing us to cast the wide net
 
00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
um I do believe in many cases our
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up care would be covered through
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
our insurance companies and further
 
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
sorry what um Dr Hamrock had testified
 
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
to the other day um was was if there is
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
in fact a positive test um that is then
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
attached to the insurance company and
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
they own that there would be no
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
additional cost right so so the
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
distinction is you you don't want a
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
$1,300 cap and it's been proposed
 
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.269 align:start position:0%
$1,300 cap and it's been proposed
correct

00:33:58.269 --> 00:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
okay anything else I don't believe so do
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
you have questions representative tki
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
I'm good thank you I appreciated him
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
taking a look at them all okay so it was
 
00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:10.919 align:start position:0%
a lot thrown at you and we'll we'll be
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
back this afternoon on this okay thank
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
you so so I I think I think we're ready
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
to move on to the next bill uh and we'll
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
do I Mr Ripple do I have to recess 352
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
or or is it still within the same work
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
session I think it's they're all noticed
 
00:34:28.829 --> 00:34:28.839 align:start position:0%
for the the same time so it's still
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
within the same work session all right
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
355 relative to newborn screening of a
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
very long
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
c-word um cyal La
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
virus very nice show off hey thanks for

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
okay is I I have a note that says Mr
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
Ripple will get an
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
amendment representa Mooney yes I'd like
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
to introduce an amendment to Senate Bill
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
355 based on our discussions last
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at the work session it's
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
1878 H and I'd like to speak to that
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment it shouldn't be a surprise
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
because uh the topics came up during our
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
work session Tuesday thank you
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
okay do you want to well let's let's
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
follow protocol and give people a chance
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
all right I think I think I'm ready for
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
you to get into this if if you want to
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
expand thank you this bill has undergone
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
several changes uh as it started in the
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
Senate and then came over to the house
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
it came out in our work session Tuesday
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
that two sections were missing as it
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
came to us and so I put them back in the
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
first is in the first section of my
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment and you'll notice specifically
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
on line8 it includes the May opt out of
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
the screenings
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
provision so we're putting that back in
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
May opt
 
00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
out the second piece was the education
 
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
piece we may recall the uh audiologist
 
00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:55.720 align:start position:0%
who spoke to us on Tuesday and she
 
00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
specifically brought this out and that
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
is uh to provide the Department of
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services shall provide
 
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
information on the importance of early
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
detection of cyto megla meglo virus so
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
that now would be put back in the bill
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
so I would ask for support on this uh as
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
we' mentioned uh the fiscal note is
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily minimal and then I would
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
ask for ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
motion after that thank you all right so
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
so I think we can discuss
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
I I um I would like to know if anyone in
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
the room knows which professional
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
Society is is is the one most likely to
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
disease I I have a note that says it was
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
documented so initially in my
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
conversations with the Department uh
 
00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
they noted that this would require 20%
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
of a full-time equivalent position at a
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
cost of $26,000 now typically as an
 
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
office our practice is if a bill isn't
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to result in a new position being
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
filled uh we say there's no fiscal
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
impact So based on the 20% estimate I
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
assume there would be no fiscal impact
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like based on the
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
Department's test testimony earlier this
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
week it might not be quite what I had in
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
mind it sounds like it's a 50% of a
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
position so a part-time of which the
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
general fund share would be 20% um so I
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair to revise this
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal note to say there's a $226,000
 
00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:45.400 align:start position:0%
cost but I haven't yet done that all
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
right all right thank you so so let's
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to get an opportunity after
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
you introduce yourself to talk to
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
whatever you want I I want I do want to
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
get to my question though sure I'm Abby
 
00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
Rogers legislatively ason for the
 
00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services and
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
I'm Courtney Keane with public health
 
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
Courtney all right so um so I don't know
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
how we're all tiered but I imagine that
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
there is a a professional society that
 
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
that focuses on this and worries about
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
this who who is that what what
 
00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:34.359 align:start position:0%
organization would that
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
be so there's a two-tier so the New
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association because
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
the hospitals would be conducting the
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
test is that your question of
 
00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
financially no like uh is it
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
nephrologists is it
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists you know who there must
 
00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
be some you know Medical Professional
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
society that has this diagnosis kind of
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
purview yes audiologists audiologist
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
audiologist aist well in in the focus of
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
this Bill yes but overall would be the
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Pediatrics and also
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
Maternal Fetal Medicine Specialists
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
because there is congenital CMV which is
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
passed from Mom to Baby so that would be
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
a Maternal Fetal OBGYN or pediatrician
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
or as Courtney said um for the resulting
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
hearing loss that can occur with CMV
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
Audiology Society so so I'm I'm just I'm
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
focusing on U represent Presa Mooney's
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that starts on line
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
nine and goes through 15 um directing
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
the department to to take on kind of a
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
form of educational role and uh and two
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
things come to mind one if there's a
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
professional society that has this as
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
part of their you know medical
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
scope those professional societies are
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
responsible for figuring out how to do
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
CME and how to communicate within the
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
profession to let people know and be
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
aware of problems
 
00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
so so that's my understanding is if if
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh then the
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for creating information
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
about this and communicating it to the
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
provider Community is already in place I
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
think am I you you you can you can
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
disagree with me I I'm I'm just telling
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
what I think is the
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
case uh sure I mean individual societies
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
do communicate um on the incidents of
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
CMV but as this is diagnosed in infants
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's usually um pediatricians or the
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
American academ Academy of Pediatrics
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
that would draw attention to the
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
incidence of CMV there this piece of it
 
00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839 align:start position:0%
in line nine um would be the the long
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
short story is that CMV is not
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
recommended for for inclusion under the
 
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
newborn screening program so for the New
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State panel we don't currently
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
screen for CMV as part of that program
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
as a result there is a high there is an
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
incidence in CMV there are mixed uh
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
clinical recommendations that there
 
00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
should be more education around the
 
00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:13.599 align:start position:0%
incidents of CMV both with providers and
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
with parents so this section in line
 
00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
nine was added in our work communicating
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
with Senator inis on his desire to have
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh more education for new parents for
 
00:42:26.349 --> 00:42:26.359 align:start position:0%
parents that may be thinking about
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
having children this is out there that
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
this is something that your child could
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
be diagnosed with because it's not
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
something that we would officially adopt
 
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
through the newborn screening program we
 
00:42:38.109 --> 00:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
do provide information on a variety of
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
other conditions that affect newborns
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
and so we worked with him on on that
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
section to say what we would be happy to
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
contribute some more um education to
 
00:42:49.549 --> 00:42:49.559 align:start position:0%
Providers to parents on the on CMV if if
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
we remove section nine what what is your
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
estimate of the Manpower required to to
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh comply with the bill and the
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that starts on lines 3 through
 
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.470 align:start position:0%
amendment that starts on lines 3 through
eight

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
so it would still be0 2 of a05 FTE and
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's mainly because working with the
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals to get them up and running
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
with CMV testing and then for them to
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
report to the state the screening
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
results so that's where the Manpower is
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
the educ ation is an additional
 
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
component um it would be intertwined
 
00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
with the development with the hospitals
 
00:43:38.109 --> 00:43:38.119 align:start position:0%
on their protocols for screening for
 
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
CMV yeah so my my reluctance to embrace
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
the education component is I don't know
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
that the state has the expertise and the
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
ongoing continuing updates of ongoing
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
research in order to be remain flexible
 
00:43:58.150 --> 00:43:58.160 align:start position:0%
and Nimble on what that education should
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
be and and this is why I think
 
00:44:03.309 --> 00:44:03.319 align:start position:0%
historically professional societies have
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
owned the responsibility of developing
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
CME and priorities and conferences in
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
Las Vegas and that sort of thing so so I
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm a little reluctant to to to to
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
do the education component uh
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative tki thanks I'm just
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
wondering if I could ask you said that
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
regularly they educate on other things
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
during newborn screenings can you give
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
us an idea of what that is and if this
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
is literally just going to be another
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
add-on to a conversation or a flyer or
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever that would help me understand
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so right now the hospitals um OB
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
providers all receive a flyer uh
 
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
pamphlet brochure of all the screenings
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
that are conducted in New Hampshire it's
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of what's done so it provides
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
a little bit of information on the
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
overall screenings that are done it
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be embedded into this it is
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
updated every so often it is not an
 
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.630 align:start position:0%
updated every so often it is not an
indepth

00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:57.640 align:start position:0%
indepth
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
educational material it is just an FYI
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
this is what's going to happen to your
 
00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
baby blah blah blah and that's provided
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
to parents yes okay that helps me a lot
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
um in one of my pregnancies I um had I
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
was flagged for something that a
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
screening found and I at first was a
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
little nervous did some research even
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
without a robust internet back then um
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
understood it better pursued it and
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
educated myself and in the end
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
everything was fine but I think that
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
having that kind of resource available
 
00:45:35.309 --> 00:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
to parents um is is a valuable uh tool
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
to actually have it all in that one uh
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
document so I would encourage um
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining the education
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
section uh thank you for that I I think
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
I think that implies that there's only
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
one source of these pamphlets I'm I'm
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
Pro education I'm Pro parental awareness
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm Pro all of
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
those things I'm just looking at the you
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
know the efficacy over the long run of
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
whether or not the state is as Nimble as
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
it needs to be to keep a pamphlet up to
 
00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:17.319 align:start position:0%
date so I would argue that one piece of
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
information even if it's brief bullet
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
points that incompass the whole Spectrum
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
 
00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.910 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Health and Human
Services

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
versus seven to eight different little
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
Flyers that you know if they all get
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
compiled at once um that one document is
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to be far more effective um than a
 
00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
bunch of others um that one may may be
 
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
about um an issue that maybe isn't as
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
concerning as another one but due to
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
graphic design or publishing choices or
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
whatever this other one may seem more
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
confusing more prominent whatever I just
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know I feel that if they're
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
already doing it I don't see
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
the trouble in adding one more bullet
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
point on are are you the only source of
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
U pamphlets to educate
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
parents uh I would say that they're
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
probably um any OBGYN office or
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
pediatrician may have pamphlets um for
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
for parents that are expecting babies
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
and where do those pamphlets get who who
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
owns the keeping those current and
 
00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:25.160 align:start position:0%
published I would assume that the
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
societies would do that I I think what
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about with um education
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
might be as simple as what is CMV on our
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
website just for a general awareness
 
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
that this is out there and if um babies
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
fail two hearing tests and or tests for
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
CMV this could um prevent uh further
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
language delays due to hearing loss from
 
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.390 align:start position:0%
language delays due to hearing loss from
this

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
condition well I'm anti- hearing
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
loss uh so okay so you've you've heard a
 
00:47:58.109 --> 00:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion about your education
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
component what do you what do you
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
think um I still want would like to make
 
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:07.240 align:start position:0%
a motion to introduce Amendment 1878 H
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
all right we've been okay is there a
 
00:48:14.069 --> 00:48:14.079 align:start position:0%
second second okay
 
00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
um oh Earth because she's a sub it's one
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
of the rules all right but we can make
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right I I we can't but uh so what
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
else would you like to tell us about
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment before I sent yes okay
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative Le on um thank you Mr
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to ask one more
 
00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
question of the department if that
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
education would also include that for
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
babies with hearing loss and a positive
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
CMV antiviral treatment could May
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
reverse that hearing loss I think that
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
would probably be in the scope of a p
 
00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
utrition uh information that they would
 
00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
we would we'd be talking about what is
 
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
CMV general information about CMV any
 
00:49:05.549 --> 00:49:05.559 align:start position:0%
clinical guidelines would definitely go
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
back to the provider societies to
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
provide for patients okay thank you I I
 
00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
thought that was the most important
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
thing but it's important to know that
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
know that that's how you see it thank
 
00:49:15.789 --> 00:49:15.799 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
you yeah question yes so CMV early
 
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:24.200 align:start position:0%
detection is it quickly cured or is this
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
and if it's not do it lead to more
 
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
long-term damage or or what's the
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
importance of this is this something you
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
find it out you can take care of it
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
quickly or if you don't find out it
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
might be a year or two before you get
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
into it and then it's worse that's a
 
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
great question um I don't know the
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
answer in its entirety I will say the
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
sooner that it's detected the faster the
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
treatment can begin um for hearing loss
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
in particular if you catch it early
 
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
they'll screen the child and do
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
diagnostic testing more frequently to
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
reduce the hearing loss as the child
 
00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
you I I I think we're we're ready to uh
 
00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
get get a sense if since this is an
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
amendment I think we could do a show of
 
00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
hands good uh show a hands on who
 
00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
approves this amendment those
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
opposed all right six to nothing I
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
abstained Mr I didn't vote no I I I'm
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
really I'm I'm just really ambivalent
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
about stepping on a professional Society
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
who's built to for this purpose yes
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
ma'am do you want to say something it's
 
00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
already passed by the way so so it has
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
to be really brilliant because we've
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
it oh come on up tell us I teach me
 
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:56.789 align:start position:0%
it oh come on up tell us I teach me
something

00:50:56.789 --> 00:50:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
this is probably the letter this is
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
Carol dry yes thank you um good morning
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards members of the
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Elizabeth Sergeant
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
champan Capital group here representing
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Academy of Audiology
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
we've been working with Abby and
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
Courtney k at DHHS we have sub submitted
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
testimony to this committee um and I
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
guess I will read one sentence to you
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
according to CDC surveys only one in 10
 
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
women of childbearing age have ever
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
heard of it so we certainly support the
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
Department's idea that we would just add
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
it to the um information about it and
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
audiologists certainly would be part of
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
the process after it would get diagnosed
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
at the hospital if they feel a fail a
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
hearing test so we appreciate uh your
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
support all right so go ahead and make
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
it 7
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
nothing all all right thank you thank
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
much all right uh so so now we have to
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
go on the underlying bill and I think we
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
need um a vote on this right so are we
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
going to uh have a motion to adopt or
 
00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
recommend adoption to the finance
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee of s SP 355 with Amendment uh
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
1878 I can make that motion okay so I'd
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%

vote um I should actually call a role
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
representative priest probably should
 
00:52:38.789 --> 00:52:38.799 align:start position:0%
not vote because he just walked he
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%

program my notes
 
00:53:39.309 --> 00:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
suggest that uh representative walner
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
was possibly working on an
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
amendment okay do you want to and then M
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple you were ALS is is your the
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
amendment you were working on the same
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
is hers I have two amendments for this
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
one for representative walner and one
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
for representative money okay why don't
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
no that's all right so so so I'm going
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to do this um the other way
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask representative Mooney
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
to talk to her Amendment because it's
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
pretty short and and then and then we'll
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
talk about representative walner and
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
a a combined
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
discussion what what what representative
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
Mooney would you like to speak to your
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you Mr chair yes uh so
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk on Amendment 1859 9h
 
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
however it is my intention to amend this
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
amendment and so I am going to talk on
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
behalf of that amended Amendment and
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
I'll explain why I I think you need to
 
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
the amended amendment I say that again
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
all right I'll do that I'll do it this
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
way in the amendment in front of you
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
1859 H it is my intention to put in an
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
additional amendment to change the date
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
on line 15
 
00:56:29.789 --> 00:56:29.799 align:start position:0%
from November 1st
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
2024 to November 1st
 
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
2025 okay I
 
00:56:40.829 --> 00:56:40.839 align:start position:0%
understand this the lines prior to that
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
date so all the rest of the bill is
 
00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:47.039 align:start position:0%
essentially the version that came from
 
00:56:47.039 --> 00:56:48.349 align:start position:0%
essentially the version that came from
the

00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
Senate as you recall this bill has
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically from the Senate to
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
the house the Senate version as in in
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
front of you is the establishment of a
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
child care Workforce child care
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
assistance pilot program period with
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
well for my purposes period And so from
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
there you know all of the specifications
 
00:57:12.029 --> 00:57:12.039 align:start position:0%
of that including what will be my
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
amended deadline of November 1
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
2025 the house go ahead the house
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
version implements the program with a
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
price tag of approximately 2.5 million
 
00:57:27.359 --> 00:57:28.990 align:start position:0%
price tag of approximately 2.5 million
or

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:31.349 --> 00:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
thereabouts my Amendment again reverts
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
us back to the Senate version at no cost
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
with a change in date of the report due
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
and that is the amendment I would like
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
to propose thank you okay qu just a
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
question for you if we if if um as my
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
old project management days um if if you
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
were going to do a pilot project it was
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
important to know kind of the start date
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the end date because they're
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
temporary right so you got to have an
 
00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
end date are you do you think that this
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill given the fact that there's a
 
00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:04.359 align:start position:0%
report due makes it clear that there's
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
an end date to the pilot project yes
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
absolutely all right all right so so
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
you're reverting you're basically
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
reverting back to the Senate bill and
 
00:58:18.990 --> 00:58:19.000 align:start position:0%
the policy committee got into outside of
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
policy and added money so yes they did
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
so um they're they're not they're
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
supposed to do policy and and not money
 
00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:29.319 align:start position:0%
as I'm told
 
00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
frequently um but representative walner
 
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.150 align:start position:0%
frequently um but representative walner
go

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so well the one question I have
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
report representative Mooney's amendment
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
is that I'm not sure what the department
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
would be reporting on if no pilot
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
program was going
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
forth I'm not sure what kind of
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
information or data they would
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
be collecting actually I mean it it's a
 
00:59:12.630 --> 00:59:12.640 align:start position:0%
report on a program that doesn't exist
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's a little cumbersome to me
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
with that one so but what um my
 
00:59:21.069 --> 00:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment would
 
00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:23.710 align:start position:0%
Amendment would
do

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
is it would um provide provide for an a
 
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
percentage income guideline that um
 
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line four of the amendment
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
that um households with an income less
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
than 500% of the federal poverty level
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
um would be those that were eligible no
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
one over that would be
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
eligible um the next part of it is in
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
the original Bill the
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
um in the if you went back to the
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
original bill that was introduced I
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
um appropriation was
 
01:00:09.319 --> 01:00:11.910 align:start position:0%
um appropriation was
2.2

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
2.2
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
million to run the
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
program and what I have done is on line
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
24 um basically reduce that to 1 million
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
and the reason for the reduction of the
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
1 m to the 1 million is that the program
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
would not start until January one of
 
01:00:39.309 --> 01:00:39.319 align:start position:0%
2025 so it would run for six months
 
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
cycle yeah you'll see it I was looking
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
for it too I couldn't figure out where
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
it went to it's under effective dat
 
01:00:53.069 --> 01:00:53.079 align:start position:0%
effective date okay so it would it would
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
start on January 1 which really I think
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
gives the
 
01:01:02.029 --> 01:01:02.039 align:start position:0%
department since something like this is
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
probably not going to be passed and
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
signed until in July or you know it will
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
take the department time to set this up
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
I also in here in this Amendment provide
 
01:01:18.589 --> 01:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
that the department can um contract this
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
out so that it's not um it's not the
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
department that would have to run this
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
particular program they could contract
 
01:01:30.309 --> 01:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
it out and I put in
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for the administration of the
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
program they may choose to do it
 
01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
themselves or they may contract it out
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
this probably is not going to be a
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
major major program it's only going to
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
really address the needs of very few
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
people and if I'll just remind you what
 
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
it was what it is
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
about so as you know
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
um child
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
care has had a very difficult time
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining their
 
01:02:08.029 --> 01:02:08.039 align:start position:0%
Workforce and they've been looking
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
for ways of finding incentives to get
 
01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:15.319 align:start position:0%
people into get people into the field
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
and retain them in the
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
field and this is basically offers just
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
an another tool in their toolbox of
 
01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
things that they can do to get people to
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
look at child care as a
 
01:02:33.079 --> 01:02:36.309 align:start position:0%
look at child care as a
profession

01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
um it's probably is not going to be
 
01:02:43.549 --> 01:02:43.559 align:start position:0%
something that there will be a huge
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
number of people that will fall into
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
this category but certainly any number
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
will be good and you you know that we've
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
seen numbers of bills here and we've
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
certainly from being on fiscal we've
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of um groups coming forward
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
to us looking for things like loan
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
forgiveness for their professions U
 
01:03:09.069 --> 01:03:09.079 align:start position:0%
bonuses for their professions I mean all
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
kinds of things to try to encourage
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce so this is just a another
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce retention and
 
01:03:24.750 --> 01:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
um retaining the workforce we have
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
or getting you know getting new people
 
01:03:28.589 --> 01:03:28.599 align:start position:0%
to come into the
 
01:03:31.269 --> 01:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
workforce um questions about the
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I I I do but I I want to make
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
sure uh representative Stringham welcome
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
back uh we have representative wer who's
 
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
taking clerk notes on this so you you
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
can relax for this one because he's got
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
that okay uh I I I I do have um some
 
01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
questions for you representative walner
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh and that is um what what how would
 
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
you describe the employment category of
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
those that would be eligible for this
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
scholarship what I mean you you use the
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
term profession
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
professional what what usually the word
 
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
professional implies some sort of a
 
01:04:16.349 --> 01:04:16.359 align:start position:0%
certification or training qualification
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
or you know what what could you can you
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
describe the the the employment category
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh and what makes it a profession well
 
01:04:28.029 --> 01:04:28.039 align:start position:0%
child care um providers do have
 
01:04:30.750 --> 01:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have to meet um
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
under State licensing requirements so
 
01:04:37.069 --> 01:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
they can come in with a fairly minimum
 
01:04:41.269 --> 01:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
amount of um professional development
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
but as they move through the um career
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
lattice they have to have more and more
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
education and um meet a higher standard
 
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
of Licensing so is there a minimum level
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
of Licensing that we're going to require
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
uh for this scholarship is there is
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
there I I I have I I got to tell you I
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm behind on reading the underlying
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm leaning on you for this a
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
little bit is there is there no there
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
was not there was not a minimum so it it
 
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:14.119 align:start position:0%
could be someone at the very
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
beginner you know a someone who is a
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
beginner um and would come into a child
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
care center and uh be an assistant or a
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
teacher Aid
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
um this is not just for the teachers
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
this is for a CH any child care provider
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
level so the intent is to offer the
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
scholarships only to people that are
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting into Child Care yes thank you
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
exactly and what what are they doing
 
01:05:55.230 --> 01:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
that requires a scholarship are they
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
they're a child they have a child who
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
needs to go to the word scholarship
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
isn't really the right word a
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
scholarship is a tuition scholarship for
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
the child so that the child can be in
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
child care
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
well in most cases the mother is working
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
in child care okay so when I read
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
scholarship I'm thinking a professional
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
is going to school and needing a
 
01:06:23.069 --> 01:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship this is really a subsidized
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
Child Care fee exactly child
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
Child Care Subsidy is called the child
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
care scholarship program all right all
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the education I
 
01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
understand I understand the confusion F
 
01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
500% of
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
FPL is is what that's like 200,000 isn't
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
it I mean that's a no it no what what
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
what do you think 500% works out to be
 
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
get a family of four was about
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
85 for 500% though
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
um M Ripple can I ask you a trivia
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
question what what would for a family of
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
four are you able to give me a estimate
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
for what 500% of FPL is yes so for a
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
family of four assuming the numbers that
 
01:07:10.829 --> 01:07:10.839 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at are current So based on
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
2024 income numbers family of four the
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level level is 31,200 so
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
500% would be
 
01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
156,000 Say Say That
 
01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.269 align:start position:0%
156,000 Say Say That
160

01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
160
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
156,000 156
 
01:07:32.230 --> 01:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay so so for a family making
 
01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
156,000 we would
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
subsidize Child Care go ahead represent
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
torki I was just going to
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
say for a parent who works in a child
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
care setting so this is like a double
 
01:07:48.789 --> 01:07:48.799 align:start position:0%
incentive program to
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
expand the teachers or the child care
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
providers they can attract workers to
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
come in by doing so say I say you have
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
um a mom who left the work forced to
 
01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
have a child she now has a 2-year-old
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
she needs to go to go back to work she
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
needs child care so that's sort of like
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
a you know it it where can she get
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
affordable child care um well this
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
program would allow her to get a job as
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
a child care provider in a licensed
 
01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
a child care provider in a licensed
professional

01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
setting and she would get a partial um
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
scholarship or the word we could say
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
let's call it um a tuition grant for the
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
child to help pay for that child in
 
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
child care at her employer's office at
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
her employer excuse me yeah so that
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
allows them to open up more spaces for
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
other children let's say I don't know
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
what the ratio is but let's say that
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
allows the center to bring in four more
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
children that allows four more other
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
families to bring their children and it
 
01:08:53.309 --> 01:08:53.319 align:start position:0%
opens up spaces um one of the big
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
challenges we have with our Workforce is
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
people aren't going back to work cuz
 
01:08:59.550 --> 01:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's no spots to put their children
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
in child care so by
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
incentivizing um these jobs by saying
 
01:09:06.789 --> 01:09:06.799 align:start position:0%
you can have this job as a child care
 
01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
provider and we'll give you this you
 
01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
qualify to care for your own child in
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
the program um it's sort of a like a
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
Snowball Effect to help try to attempt
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
to assist the workforce challenges and
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
the child care uh problems we have in
 
01:09:26.749 --> 01:09:26.759 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:09:29.709 --> 01:09:29.719 align:start position:0%
okay great explanation thank you
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
government is really good we can manage
 
01:09:36.030 --> 01:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
all of that I'm sure um so can you tell
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
me is this a a pilot project or is this
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
a permanent
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
program well it this would provide
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
funding to start the program for six
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
months and at the end of the six months
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
we'd be in the budget cycle and I assume
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the department would and it does
 
01:09:58.030 --> 01:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
require still a report the department
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
would report as to how the program is
 
01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
working how many people have been
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
recruited how many people have stayed in
 
01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:07.400 align:start position:0%
the field I mean there'd be a time for
 
01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:10.360 align:start position:0%
Gathering all that kind of information
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
and we would you know like everything
 
01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
else have to come to the budget process
 
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
and look to continue the program or you
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
know maybe not continue it if it hasn't
 
01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:23.630 align:start position:0%
know maybe not continue it if it hasn't
been

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
successful so it um we took out the word
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
pilot because um in the CH special child
 
01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
care committee the word
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
pilot there were members who didn't feel
 
01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
they wanted to call it a pilot so that
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
that part was taken out they didn't like
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
the word or they didn't like the concept
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
no they didn't like the word
 
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
pilot it's my favorite word okay well
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay oh they love those kinds of Pilots
 
01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
but they um so we the word pilot came
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
out the other thing that did get added
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
in the um Child Care committee was um
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Health and Human
 
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
Services would ask the federal
 
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
government for a waiver to allow for
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
this to be funded through federal
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
funds so that's in that's in the bill as
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
it came from the special child care
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee okay so not that you would
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for one but if you were U
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
compelled to to stick your finger on a
 
01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
compelled to to stick your finger on a
Sunset

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
Sunset
 
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:33.640 align:start position:0%
date what what what Sunset date might
 
01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.550 align:start position:0%
date what what what Sunset date might
you

01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
consider well I think it would I think
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
it I think just because of the funding
 
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:44.690 align:start position:0%
it automatically sort of sunsets on June
 
01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:46.990 align:start position:0%
it automatically sort of sunsets on June
[Music]

01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
3025 because
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not funded past that so so
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
this was this was I think I I tried to
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
asked this in an earlier
 
01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
question um is this a is this a pilot or
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
a different word or is this a permanent
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
this is going permanent into the program
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
experiment an
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
experiment um I have no objection
 
01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
personally to the word pilot program
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay okay it was other members of the
 
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:22.600 align:start position:0%
special child care committee that
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
objected to it and it seemed like
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
it it seemed like something not to fight
 
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
about the bill right um because of that
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
one word all right so so you think that
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is clearly an exp a self-expiring
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
program though I do I do and I think it
 
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
it's if it's successful it may make it
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
into the budget it may not be successful
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask Mr Ripple what what
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
do you think because of the funding on
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is this a self-expiring ing program
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
or or are we reading this into permanent
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
law and and therefore the department is
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
going to be obligated to submit a budget
 
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:03.550 align:start position:0%
going to be obligated to submit a budget
for

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:03.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:06.159 align:start position:0%
it go ahead it says the funds are
 
01:13:08.669 --> 01:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
non-lps non laap that ises not apply an
 
01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
endpoint but but when we make a
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
permanent requirement the department
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
gets compelled to submit a budget to
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
cover the things the legislature directs
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
them to do I think and so I just want to
 
01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that the department wouldn't
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
be compelled to submit a budget if uh
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
this a line item for this if uh as
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
written it would enact the program in
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
statute so I think the expectation is
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
that it would be ongoing I think to
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative walner point every
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing Pro uh program is ultimately
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
subject to the budget process so yes the
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
department would include it in its
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget requests but it would be up to
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
the governor and the legislature to
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not to fund it yeah
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay but this program isn't going to
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
have isolated accounting it's going to
 
01:13:59.070 --> 01:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
be buried in all the other lines of
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
accounts and and so is having gone
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
through a couple of budget Cycles I
 
01:14:06.790 --> 01:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that we would have visibility
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
into uh the the the incremental funding
 
01:14:13.709 --> 01:14:13.719 align:start position:0%
that gets associated with this program I
 
01:14:15.310 --> 01:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
I I would feel better about your
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment if we put an explicit Sunset
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
date in it and that way if we like the
 
01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
program uh we can uh reauthorize the
 
01:14:26.189 --> 01:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
program but if we put it in the statute
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're essentially telling the department
 
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:35.229 --> 01:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
requests what do you think I think I
 
01:14:39.149 --> 01:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
think that um if if that's how you would
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with passing this
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation I think
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
that would that would work for me are
 
01:14:49.229 --> 01:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
there are there comments from other
 
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
members I have a question oh I'm sorry I
 
01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
was just going to say go ahead chairman
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
Edwards just so I can understand how
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're viewing this if it has a sunset
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's a pilot
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
um say it for the six months or whatever
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to be um turns out it the
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
department considers it a success and
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
they put it on would they put it on
 
01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
their prioritized requests or would it
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
be upon members to file legislation to
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
then potentially go into the budget so
 
01:15:23.790 --> 01:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
so representative walner and and and wer
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
are better at this than
 
01:15:28.350 --> 01:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
I I would I would think it could be done
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
in one or two ways just as you said and
 
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
two if it if it's a good program the
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
department the governor can come back
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
and ask for it as an hb2 item so either
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
one okay both of my options is that
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
right represent Wallner if if you get
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
involved with Federal
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
funding it's it's that they're not
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
likely to represent to recognize a
 
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
sunset because the federal funding goes
 
01:15:55.590 --> 01:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
through like October you know just
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's the way the federal funds go um
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
if it's looking at some of the things
 
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at for
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
arpa uh Surplus they might be able to
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
get it in and then it would be an
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
automatic Sunset anyway if if the source
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
of funds are arpa but without knowing
 
01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
the source of
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
funds if if we do get federal funds I
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
guess that's theant we don't have much
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
control on it some so so you yeah what
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
if what if the what if HHS got a 2-year
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
Grant after the
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
application you it's hard to say what
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
get okay
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
so so I can't tell exactly are you
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
recommending that we do a sunset or not
 
01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
and based on what you said if you are
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
recommending a sunset then I would do a
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
a 30 September Sunset to coincide with
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
year I don't know as you need a sunset
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
depending on because it's going to be
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
ongoing they're going to be doing the
 
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
report while it's ongoing so they can
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
look at what's going on uh they may not
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
start the report you got your
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
mic so there's going to be a report
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the bill there got to
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
be a report so is this successful is it
 
01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:21.560 align:start position:0%
working is it encouraging people to get
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
into the business um all right so you
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't start until going to be two or 3
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
months before you even get started now
 
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to look at it for
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
two or 3 months and and and they may not
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
get the report done for months after
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
that so it's hard to put a sunset on it
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
just because if you're going after
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
federal funds that's so difficult to
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
predict what what the what the grant
 
01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
predict what what the what the grant
will

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
be I hear you I'm I'm still left to
 
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
think that putting a 30 September 2
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
25 Sunset gets us through this fiscal
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
year and into the next budget
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
cycle yeah it probably wouldn't hurt to
 
01:18:06.590 --> 01:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
get the the federal fund uh Sunset date
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
on that question over here um yes thank
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I so this there's
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
already Child Care scholarships for
 
01:18:16.990 --> 01:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
lower for people within certain income
 
01:18:20.189 --> 01:18:20.199 align:start position:0%
guidelines correct so I'm I'm trying to
 
01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out it seems like there
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
may not be a huge number of childcare
 
01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:27.080 align:start position:0%
workers that don't already qualify I to
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
me it makes more sense to go with what
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney has and then also
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
within that specify that we want to have
 
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
an understanding of how many child care
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
workers already qualify for the current
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
Child Care vouchers and who would then
 
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
qualify for these Child Care vouchers if
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
we were to expand it to everybody
 
01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
working in those centers so to have this
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
um the the report like representative
 
01:18:54.030 --> 01:18:54.040 align:start position:0%
Mooney has but specified that we want to
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
understand the demographic how many
 
01:18:56.910 --> 01:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
people would already qualify with the
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
existing system and how many would then
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
be served by this additional system so
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
so if if if if if you were teed up on
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
this you would you would be recommending
 
01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:09.400 align:start position:0%
the Mooney Amendment and not
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
recommending the wner amendment the
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
Mooney with some additional language to
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
say that the report shall include um an
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
expectation of how many are already
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
covered with the existing programs and
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
how many would be would have would
 
01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
benefit from the expandion coverage I
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
can put that into better words but I I
 
01:19:29.390 --> 01:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
would like to see that so that we can
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
understand as we're discussing this how
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
many people are actually impacted by
 
01:19:35.550 --> 01:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
these additional vouchers okay and and
 
01:19:37.709 --> 01:19:37.719 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney said that the
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
report submission should be 2025 instead
 
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
of 2024 would you would you agree with
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
that um with that I mean it's a matter
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
of just making sure we have the time
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
that we need in order to know what those
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
numbers are and uh whether we're able to
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
collect that I'm I'm I I I think that
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's idea giving some
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
more time for the report makes sense
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
given all the stresses that we have but
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
I think that it's ABS I think it' be
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
really important to know how many people
 
01:20:04.030 --> 01:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
this impacts
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
right okay I well go
 
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
ahead well I think it's going to be
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to know how many people it's
 
01:20:14.110 --> 01:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
going to impact because I mean right now
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
we can I guess the department could
 
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
probably figure
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
out by looking through eligibilities how
 
01:20:23.639 --> 01:20:26.350 align:start position:0%
out by looking through eligibilities how
many

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
come on up and we'll get to you how many
 
01:20:31.229 --> 01:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
people are actually working in child
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
care who are receiving a scholarship now
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
they could probably give us that but
 
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
this is to attract people who aren't in
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
the field now into the field and
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully retaining some that are are
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
there but this is to attract people
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
outside to come in and I don't know that
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
we would be able to say that until we
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
so so what in this language prohibits
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
this the the the tuition
 
01:21:06.110 --> 01:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
assistance um going to people who are
 
01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
already in the
 
01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
field what what what is it
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
that directs this to only new people it
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
it might it might go to people who are
 
01:21:18.669 --> 01:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
already in the field so someone who is
 
01:21:19.870 --> 01:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
working in the
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
field and um finds becomes is pregnant
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
has a baby they may already be there and
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
this is to retain them to hopefully
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
they'll stay in the field and not
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
leave at that point this is to to help
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
us retain our Workforce as well as to um
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
re get new people into it so you know
 
01:21:48.990 --> 01:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
you can't it's a little hard to estimate
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
how many people this might bring in but
 
01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
I do think that that new Futures has
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
done some work in trying to give it the
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
best estimate possible and I think that
 
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:03.560 align:start position:0%
you do have new Futures does have some
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I assume you're from new Futures I
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
am Michelle Meritt president new Futures
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
we did some preliminary analysis on this
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
exact issue um with the department when
 
01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:13.639 align:start position:0%
we were initially working on the bill in
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate and so I do have some numbers
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
um for you that hopefully will give uh
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
some at least like rough estimates of
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
the number of people that would be
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
impacted by this so New Hampshire
 
01:22:26.669 --> 01:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
currently has um
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
5,150 childcare workers who are working
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
um in the state of New Hampshire right
 
01:22:34.629 --> 01:22:34.639 align:start position:0%
now we estimate that there around 7 to
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
800 of those child care workers have
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
children of their own and about 50% of
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
those would be eligible under this um
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
adjustment that would be made because
 
01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
they are part of a two Family household
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
um the goal with this piece of
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is to deter particularly um
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
the worker who average right now they
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
make around 31 to $32,000 a year from
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
exiting the workforce as soon as they
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
have the second or um in some cases
 
01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
their first child where the income
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
equation doesn't make sense anymore um
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
so we are really capturing those that
 
01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
would be over the 85% of the state
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
median income those that are under that
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
um amount that 85% is about half of
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
those currently that have children is
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
what we are
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
estimating so the total number of folks
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
who would be impacted by this is around
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
350 to 400
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
families um thank
 
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
you I have a trivia question for anyone
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
um what is the FPL percentage
 
01:23:44.110 --> 01:23:44.120 align:start position:0%
currently uh for the
 
01:23:47.350 --> 01:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
efas is it 350 I want to say it's 350
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's 350 I believe 350 I think
 
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so so so so the 500% up to
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
156,000 for a family of four sounds like
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
a lot to me but um is there uh
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney do do you have a
 
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
not um well my thought at this point is
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
my Amendment 1859 H could be fleshed out
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
more the suggestions brought out out by
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lon for example would
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
help to do that so I'm almost wondering
 
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
if it since it needs another round
 
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
anyway to include uh the date change if
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps we flesh out some more
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
substantive information for this report
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then take it up after that
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
amendment's been drafted would be my
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
preference okay so I would propose a
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this with representative
 
01:25:00.430 --> 01:25:00.440 align:start position:0%
walner and you and representative Leon
 
01:25:03.310 --> 01:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh to to maybe over lunch when we recess
 
01:25:06.070 --> 01:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
for lunch to see if you guys the three
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
of you that's not a quorum could come up
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
with um a proposal that works for
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
everyone see if we see what we can agree
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
to agree on basically is that
 
01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yes okay all right you I just
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
appointed did you want to be on that
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
sure yes okay all
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
right we're going to set
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
409 uh relative to reimbursement for
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
ambulance services under the State
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plan and and with this you're
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
picking up the clerk ship yes okay do
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
um I I see that representative Stringham
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
you may have uh something you want to
 
01:26:10.590 --> 01:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
say about
 
01:26:14.149 --> 01:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
409 uh sure um I I I think there was an
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to reduce the total
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
expenditure Kevin is that right that was
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
sent around I have an amendment for
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney that would add an
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation essentially for half of a
 
01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
appropriation essentially for half of a
fiscal

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
year thank you um to to address whether
 
01:26:34.350 --> 01:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
that's adequate um is um I could ask uh
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
Mr Litman to maybe step up I know he's
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
here Mr Litman come on
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
down did you want me to hand this
 
01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.109 --> 01:26:51.119 align:start position:0%
yes and with your permission Mr chair
 
01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
can I well I just want to take a look at
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
it okay to get it fresh and then and
 
01:26:58.510 --> 01:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll you can let it
 
01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.870 align:start position:0%
then I'll you can let it
rip

01:27:01.870 --> 01:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
um uh good morning thanks for for
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
joining us happy to thank you um uh
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
before I I ask a few questions you have
 
01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
anything you kind of want to say about
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh the adequacy or what you need for
 
01:27:19.709 --> 01:27:19.719 align:start position:0%
this policy for this bill sure um so I
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
think that um the the purpose of this
 
01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
bill is to address the the costs that um
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
ambulance companies and municipalities
 
01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
that have contracts with um ambulance
 
01:27:36.910 --> 01:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
companies or fire Services of
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
communities that um when an ambulance
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
goes out and makes a call and they don't
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
end up doing a transport there's no
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement um and um what uh we don't
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
want to like pay for a coffee run right
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
but we would if someone is where they
 
01:28:00.189 --> 01:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
can render a service that helps prevent
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
someone from having to enter an
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
emergency room um those are kind of
 
01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
things I think we want to um incentivize
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
because they're good for the system when
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
we testified in the senate about this um
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to need uh criteria
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
to to approach CMS with to be able to
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
show that the types of things we're
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for are are services that
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
um are providing intervention that's
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
something medical not just for driving
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere and so um you know I think
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:28:36.189 --> 01:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
uh we need we'll need to do some work
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
with CMS so I think a half a year
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation would probably be the time
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
frame we would need anyways to to maybe
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
work through those items I also you know
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
in the Senate testified that um you
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
could May and it may still be in there
 
01:28:51.830 --> 01:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
and didn't make it over from the Senate
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
was you could place a contingency on it
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
that the appropriation be contingency on
 
01:28:58.030 --> 01:28:58.040 align:start position:0%
getting the state plan Amendment
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
approved because we shouldn't do go
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
forward with this if there's not going
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
to be a federal match um but I think in
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
terms of working with the appropriation
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's in here that's something we can
 
01:29:13.310 --> 01:29:13.320 align:start position:0%
work with um and you know measure the
 
01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:15.560 align:start position:0%
timing U to the
 
01:29:18.910 --> 01:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation I that's helpful um go
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
ahead uh specifically um you know a lot
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
of ambulance services
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
are paid there's a there's a a billing
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
event or a code what they call hick piix
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
code for what's actually done and then
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's a separate hicp code for uh
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
mileage um would your and and there is a
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
hicp code I notice a998 ambulance
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
response and treatment no transport
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
which is currently non-billable correct
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
um do you think that that uh code would
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
be a
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate and how often do you think
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
it would be build in the state and if if
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
payable what would you set as the
 
01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:04.639 align:start position:0%
initial rate yeah what's really hard
 
01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
about this one is we have no experience
 
01:30:10.669 --> 01:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
to necessarily build it off of um so I
 
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:12.760 align:start position:0%
think you know in conversation we had
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
offline I think you know trying to get
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
some experience which would help us you
 
01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
know build a budget you know work with
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
you on the the next uh budget would be
 
01:30:24.430 --> 01:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
an appropriate place to start I think
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
part of what codes we would use would be
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
uh determined by our interaction with
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
CMS on on the state plan Amendment this
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
is not a slam dunk uh in terms of U
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
getting an approval um so we'd have to
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
probably meet the conditions that that
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
they would feel comfortable with to make
 
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
sure it's not paying for things that
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
aren't providing a medical impact so
 
01:30:50.910 --> 01:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
what I think I'm picking up is that
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
there isn't a billing code for what
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
we're proposing and that there may not
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
be approval by CMS if we direct this uh
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
the department to do this I think
 
01:31:01.870 --> 01:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
everything except the very first point
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
there there is a code for for that's
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
non-billable today but there is a there
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
is a code to that okay there is a code
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's just not reimbursable correct okay
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
so working with CMS they could say yes
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
you can reimburse that and we can match
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
it or they may not say that right they
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
they they may that is very well could be
 
01:31:26.350 --> 01:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
the case so they could say under these
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
certain conditions we would do it you
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
know and so I think that that's what I
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen like they may
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
say for you know a a cardiac condition
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
they may say for you know these types of
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
things that where they feel it's a um a
 
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
beneficial aspect for the cost and and
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
health of the the program so so what I'm
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
what I'm concluding uh is that the the
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
language that you've proposed
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
or Mooney I guess Mooney has proposed uh
 
01:32:01.590 --> 01:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
that maybe we need to um include some
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
language that makes it this program that
 
01:32:08.430 --> 01:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
we're mandating be contingent upon
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
receipt of federal funds Federal
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
approval yeah I I guess I have kind of
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
another thought because I'm really
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that um we don't we don't
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
understand what this could grow into
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't understand what the f
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
level will be or what the utilization
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
level will be um you know I was part of
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
the ambulance um um you know special
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
committee that um U uh Mr bonc Court uh
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
held last summer and you know uh a year
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
ago when we were here ambulance
 
01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:45.320 align:start position:0%
companies were dropping like flies and
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
going out of business some of them would
 
01:32:50.990 --> 01:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
been in business for for decades and um
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh that was part of the reason why we
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
did what we did with a budget budget
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is all new
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
money because we're not talking about
 
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the payment for any other
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
Ambulance Service under
 
01:33:06.189 --> 01:33:06.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid um but you know we don't I I
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
personally don't know whether we're
 
01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
looking at thousands of service tens of
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
thousands of service or 100 thousands of
 
01:33:15.149 --> 01:33:15.159 align:start position:0%
services I'm hearing as many as
 
01:33:18.590 --> 01:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
30% of the calls that ambulances are
 
01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
taking are non-billable they go there
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
they give somebody narom
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
Nar Naran they save their life and they
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
say you know what I'm fine and they
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
drive home and they get zero right and
 
01:33:36.990 --> 01:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
um um so this may be helpful I I I gener
 
01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
I I agree with the idea that if an
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
ambulance gets called out and they do
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of medical intervention
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
whether they transport somebody to a
 
01:33:49.629 --> 01:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
hospital or to another Care Facility
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
should be kind of irrelevant because
 
01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
they've taken a resource that they've
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
invested in out of other service and
 
01:33:59.550 --> 01:33:59.560 align:start position:0%
they're doing this service I I think
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
just as a matter of
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
fairness allowing some reimbursement for
 
01:34:06.830 --> 01:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
that whether I'm not talking about the
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
dollar amount for the reimbursement or
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
any of that but just as a matter of
 
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
fairness I think they ought to be able
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
to get some money for that and so so so
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
given that I I just want to make sure
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
that we do this in a way in which we
 
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:28.280 align:start position:0%
do this program if we get Federal money
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
to match with our general funds I I
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to create a program where
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
we're just doing this component with
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
General funds only is
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
what is it the the yes well how is how
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
is it in the contingent upon getting the
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
federal approval is is in the
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
bill right I I think the contingency
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
language on lines 25 through 27 of the
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh of the bill covers that all right so
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
that addresses my
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
concern so
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
um what you know what I'm wondering is
 
01:35:06.470 --> 01:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
just getting started is how you set the
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
initial rate what are you going to ask
 
01:35:10.590 --> 01:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
for uh are you going to ask for both
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
mileage and the other code is there
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
anything that that can be done that we
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
need to activate in this in this uh bill
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
that helps us understand what kind of
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
what level of utilization
 
01:35:25.590 --> 01:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be need so we know
 
01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
whether you know we're looking at you
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
know a million dollars of general fund
 
01:35:32.070 --> 01:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation next cycle or perhaps
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
something substantially higher yeah uh
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
and and it
 
01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
um this this fee doesn't necessarily
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
have to cover the entire cost it's all
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
new money for the ambulance
 
01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
services so um um you know with with
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
that in mind that that's that's what I
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to miss the opportunity here
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
with this bill to be in a better
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
position to have an accurate um
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation next
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
cycle I think what will will drive that
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
development is looking at the the
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
conditions when I say conditions medical
 
01:36:12.790 --> 01:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
conditions that um we would be covering
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
and then doing some projected
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
utilization estimates and working with
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
the the field that's out there to get
 
01:36:22.750 --> 01:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
some sense of that as well um you know
 
01:36:24.790 --> 01:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
to work within the budget that is
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
provided and then get some experience
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
and look at the success of the program
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
both um in the human context in terms of
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
the example you use of Naran being
 
01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
administered or or in other ways in
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
terms of Municipal budgets and and uh
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
you know the ability you know the
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
ambulance service situation was
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
definitely you know the the
 
01:36:51.030 --> 01:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation that was made um in hb2 I
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
think has made a big difference um
 
01:36:56.270 --> 01:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's still stress out there um and I
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to say that that was The Cure
 
01:37:01.229 --> 01:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
but I also think that know as chairman
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
said that I think it's fair to to
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
provide some compensation when you're
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
providing a a service of real value so
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
so to keep this rolling uh
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham is there based
 
01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
on the me hearing your concern I just
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
want to know would you propose any
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
additional or different language to the
 
01:37:22.629 --> 01:37:22.639 align:start position:0%
Mooney Amendment or are you comfortable
 
01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know I just want to make sure you
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility that that you need
 
01:37:32.239 --> 01:37:33.430 align:start position:0%
have the flexibility that that you need
to

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
um um to be interacting with the
 
01:37:38.510 --> 01:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
ambulance services providers preferably
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see them be submitting
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
claims as soon as possible even if they
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
don't pay or they pay a dollar provided
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
that doesn't put you in a bad spot with
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
negotiating the CMS
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
contracts and you know go ahead we've
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
had a good um interaction with the
 
01:37:57.790 --> 01:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
ambulance providers some of the major
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
providers and um feel very comfortable
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you know we can engage with them to
 
01:38:05.149 --> 01:38:05.159 align:start position:0%
to get some information to help inform
 
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:08.560 align:start position:0%
it better both um from a financial
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint but also from a CMS approval
 
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint um I I appreciate the
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
amendment here and I think the bill is
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
structured with this amendment it gives
 
01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
us enough flexibility to to to get
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
something done that would be
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
useful okay um do you think they would
 
01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:30.159 align:start position:0%
be able to uh submit claims that are
 
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
non-p payable or payable of a nominal
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
amount just so they start coming in I
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
think the coding language is pretty good
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
for what the bill defines and I know one
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
of our major providers in the state
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
sitting back here probably could comment
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
whether they could pay for reporting I
 
01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
mean excuse me um do reporting where
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
there's no payment to to help us with
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
that but I suspect that that answer
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
would be yes but I want don't want to
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
them so would you like another witness
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
or are you ready to tell me if you would
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
change any words in this amendment
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
whoever that is I would like to hear
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
that would be great okay before he
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
leaves and and then I'll move on all
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
right because that's the bottom line we
 
01:39:14.830 --> 01:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
we got an amendment if this amendment is
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
good it's good if if we need to change
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
the words then we should say that okay
 
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
thanks go ahead hi for the record Chris
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
day was holl Hampshire I'm a board
 
01:39:26.189 --> 01:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
member of New Hampshire Ambulance
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
Association I'm uh also work for
 
01:39:30.750 --> 01:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
American Medical
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
Response yeah so um uh you know in
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
advance of CMS uh approving anything um
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
how how do we get an idea of how how
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
extensively these codes would be used
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
and if you have any idea what an uh you
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
know a fair appropriation would be per
 
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
unit of
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
service um there are actually a number
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
of states that are either um in the
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
process of developing similar
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
legislation or have successfully passed
 
01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
similar legislation in the last couple
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
of years uh so I would say that there
 
01:40:10.149 --> 01:40:10.159 align:start position:0%
are plenty of um opportunities for New
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid to um collaborate
 
01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
with other Medicaid from different
 
01:40:16.350 --> 01:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
states to see what their utilization
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
would be I actually think and this is
 
01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:21.639 align:start position:0%
just based on my experience I've been
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
doing this for 40 years here in New
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that the half million doll
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
allocation would be more than enough for
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
probably significantly more than
 
01:40:36.589 --> 01:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
enough our goal um is not to be
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for every trip that we go on
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
where a transport does not occur it's
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
only for ones where it's medically
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so a a pretty significant
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
service would be provided um the the
 
01:40:53.709 --> 01:40:53.719 align:start position:0%
Naran um example is is a great example
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
there are other examples such as a
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest where typically a large
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
amount of um uh medications and supplies
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
are used and the individual may be
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
deceased at the scene and not
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
transported so there's no reimbursement
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
for that um and and also keep in mind
 
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
that this would only apply to Medicaid
 
01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
primary Insurance patients so it
 
01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be um anybody who's not
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
currently receiving Medicaid and that
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
narrows the scope of the indiv idual who
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
would be uh subject to this as
 
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
well additionally um there are
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
commercial insurance providers Anthem is
 
01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:33.880 align:start position:0%
one in New Hampshire that already has a
 
01:41:36.669 --> 01:41:36.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursement method for this this uh
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
particular service so they recognize
 
01:41:41.470 --> 01:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
that um keeping people out of the
 
01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms is actually a cost
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
savings at the end of the day and I'll
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
use one more example of a diabetic
 
01:41:50.910 --> 01:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
person who we may respond to um they may
 
01:41:53.709 --> 01:41:53.719 align:start position:0%
be hypoglycemic have low sugar we treat
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
them on the scene get their sugar back
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
to normal and then they don't need to go
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
to the hospital so they've saved that
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
that emergency room visit not only
 
01:42:03.470 --> 01:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
financially but um from a personal
 
01:42:05.189 --> 01:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
standpoint it's probably the last place
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
you want to be nowadays um and you're
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
getting the care that you that you um
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
need in the right place at the right
 
01:42:14.830 --> 01:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
method and and uh you have any idea what
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
the commercial rates are and is it they
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
pay for Trans for Mileage Plus
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh the service event or just one um
 
01:42:28.629 --> 01:42:28.639 align:start position:0%
there's no mileage because there's no
 
01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
transport in in the states that I have
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
seen it successfully implemented what
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
they typically do is um use a either a
 
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
Medicare base rate or some type of
 
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
multiplier of that um but it's generally
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know several hundred dollar uh in in
 
01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement thank
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
you so so Henry you think you have you
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
have enough to be able to um
 
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
kind of faired out what we'd be looking
 
01:42:58.669 --> 01:42:58.679 align:start position:0%
at next budget cycle I think we I think
 
01:43:01.629 --> 01:43:01.639 align:start position:0%
we would and I you know in terms of um I
 
01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:03.320 align:start position:0%
am familiar that there are some states
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
out there I haveen not had the chance to
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know interact with them I I'll
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
probably have a chance that once I know
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
what the states are um in June I'm going
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
to a national meeting of of the Medicaid
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
directors I can tap into them at that
 
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
point they're usually very generous
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
about sharing
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
information I guess I guess Mr chair my
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
feeling is there's nothing canect add to
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
the Bild either make Henry's job easier
 
01:43:29.229 --> 01:43:29.239 align:start position:0%
or our job easier at next cycle um but
 
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I strongly support going
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
forward with it so all right uh trivia
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
question for you Mr Ripple uh is this
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
assumed to be uh lapsing this
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
500,000 right if it doesn't say anything
 
01:43:44.669 --> 01:43:44.679 align:start position:0%
it would lapse at the end of the bium
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
okay so the default is that it lapses
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay and uh I I didn't catch
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
your name because I'm hard at hearing
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
but but you you just said we don't need
 
01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
500,000 we need
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
250,000 you don't know that you said
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
that but that's what I heard what what
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
what do you really think we
 
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
need you know truthfully I'd be throwing
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
a dart at the board uh I think 500,000
 
01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
is a good starting point but I you learn
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
fast yeah it's a culture change it's not
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
something it's not information that that
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
most uh providers even collect right now
 
01:44:25.750 --> 01:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
I I I hear you thank you for answering a
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous question um do you have a
 
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
motion yes I would like to move the
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
adoption of amendment number 1862 H to
 
01:44:39.070 --> 01:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
409 second second okay so since this is
 
01:44:47.189 --> 01:44:47.199 align:start position:0%
an amendment uh show hands all those in
 
01:44:50.669 --> 01:44:50.679 align:start position:0%
favor those opposed saying so no one
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
opposed that's what nine to nothing m
 
01:44:57.109 --> 01:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
all right so so now we go on uh to we
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
need another motion I think of
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
otpa is there a motion yeah Jerry motion
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%

through 4:17 before we break for lunch
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh so hopefully that's the carrot
 
01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:25.960 align:start position:0%
um now for 17 I should point out that
 
01:46:29.189 --> 01:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative Hull uh had asked since
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
he couldn't be here today that we
 
01:46:36.350 --> 01:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
postpone the final determination on the
 
01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee position until Monday so that
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
he so that we could have another work
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
session and have him involved Mr Ripple
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
pointed out that as a as a matter of
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
procedure I could just reset us 4117 and
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
reschedule us to come back on
 
01:47:02.709 --> 01:47:02.719 align:start position:0%
Monday problem with that is we have a
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon with the full finance
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm I'm completely out of
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
the net on on the morning on a
 
01:47:10.679 --> 01:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
the net on on the morning on a
long-standing

01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
long-standing
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
obligation so so it's really not
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
particularly feasible for me to do it
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
but I could ask for a replacement if I
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
needed um if we can get to a pretty
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
solid spot on
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
4177 I I I think I'd be comfortable just
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
closing it out today um and and and
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
explain it to representative
 
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
H um okay so 417 relative to out of home
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%

01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
hoping to have handed out today in his
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%

basic

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.629 --> 01:49:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%

21 not been charged with abuse Mike you

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
mic thank
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
you where it said a parent who has not
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
been charged with abuse or neglect shall
 
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
be fored upon request a full Hearing in
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
the district of family court regarding
 
01:49:59.709 --> 01:49:59.719 align:start position:0%
his or her ability to contain custom
 
01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
to a parent who has not been charged
 
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
with abuse or neglect shall be deemed a
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
fit parent this may be challenged with a
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
full Hearing in the district of family
 
01:50:16.470 --> 01:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
court regarding his or her ability so
 
01:50:17.790 --> 01:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
that it seemed like there was an
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
assumption of guilt before you're even
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
questioned so that that was the change
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
and the next one
 
01:50:28.550 --> 01:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
was that's a big one I agree with your
 
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
principle there innocent until proven
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
guilty kind of thing yeah uh who
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
challenges who has the authority to
 
01:50:38.910 --> 01:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
challenge I guess
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
anybody is that is that what we want is
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
that anybody can challenge I mean what
 
01:50:46.069 --> 01:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
would stop
 
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
um a shop operation where every one of
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
them gets challenged and still
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
accomplishes what the original original
 
01:50:56.589 --> 01:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
Bill said by other means should should
 
01:51:00.350 --> 01:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have some sort of definition you
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
think or or or not
 
01:51:06.589 --> 01:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
about scoping who gets the challenge the
 
01:51:08.629 --> 01:51:08.639 align:start position:0%
definition is there parent who's not
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
been charged with abuse or neglect shall
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
be deemed a fit parent may be challenged
 
01:51:19.870 --> 01:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:25.950 --> 01:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so so my my why don't you
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
continue and we'll come back to that all
 
01:51:39.390 --> 01:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:51:48.990 --> 01:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:50.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
the unique needs of the child and
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not the parent is adequately
 
01:52:02.030 --> 01:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
prepared and re re uh lettered the rest
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
and added on after the end of what is
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
here G but then in the amendment is
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
f the fact that a parent owns a firearm
 
01:52:13.790 --> 01:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
shall not make a home unsafe which line
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
is that the the firearm on on it's the
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
last it's 26 and 27 in the amendment but
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
it would it would go at the end of uh
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
line 15 on the second
 
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.589 align:start position:0%
line 15 on the second
page

01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:52:29.599 --> 01:52:31.229 align:start position:0%
page
yep

01:52:31.229 --> 01:52:31.239 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
and what is your motivation for wanting
 
01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
to insert lines 12 through 27 into the
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
original Bill what what what what was
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:52.750 --> 01:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
language go ahead represent money thank
 
01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair as I recall the discussion
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
on page two of the original Bill line
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
three there's a line that reads the
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
unique needs of the child and whether or
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
not the parent is adequately prepared to
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
address those needs I believe the wer
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment removes that language I said
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
that and then moves the rest up and re
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
let us the rest okay and it adds the the
 
01:53:23.550 --> 01:53:23.560 align:start position:0%
weapon it adds the you know the firearm
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
should not make a home up unsafe yeah
 
01:53:28.350 --> 01:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
okay no I understand
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:58.589 --> 01:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
all right uh the the division uh Vice
 
01:54:01.870 --> 01:54:01.880 align:start position:0%
chair chaired the first work session
 
01:54:04.990 --> 01:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
earlier this week and she recommends and
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
I agree with her recommendation that we
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
we um
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh hold off on 4177 for now uh and go
 
01:54:15.199 --> 01:54:16.310 align:start position:0%
uh hold off on 4177 for now uh and go
into

01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
455 do we want to look at the other
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment not not just yet we're going
 
01:54:22.510 --> 01:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
to hold off on 417 we're gonna we're
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
going to knock out 455 because Mr Litman
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
is here if we get done with 4555 he can
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
go um and I wasn't going to do 455
 
01:54:34.669 --> 01:54:34.679 align:start position:0%
before breaking for lunch but now we're
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
we're just changing the order for the
 
01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
convenience of Mr
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
lman good um yeah all right so so this
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
is all for you Mr Litman don't say we
 
01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:48.719 align:start position:0%
never did anything for you all right so
 
01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to uh bring up uh sp sp 455
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
relative to Medicaid reimbursement rates
 
01:55:06.990 --> 01:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.629 --> 01:55:09.639 align:start position:0%
devices um just like to thank you again
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
hry Litman for the record uh State's
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director I think this bill
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
originates out of um what's happened
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
historically in the Dural medical
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
equipment environment um
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
back in 200 um 19 when we did the last
 
01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
uh procurement of the Managed Care
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
Program we heard a lot from um the
 
01:55:36.910 --> 01:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
smaller Dural medical equipment
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
providers in New Hampshire um what was
 
01:55:44.109 --> 01:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
happening in the contract is uh the mcos
 
01:55:45.870 --> 01:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
were able to because of the
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
commoditization of a lot of products
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
were able to drive down um reimbursement
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
below low um the Medicaid fee schedule
 
01:55:57.390 --> 01:55:57.400 align:start position:0%
um somewhere sometimes as low as like
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
60% of the Medicaid fee schedule and um
 
01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:02.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we reached all parts
 
01:56:07.149 --> 01:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
of the state um we added $3 million to
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
the contract at that point to bring up
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
to create a floor of 80% of Medicaid fee
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
schedule for those products and the the
 
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
rationale being is that you know you can
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
make money easier in the urban areas and
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
not the the rural areas and so um I
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
think that um the smaller providers have
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh approached the Senate uh I think sen
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
Apprentice to begin with about um trying
 
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
to move that up that floor from 80% of
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid fees scheduled to 100% I
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
think there was a a compromise due to
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
all the competing priorities to look to
 
01:56:49.510 --> 01:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
make some gain in this legislative
 
01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
session to 90% um
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
and um I do think that you know in terms
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
of making sure that we if there is an
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation available that um you know
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
providing some additional relief to our
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
smaller providers and being able to make
 
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:08.320 align:start position:0%
sure we serve the whole state well is uh
 
01:57:11.629 --> 01:57:11.639 align:start position:0%
a worthwhile um appropriation for the
 
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
state to
 
01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:16.639 align:start position:0%
make thank you for that I I my note says
 
01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham has something
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
to say and then we'll go to you
 
01:57:24.069 --> 01:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative yes so uh the the problem
 
01:57:27.750 --> 01:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're U that brought this bill uh to
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
our attention or to your Senate's
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
attention is that rural access because
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
of low Medicaid payments for things that
 
01:57:38.430 --> 01:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
fall under this benefit category are too
 
01:57:42.189 --> 01:57:42.199 align:start position:0%
low um and um the proposed solution is
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
to in increase uh this floor payment for
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
the entire state is that right correct
 
01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:52.639 align:start position:0%
is there any um current program um
 
01:57:52.639 --> 01:57:53.510 align:start position:0%
is there any um current program um
uh

01:57:53.510 --> 01:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
for uh a higher payment in rural in
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
rural areas or small providers or has
 
01:58:02.189 --> 01:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
that been tried before is that something
 
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's worth considering if not here in
 
01:58:08.270 --> 01:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
the future um I I think that you know
 
01:58:11.030 --> 01:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
when you talk about rural um differences
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
I think there's like the the far Rural
 
01:58:15.870 --> 01:58:15.880 align:start position:0%
right and then there's you know you go
 
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:18.040 align:start position:0%
3040 miles outside of Manchester you get
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
pretty Ru sometimes too um I think
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
generally New Hampshire in in many in
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
many ways that
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
um there aren't there aren't significant
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
cost differences in in serving um uh but
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
when you're having to to travel to to
 
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
put this in there's I guess the the
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism if you were to do something
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
different would be to provide a
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
different travel allowance but I think
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
that ends up complicating it where do
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
you draw the line um I think that um you
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
know the the most predictable way for us
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
to to to move in this direction is just
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
to to maintain a feast schedule and not
 
01:58:59.470 --> 01:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
get into you know where do you draw the
 
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
line on on travel time and and and what
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
have you and we do have such a
 
01:59:07.750 --> 01:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
distinction in ambulances for example
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
yep and so they've had to had to address
 
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
that at some point
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
and uh one side of the street I'm sure
 
01:59:17.310 --> 01:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere is one Rural and across the
 
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
street is less
 
01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
R the middle group there's three and
 
01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.629 align:start position:0%
R the middle group there's three and
ambulances

01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
ambulances
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
um uh the the list of of uh products and
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
and services that you sent were all with
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
L codes is this um um Bill limited to
 
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
things like scoliosis braces and um uh
 
01:59:42.069 --> 01:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
the things that normally fall under L
 
01:59:46.390 --> 01:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
codes or does it does it cover uh other
 
01:59:49.470 --> 01:59:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh types of services it's it's targeted
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
at I think the the devices that are
 
01:59:52.629 --> 01:59:52.639 align:start position:0%
applied to people
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
um and pain pumps um but those
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
are um K codes are other things too so
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not an expert on this part of
 
02:00:08.790 --> 02:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
the the coding I worked with my team in
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
terms of what what it would be applied
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
to um I can reconfirm that if if you
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
feel that I need to um well I just want
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure the appropriation is right
 
02:00:20.750 --> 02:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
for the services that we intend to we
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
did the appropriation that in the bill
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
that came over from the Senate we work
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
with our actuary in terms of
 
02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:28.990 align:start position:0%
with our actuary in terms of
developing

02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
developing
 
02:00:31.149 --> 02:00:31.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
you okay so do do you do you think you
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
have an amendment you'd want to propose
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
based on that conversation doesn't sound
 
02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
like it no this is I think you know as
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
long as the appropriation is correct and
 
02:00:44.830 --> 02:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
that was the com Communications we've
 
02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:48.679 align:start position:0%
had over the last few days um um I
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
support support this bill all right
 
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Lipman um I
 
02:00:57.310 --> 02:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
have heard talk of it as a floor but the
 
02:00:59.069 --> 02:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
language reads um so that the
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate for prostetic and
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
orthotic devices under Medicaid so that
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
it is equal to 90% of the reimbursement
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
rate under Medicare is that the correct
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
language or do we need different
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
language for that to be a floor um you
 
02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
you may raise a good point there I think
 
02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:16.679 align:start position:0%
that we have the Medicaid fee schedule
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that we what we're doing here is
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
creating the floor um that' be no less
 
02:01:26.109 --> 02:01:26.119 align:start position:0%
than 90% so I we may want to um make
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
that clear based on what you're you're
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
raising and then is a followup um I
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
guess on the follow-up would be to make
 
02:01:34.069 --> 02:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
sure that the appropriation is still
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
correct um given that that's should be
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
that if that's intended to be a floor as
 
02:01:41.310 --> 02:01:41.320 align:start position:0%
opposed to a cap I'm I'm confident that
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
the appropriation reflected the that we
 
02:01:45.470 --> 02:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
were adding because we we approached it
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
the same way as when we went from no
 
02:01:49.950 --> 02:01:49.960 align:start position:0%
floor to 80% so I'm I'm confident about
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
the appropriation component thank you
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah just as clarification
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's 90% of the Medicaid fee schedule so
 
02:02:01.229 --> 02:02:01.239 align:start position:0%
at some point there I guess we were
 
02:02:03.189 --> 02:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
paying 100% of the Medicaid fee
 
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled no no I think um well under
 
02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Managed Care Program the the manag
 
02:02:12.149 --> 02:02:12.159 align:start position:0%
Care organizations were using their
 
02:02:14.589 --> 02:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
leverage based on National buying power
 
02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
to push the rates far below the Medicaid
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
fee schedule um and that that's the
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
issue that this bill is trying to
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
address is to make sure that rates
 
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:25.800 align:start position:0%
aren't driven so low that you know that
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
where they're willing to serve is is
 
02:02:31.390 --> 02:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
constrained thank
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
you it appears we're ready for a motion
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
455 yeah I I move a to
 
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
pass you need an
 
02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I I didn't think there was an
 
02:02:45.870 --> 02:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to this is there an amendment
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
to 455 there is no Amendment uh Mr
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
Litman has ju just suggested based on
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon's question changing
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
the language equal to 90% to something
 
02:02:57.790 --> 02:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
like no less than 90% of the Medicaid P
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
schedule so you're you're wanting that
 
02:03:02.189 --> 02:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment um if the uh Mr chairman if
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
the intention is to move the floor from
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
80% to 90% as opposed to having a set
 
02:03:09.950 --> 02:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
rate at 90% that I think we would need
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
to change the language so that the
 
02:03:13.109 --> 02:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
language suggests a floor because in the
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note there's a mention that right
 
02:03:17.350 --> 02:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
now it would cap it and that would hurt
 
02:03:19.310 --> 02:03:19.320 align:start position:0%
some of the fee for service under some
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the managed agreements okay
 
02:03:24.030 --> 02:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't know how to deal with this
 
02:03:26.310 --> 02:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
in policy so Mr Ripple since you're
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
going to create the amendment what what
 
02:03:30.750 --> 02:03:30.760 align:start position:0%
do you think the amendment's going to
 
02:03:33.629 --> 02:03:33.639 align:start position:0%
do well I would simply add the words no
 
02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
less than on lines three and 16 so that
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
it reads so that it is equal to no less
 
02:03:41.030 --> 02:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
than 90% of the reimbursement rate under
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Medicare I'm sorry okay does
 
02:03:47.629 --> 02:03:47.639 align:start position:0%
does does everyone on division three
 
02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
understand what that Amendment would
 
02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:50.350 align:start position:0%
understand what that Amendment would
look

02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
look
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
like is there any uh
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement I'm I'm is it Medic or
 
02:03:59.069 --> 02:03:59.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that's what we're it should be
 
02:04:07.629 --> 02:04:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
scheduled all right so so we've done
 
02:04:13.750 --> 02:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
this before where we've taken votes on
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
amendments that we that have not yet
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
been drafted and then we've reserved the
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
right before the next during the next
 
02:04:24.870 --> 02:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
next meeting to to VA validate that the
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
amendment comes out the way we think it
 
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
should come out we've done this
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
before question I'm sorry sorry I just I
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
want to double check with Mr Lipman um
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
on line four of the bill it actually
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
refers to Medicare and not Medicaid yeah
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
so the way the the current um program
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
works at it's 80 it's it's a floor
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
described with representative lay on
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's 80% of the
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fee schedule and what we're
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
looking to do is move that up to 90%
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
correct however on the bill it actually
 
02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
says the reimbursement rate under
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare yes are we talking about
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare here no I think that the the
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation and um as we base it off
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid fee schedule um so I think
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
that the the proponents of this who may
 
02:05:24.189 --> 02:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
have come forward may have looking for
 
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
90% of Medicare but it's it would be 90%
 
02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
of our Medicaid P okay so this is just a
 
02:05:32.549 --> 02:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
typo and we need to change Medicare to
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid yes okay that's what I was
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get at no no that's that's a
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
good catch do you have that Mr rle I do
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if if it should if
 
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as replacing uh Medicare
 
02:05:46.149 --> 02:05:46.159 align:start position:0%
with Medicaid or if it should say no
 
02:05:49.390 --> 02:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
less than 90% of
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement rate under the the
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fee
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
schedule but I've asked Mr Litman to
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
write out how he believes It should read
 
02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
so we'll get the uh we'll get the line
 
02:06:02.589 --> 02:06:02.599 align:start position:0%
12 also refers to Medicare so that would
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
okay in line 17 thank
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr Litman the if it's okay go ahead
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
in the line of business Med New
 
02:06:19.549 --> 02:06:19.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medicaid um pricing amount
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
that pricing amount is based on 100% of
 
02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid right is that the table you
 
02:06:28.629 --> 02:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
sent me um the the fee schedule I gave
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
you is the actual Medicaid fee schedules
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
so that's 100% of the Medicaid fee
 
02:06:35.549 --> 02:06:35.559 align:start position:0%
schedule and right now the floor is
 
02:06:38.830 --> 02:06:38.840 align:start position:0%
80% the Ste yeah floor is 80% of this
 
02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:39.910 align:start position:0%
80% the Ste yeah floor is 80% of this
amount

02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
amount
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
correct you
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
know yes okay that's a good catch so Mr
 
02:06:48.149 --> 02:06:48.159 align:start position:0%
Ripple I want to make sure everyone
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
understands what we think we want to do
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
restate I I yes I can I am waiting for
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
Mr Litman to provide his exact language
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
but we're changing the 90% to no less
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
than 90% And the reference to Medicare
 
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
is being changed to Medicaid although I
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
don't know what the exact language of
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
that will
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
be okay so there's some flexibility in
 
02:07:13.709 --> 02:07:13.719 align:start position:0%
there is there anyone on the division
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
that is uh uncomfortable with the fact
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
that we're he's got to fine-tune this
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative wner
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
thanks I just
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
wondered um asking Mr Litman when the in
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
the Senate hearings about this did the
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors actually mean Medicare I I
 
02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
think the the proponents may have been
 
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
looking for Medicare but I think in
 
02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the the the um the fiscal note
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
that we prepared is you know we base it
 
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
we base it off off our own fee schedule
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
and that's you know that would be
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
implementing something completely
 
02:07:56.109 --> 02:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
different and great go ahead and
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates are higher than Medicaid
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
rates Medicare rates are higher in fact
 
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
um there's some technical things in
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
terms of that when we um we have to stay
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
with actually below the Medicare fee
 
02:08:11.870 --> 02:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
schedules on certain aspects of D
 
02:08:13.629 --> 02:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
durable medical
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
equipment thank you represent torki did
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
something no I was the basic question is
 
02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable with having us craft
 
02:08:29.549 --> 02:08:29.559 align:start position:0%
an amendment that we want to accept upon
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
validation that it was written
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
right I am comfortable I was just going
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
to point out just to make sure that on
 
02:08:39.709 --> 02:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
line 12 it's not a direct cut and paste
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
of Medicare to Medicaid because it lists
 
02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
both programs online 12 to 13 so yes I'm
 
02:08:48.109 --> 02:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
sure Mr litman's language change is
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
going to be way more accurate than what
 
02:08:53.109 --> 02:08:53.119 align:start position:0%
I could provide
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
okay you were all over
 
02:08:59.870 --> 02:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
this so uh so go ahead representative
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
way on and Mr chairman the policy intent
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
from Health and Human Services was to
 
02:09:06.750 --> 02:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
move from 80% to 90% however it's
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
supposed to be written for the money to
 
02:09:10.470 --> 02:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
work correctly so policy-wise in the
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
house the intention was just to pay
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
increase that from 80% to 90% the right
 
02:09:19.229 --> 02:09:19.239 align:start position:0%
way okay so so given that Mr Ripple is
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
going to create an amendment and that we
 
02:09:26.189 --> 02:09:26.199 align:start position:0%
should be able to see it before the full
 
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
Finance on
 
02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.870 align:start position:0%
Finance on
Monday

02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
um can I get a show of hands on how many
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
are in favor of the amendment that we've
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.510 --> 02:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
described all right so so with that did
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
you have something did I stop you from
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
saying something the only thing I was
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
going to mention earlier uh in the
 
02:09:53.069 --> 02:09:53.079 align:start position:0%
context of the appropriation and whether
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
it was sufficient is that as currently
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
drafted uh this is an open warrant so
 
02:09:59.549 --> 02:09:59.559 align:start position:0%
it's whatever the cost ends up being uh
 
02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
that amount amount is appropriated I
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's the committee's
 
02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
desire or not um you could leave it that
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
way or you could put a specific amount
 
02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:08.310 align:start position:0%
way or you could put a specific amount
in

02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
here do do we have a reasonable estimate
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
because it makes sense that we shouldn't
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
be writing blank checks the estimate in
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note was 620,000 in general
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
funds for fiscal
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
25 so so do we need to put an
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation line or something in there
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
if the committee were so inclined yeah
 
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
you could change the language to an
 
02:10:30.709 --> 02:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 620,000 and I could add
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
the department shall be authorized to
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
accept and expend matching federal funds
 
02:10:36.310 --> 02:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
without fiscal committee approval and
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
that would cover it all right so so that
 
02:10:42.510 --> 02:10:42.520 align:start position:0%
feels like it just made the amendment
 
02:10:44.830 --> 02:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
better all right let's do another show
 
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
of hands because it's
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
different all yeah any okay that was is
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
a a N9 nothing show of hands so we'll
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
look at that Friday or Monday afternoon
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%

02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair question before lunch is this I
 
02:12:33.549 --> 02:12:33.559 align:start position:0%
mean this is pretty significant
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
difference at what point does this um
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
probably not in the intent of the bill
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
but maybe the language at what point uh
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
do we need to address this with the
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
senate or how does well we okay I think
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
I understand your question if this
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't answer what you think your
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
question is let me know I I I think
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing a normal house function
 
02:12:59.950 --> 02:12:59.960 align:start position:0%
we're taking a look at a bill we're
 
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
amending the bill we're teeing it up to
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
get it on the house floor the house will
 
02:13:08.709 --> 02:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
vote on it and based on how the house
 
02:13:12.350 --> 02:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
votes if the bills are significantly
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
aligned um and both passing they go to a
 
02:13:17.790 --> 02:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and the
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee of conference negotiates uh
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
Within in the bright lines of the
 
02:13:27.549 --> 02:13:27.559 align:start position:0%
bill you know what the house did and
 
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
what the Senate did and if there can't
 
02:13:33.629 --> 02:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
be agreement within that that framework
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
then uh you basically the bill doesn't
 
02:13:38.910 --> 02:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
pass so business as
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
usual I think all right I'd still like
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
to finish our conversation on
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
hungry all right all right I the the
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
reason I I want to knock out 417 is it
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
feels to me we've got another potential
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee discussion around this and
 
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
and when we break for lunch we're also
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
kind of breaking for
 
02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittees I I I I will defer to you
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
though would you like to break for lunch
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
now and
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
and I I'm I'm going to be sensitive and
 
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
say we're going to break for lunch now
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess Mr chair it sounds
 
02:14:22.030 --> 02:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
like you like who the what you want to
 
02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
have in the subcommittee why you just
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
have name the subcommittee I oh right
 
02:14:28.910 --> 02:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
now sure if you sound like you're going
 
02:14:33.390 --> 02:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
in a direction okay uh well all right so
 
02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:35.390 align:start position:0%
in a direction okay uh well all right so
on

02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
417 help me summarize where we we're at
 
02:14:40.990 --> 02:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney I think we have on
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
4117 we have a wer Amendment we have a
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
whole Amendment and then I've designated
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative Leon to channel
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
representative hle so uh uh and and
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
then um and then we would like to have
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
one of our blue team members on that so
 
02:15:05.549 --> 02:15:05.559 align:start position:0%
who would like to talk about go
 
02:15:09.549 --> 02:15:09.559 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm sorry if my comment 30 seconds
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
ago um jumped gun but I this is looks
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
like an eight page rewrite the whole
 
02:15:21.629 --> 02:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that we haven't looked at
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
haven't had a walk through um I do
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
understand represent Wilder's Amendment
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
um but I feel like we haven't had any
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
more in-depth discussion to break out
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
into a subcommittee of two people or
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
three people I think is a that that's
 
02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
why I was going to continue with 417 I
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
know maybe I just need a minute break to
 
02:15:45.310 --> 02:15:45.320 align:start position:0%
go grab my water and use the ladies room
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%

subcommittee that
 
02:17:23.790 --> 02:17:23.800 align:start position:0%
I know I know that's why we're not going
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
to but then can't also be doing the sube
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
sub I I'm not sure how I can read this
 
02:17:31.950 --> 02:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
be on the subcommittee for 352 and on
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for 404 no we're going
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
to fix that so who is going to be on the
 
02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:40.910 align:start position:0%
to fix that so who is going to be on the
subcommittee

02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
um we've got 352 I'd like to be on 352
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
please and I also have an amendment
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
where I would be pulling back from what
 
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
I have but adding in into the language
 
02:17:54.349 --> 02:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
of what the reporting would be to have
 
02:17:56.589 --> 02:17:56.599 align:start position:0%
information on what follow-up tests are
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
required what the cost is and who's
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
paying for that and how much of that
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
sharees of firefighters which of those
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
two are you more passionate about 352 or
 
02:18:11.589 --> 02:18:11.599 align:start position:0%
44 352 okay so you're on that sub
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee yes I I have I have an
 
02:18:16.389 --> 02:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that's in drafting so I'm not
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
sure how much it makes sense to do that
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
when I don't have the link to 352 you
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
have an amendment on 352 yes because I'm
 
02:18:25.309 --> 02:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
changing my Amendment from what it was
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
to something like so the subcommittee is
 
02:18:29.469 --> 02:18:29.479 align:start position:0%
supposed to figure out how you guys can
 
02:18:32.309 --> 02:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
agree to agree and if that Amendment
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
still makes sense after you Agree to
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
Agree then
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
great do that's the purp okay I'm I'm
 
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
assuming way too much all
 
02:18:45.549 --> 02:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
right we are doing this a little
 
02:18:48.509 --> 02:18:48.519 align:start position:0%
different because we have to complete
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
our work by Friday afternoon we have to
 
02:18:54.830 --> 02:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
send something right so so we're
 
02:18:57.790 --> 02:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
stumbling to get to the finish line and
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
we just we if we had more time I would
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
schedule another work session you know
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
but we're trying to figure out how to
 
02:19:07.389 --> 02:19:07.399 align:start position:0%
get this all done kind of today which is
 
02:19:07.399 --> 02:19:08.990 align:start position:0%
get this all done kind of today which is
unusual

02:19:08.990 --> 02:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
so so the purpose of the subcommittee to
 
02:19:14.349 --> 02:19:14.359 align:start position:0%
me is to get three people together to
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
figure out what we can agree to agree on
 
02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
and then take a determined Vote or
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
recommend Commendation on that so so
 
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
we're not finished with those bills
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
we're just getting you all ready to come
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
back and say what you would have us do
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
to complete those bills representative
 
02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
priest yes a point of inquiry uh is
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to meet in the
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
morning of May the 13th prior to the
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
executive session is that Monday yes I I
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
I have pointed out that I I just cannot
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
be here and I I I I could delegate it
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
again to representative Mooney but I'd
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
prefer not to I one or two
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
others yeah so so so we thought about
 
02:20:08.830 --> 02:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
that before you came into the
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.510 --> 02:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
right so I still need somebody to be on
 
02:20:22.790 --> 02:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
404 to instead of representative Lon I
 
02:20:24.590 --> 02:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
guess I can do a driveby with my input
 
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
on that one but I don't know how okay
 
02:20:28.429 --> 02:20:28.439 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll be on that sub subcommittee
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
for 404 all right okay so we're going to
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
break we're going to come back at
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
1:15 and uh hopefully by then the two
 
02:20:40.349 --> 02:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittees will be able to talk about
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
what we've agreed to agree on
 
02:20:49.630 --> 02:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:49.640 --> 02:21:19.550 align:start position:0%
 
115

02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:19.560 align:start position:0%

03:27:33.389 --> 03:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
walner and representative tersi to
 
03:27:37.189 --> 03:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
re-enter the room because um the
 
03:27:39.790 --> 03:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
agreements that we made were on the Fly
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
very verbal um and we um need to make
 
03:27:45.910 --> 03:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
sure that we're hearing the same thing
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
so so so I'm going to hold off until U
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:01.710 --> 03:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
us no it's okay we're just we're we're
 
03:28:05.389 --> 03:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
yeah and poof there you
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
are okay representative Earth um is not
 
03:28:12.710 --> 03:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
here but we can I think we can
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
begin so SB 35 well did did I do that I
 
03:28:19.309 --> 03:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
got to use the hammer we're back out of
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
recess um I want to pick up with uh the
 
03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that uh talked about SB
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
352 the point was to take a lot of
 
03:28:31.710 --> 03:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and try to mold
 
03:28:34.710 --> 03:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
them together and still have something
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
good um and maybe better so uh who who
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
Who's going to speak about the
 
03:28:45.790 --> 03:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreement on what we'd like
 
03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:49.349 align:start position:0%
subcommittee agreement on what we'd like
to

03:28:49.349 --> 03:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
do thank you Mr chair so for the
 
03:28:55.110 --> 03:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
purposes of the discussion I am going to
 
03:28:58.510 --> 03:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
move a motion for the adoption of
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
amendment number
 
03:29:03.349 --> 03:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
1869 to Senate Bell
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
552 excuse me
 
03:29:08.950 --> 03:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
352 and I will speak to that
 
03:29:13.030 --> 03:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment go ahead a second oh second
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
second thank you okay as was originally
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
introduced the
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
morning this
 
03:29:21.910 --> 03:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment would enhance the language of
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
352 and clarifying that it's any
 
03:29:28.710 --> 03:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
combination of one or more of the
 
03:29:30.670 --> 03:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
following tests a blood test and
 
03:29:33.429 --> 03:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
ultrasound of vital organs Etc as
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh reading in the original
 
03:29:38.750 --> 03:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
version as though all the tests are
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
required so that is the consensus of the
 
03:29:45.070 --> 03:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and also representative
 
03:29:47.550 --> 03:29:47.560 align:start position:0%
tersi who had a previous amendment that
 
03:29:49.349 --> 03:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
I don't believe is going to be
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
introducing because of this amendment so
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
I would ask the members to vote
 
03:29:58.429 --> 03:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
Yes does does that summarize the
 
03:30:00.870 --> 03:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
totality of the subcommittee agreements
 
03:30:02.990 --> 03:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
or because I I'd kind of like to see
 
03:30:04.910 --> 03:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
where we're going okay no it doesn't
 
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
because representative Lon has a
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses a separate
 
03:30:11.309 --> 03:30:11.319 align:start position:0%
section of the bill the reporting
 
03:30:13.590 --> 03:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
section and I'm sure she'd want to speak
 
03:30:16.469 --> 03:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
to that representa Leon you love to
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
speak to this yes I speak too much um
 
03:30:21.790 --> 03:30:21.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for this opportunity
 
03:30:24.309 --> 03:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
um I I raise these concerns because
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I have these concerns but
 
03:30:28.150 --> 03:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
they don't seem to be shared and I'm not
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to stand in the way of having an
 
03:30:32.510 --> 03:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the test that is
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
required or that is desired so I am
 
03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawing my previous Amendment but I
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
do want to make sure that we know what
 
03:30:42.309 --> 03:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up testing comes from these who
 
03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
pays for them and how much the
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters need to pay so I have
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's in drafting oh it's
 
03:30:50.710 --> 03:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
printing right now so that's even better
 
03:30:52.830 --> 03:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if you I'll tell you
 
03:30:55.469 --> 03:30:55.479 align:start position:0%
what it is and then we can read it um it
 
03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
adds in section seven it already has the
 
03:30:59.830 --> 03:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
findings to include the number of
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
firefighters screened test conducted
 
03:31:05.510 --> 03:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
results of tests then the amendment adds
 
03:31:07.550 --> 03:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up testing to confirm the results
 
03:31:10.150 --> 03:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
of the screening cost of follow-up tests
 
03:31:11.710 --> 03:31:11.720 align:start position:0%
and method of payment including the
 
03:31:14.189 --> 03:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
firefighter share of costs and then back
 
03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
to the existing language Trends and any
 
03:31:19.189 --> 03:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the pilot program um
 
03:31:21.269 --> 03:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
I think my concerns about how it's paid
 
03:31:24.910 --> 03:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
for are founded and I may be wrong this
 
03:31:26.670 --> 03:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
will give us the information about
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to be concerned
 
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
about the out of outof pocket costs or
 
03:31:33.750 --> 03:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
if my concerns were not based in reality
 
03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
I think that we should have this in the
 
03:31:37.710 --> 03:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
the report and I think that it'll be
 
03:31:40.030 --> 03:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
helpful as we proceed forward so those
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
um since it's not it's bolded in mine
 
03:31:43.830 --> 03:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
but not yours that starts halfway
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
through line six and goes through most
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.950 --> 03:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
seven all right so so my objective on
 
03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
this is uh in order to keep this simple
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
for our colleagues in the house and on
 
03:32:00.910 --> 03:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
the finance committee rather than having
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
two amendments on this bill I'd like to
 
03:32:08.790 --> 03:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh merge them does anyone see any issue
 
03:32:11.349 --> 03:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
with creating another amendment that
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
just collapses these two onto one
 
03:32:13.800 --> 03:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
just collapses these two onto one
document

03:32:20.070 --> 03:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:21.750 --> 03:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
sorry can I just get quick clarification
 
03:32:24.510 --> 03:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
on the number wait wait yeah go ahead
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
what's your question did I just get a
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
quick clarification on the number of the
 
03:32:29.189 --> 03:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
first amendment that was offered
 
03:32:34.349 --> 03:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:46.469 --> 03:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
I have an 1869 I just want to make sure
 
03:32:49.990 --> 03:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's the one that's being discussed it
 
03:32:58.030 --> 03:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.040 --> 03:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
be

03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:13.870 --> 03:33:13.880 align:start position:0%
yes that's our base on yes your that
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:18.319 --> 03:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:33:19.990 --> 03:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
so so I'm not hearing any concern about
 
03:33:25.950 --> 03:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
a conflict if we
 
03:33:29.990 --> 03:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
merged uh the the Mooney Amendment 1869
 
03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the new Layon Amendment 1894
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's no concern about merging them
 
03:33:40.030 --> 03:33:40.040 align:start position:0%
the reason I advocate merger is because
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh the people have to follow our work
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
and the finance committee later has to
 
03:33:47.469 --> 03:33:47.479 align:start position:0%
approve an amendment the house has to
 
03:33:49.910 --> 03:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
approve an amendment so I'd like to just
 
03:33:51.469 --> 03:33:51.479 align:start position:0%
get this down into one
 
03:33:54.269 --> 03:33:54.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Mooney would
 
03:33:57.429 --> 03:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to reconsider your
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
motion yes I'll reconsider my motion uh
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
at the suggestion of the chair I also
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
want to add too that my Amendment takes
 
03:34:07.710 --> 03:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
out the skin cancer provision and
 
03:34:11.790 --> 03:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
removes the cap thank you I withdraw my
 
03:34:15.870 --> 03:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
motion okay so we we could use another
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
motion that would um allow us to merge
 
03:34:26.550 --> 03:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh 1894 and 1869 into a new document do
 
03:34:29.710 --> 03:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
you see any problem with that Mr
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
Ripple I don't uh no and I think you I
 
03:34:34.309 --> 03:34:34.319 align:start position:0%
think you could vote on that motion now
 
03:34:35.710 --> 03:34:35.720 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting for the combined
 
03:34:39.910 --> 03:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment right right representative
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
priest I second the motion is made by
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney to combine to
 
03:34:47.469 --> 03:34:47.479 align:start position:0%
merge these two amendments together in
 
03:34:50.590 --> 03:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
one piece um because I think your
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
arguments are correct it would make it
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
much clearer and simple thank you all
 
03:34:59.429 --> 03:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
right so representative tki I can I can
 
03:35:02.750 --> 03:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
see it say it I just feel like here they
 
03:35:04.830 --> 03:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
are let's do it let's be done move them
 
03:35:07.670 --> 03:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
along okay we're really close to that
 
03:35:09.630 --> 03:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
though really
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
close Okay so so we have a a motion and
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
a second to merge
 
03:35:22.349 --> 03:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
1894 and 1869 into one amendment to 352
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
and that that'll be drafted and if it uh
 
03:35:28.389 --> 03:35:28.399 align:start position:0%
is okay we're going to have a chance to
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
look at it next week to make sure that
 
03:35:34.950 --> 03:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're okay um that then then we're fine
 
03:35:37.790 --> 03:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
so um because we're talking about
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
amendments can we do a show of
 
03:35:43.469 --> 03:35:43.479 align:start position:0%
hands show a hands in favor of merging
 
03:35:46.469 --> 03:35:46.479 align:start position:0%

subcommittee that worked on this because
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%

03:37:00.070 --> 03:37:00.080 align:start position:0%

03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
much so Mr clerk when you're ready to
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
take a Mr chairman could I say something
 
03:37:15.229 --> 03:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
before we're done to representative Leon
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
um thank thank you um and I want to also
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
thank everybody for coming for a good
 
03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
agree good agreement my intention
 
03:37:23.189 --> 03:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
throughout all of this was to make sure
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we had the most useful most
 
03:37:28.150 --> 03:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
beneficial test that would have minimal
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
harms to our firefighters because they
 
03:37:32.510 --> 03:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
do so much for us um I'm thankful that
 
03:37:34.269 --> 03:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to better understand what
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
cost they have to bear as part of this
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
testing because quite frankly they and
 
03:37:39.950 --> 03:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
their families bear a cost that none of
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
us can imagine between everything they
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
do to protect us and everything that
 
03:37:45.510 --> 03:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
they have to do as they raise their
 
03:37:47.189 --> 03:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
families and take care of them with all
 
03:37:49.229 --> 03:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
of the challenges they face not just
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
cancer and everything else so I just
 
03:37:53.110 --> 03:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
want you all to know that all of my
 
03:37:54.750 --> 03:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
concerns were to make sure that we had
 
03:37:57.150 --> 03:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
the best possible test to have the best
 
03:37:59.229 --> 03:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
possible health and lifespan for all of
 
03:38:03.030 --> 03:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:05.630 --> 03:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
families comment would you like to talk
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
about how great firefighters are too I I
 
03:38:11.710 --> 03:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
do but I also want to say uh you know
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
second what was just said but also say
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
that uh uh there really hasn't been the
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
kind of effort to do uh a full cancer
 
03:38:23.189 --> 03:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
screening for any atrisk
 
03:38:25.950 --> 03:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
population uh I think the results of of
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
what happens here um you know uh May
 
03:38:32.670 --> 03:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
draw a lot of national attention not
 
03:38:35.429 --> 03:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
just for firefighters but for all of
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
America and that face different kind of
 
03:38:42.070 --> 03:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
risks so um I'm happily happily going to
 
03:38:42.080 --> 03:38:43.510 align:start position:0%
risks so um I'm happily happily going to
support

03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
this and and I'm looking looking forward
 
03:38:47.950 --> 03:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
to my next family reunion my
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law is a firefighter so go
 
03:38:53.990 --> 03:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Earth I going backwards I
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
think it would be better if somebody
 
03:38:56.189 --> 03:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
else made this motion because I really
 
03:38:57.189 --> 03:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to speak to it very
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
competently in front of the finance
 
03:39:00.309 --> 03:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
committee and there's obviously much
 
03:39:02.309 --> 03:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
bigger experts here like repres sentive
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
tki are you I I think it's okay we have

03:41:04.910 --> 03:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.309 --> 03:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
404 I'd be glad to thank
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
you so we um the subcommittee came
 
03:41:16.750 --> 03:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
together and we talked about some
 
03:41:19.229 --> 03:41:19.239 align:start position:0%
changes that we would make to my
 
03:41:23.030 --> 03:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
original Amendment and the first one was
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
um on line four of the original
 
03:41:29.309 --> 03:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that I brought in this morning
 
03:41:32.790 --> 03:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
was we would use median income 100% of
 
03:41:36.630 --> 03:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
median income instead of the 500% of the
 
03:41:39.710 --> 03:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
federal poverty and median income is um
 
03:41:42.189 --> 03:41:42.199 align:start position:0%
lower than the uh
 
03:41:46.149 --> 03:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
500% um we had a lot of fun talking
 
03:41:47.990 --> 03:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
about whether this was a pilot program
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
or not and we decided this is a project
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
so um throughout the bill you'll see a
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
new a new word that it it becomes a
 
03:41:58.990 --> 03:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
child care Workforce
 
03:42:04.070 --> 03:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
project um and then um at the end of the
 
03:42:08.070 --> 03:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
bill as you remember there was a section
 
03:42:11.790 --> 03:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
that talks about the funding being
 
03:42:15.269 --> 03:42:15.279 align:start position:0%
non-aps and we did um change it to LA
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
the the funds will lapse at the end of
 
03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
the the funds will lapse at the end of
the

03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
bium and representative money also was
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment which she can
 
03:42:28.950 --> 03:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
probably explain better than I can about
 
03:42:32.830 --> 03:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
reporting about the um Department
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
developing a report and we incorporated
 
03:42:40.189 --> 03:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
her Amendment about the report and some
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
specific items she has um the report um
 
03:42:48.030 --> 03:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
gathering information on and we'll
 
03:42:52.910 --> 03:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate that into the 404
 
03:42:56.349 --> 03:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment any any I'm open to questions
 
03:42:57.830 --> 03:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
let's have representative Mooney and
 
03:43:00.670 --> 03:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
then we'll do questions can I do one
 
03:43:03.790 --> 03:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
thing we did engage uh representative uh
 
03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
Ross Barry in this discussion because it
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
did come from the special child care
 
03:43:12.349 --> 03:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
commun um committee so we did engage him
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
in the conversation about the changes
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we were making
 
03:43:18.269 --> 03:43:18.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you Mr chair I'll start
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
with the reporting piece of it uh it was
 
03:43:26.269 --> 03:43:26.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that the reporting
 
03:43:30.149 --> 03:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
piece in my Amendment and in the bill
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
proposed here in the house was not
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
really fully fleshed out and complete so
 
03:43:38.630 --> 03:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
we added a few questions and topics to
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
the reporting piece that could be
 
03:43:44.550 --> 03:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
included so they would be how many
 
03:43:48.189 --> 03:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
qualif for the project how many may be
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
added to the project what it upgrades
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
would be needed and the suggested
 
03:43:57.349 --> 03:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
funding and of course a catchall uh of
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
what else could be included in this
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
report based on this project also the
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
date of the report would be due as I
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:16.950 --> 03:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
2025 I was going to put this report in
 
03:44:19.510 --> 03:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
as a separate catchall Amendment like I
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
did earlier today uh to replace the
 
03:44:23.229 --> 03:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
entire bill but I'm not going to
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
introduce that Amendment I'm going to uh
 
03:44:28.670 --> 03:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
instead back the walner amendment and
 
03:44:31.510 --> 03:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
would like to briefly touch upon one
 
03:44:34.389 --> 03:44:34.399 align:start position:0%
piece of the walner amendment that uh we
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
discussed there at the tail
 
03:44:39.229 --> 03:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
end in addition to everything
 
03:44:42.189 --> 03:44:42.199 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:54.149 --> 03:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
to the waiver request so that's on page
 
03:44:57.870 --> 03:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
two of the house version line 32
 
03:45:01.750 --> 03:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
starting there in that paragraph we will
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
add that federal funds are to be used
 
03:45:06.189 --> 03:45:06.199 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:45:08.990 --> 03:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
project if they can't be found or
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
obtained then it would revert to State
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
funds so that too will be a piece in the
 
03:45:19.710 --> 03:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
walner amendment that I intend to vote
 
03:45:23.389 --> 03:45:23.399 align:start position:0%
for on Senate Bill 404 thank you Mr
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
chair to to make sure I'm clear what
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
what what's we're doing is we're taking
 
03:45:31.469 --> 03:45:31.479 align:start position:0%
what representative walner and you have
 
03:45:35.309 --> 03:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
said and we're giving it to Mr Ripple to
 
03:45:38.389 --> 03:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
create a new Amendment a fresh Amendment
 
03:45:40.830 --> 03:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
that's got everything in it
 
03:45:44.990 --> 03:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
right one Amendment right so because Mr
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
Ripple is critical I mean we've just
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
been talking what's important is Mr
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
Ripple understands this enough to be
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
confident that we can create an
 
03:45:55.830 --> 03:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
amendment that takes care of these
 
03:45:58.149 --> 03:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
complexities do you want to maybe
 
03:46:00.750 --> 03:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
summarize what you think or just tell us
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh bottom line comfortable before he
 
03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
does there there one other piece the I
 
03:46:07.469 --> 03:46:07.479 align:start position:0%
think section three should be removed
 
03:46:07.479 --> 03:46:10.189 align:start position:0%
think section three should be removed
then

03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:12.510 --> 03:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
correct or some clarity should be put in
 
03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
there as
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
well on the top of Page
 
03:46:19.229 --> 03:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
Three where the more the appropriation
 
03:46:19.239 --> 03:46:23.269 align:start position:0%
Three where the more the appropriation
is

03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:26.269 --> 03:46:26.279 align:start position:0%
happening so I think the I think the
 
03:46:27.750 --> 03:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
idea behind representative walner
 
03:46:29.149 --> 03:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
amendment was that it would keep the
 
03:46:31.149 --> 03:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
amounts in her earlier Amendment from
 
03:46:34.110 --> 03:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
today of $1 million for the program and
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:41.309 --> 03:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
implementation yes rep representative
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
Leon um thank you Mr chairman um I just
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure sure that I'm clear on
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
this are we saying that that if federal
 
03:46:49.990 --> 03:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
funds aren't granted we're not going to
 
03:46:51.550 --> 03:46:51.560 align:start position:0%
fund it or if federal funds aren't
 
03:46:52.710 --> 03:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
granted we're not going to pay for it
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
from the state let me tell you what I
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
think I heard okay uh that way I can
 
03:46:58.590 --> 03:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
check to see if I heard right we're
 
03:47:01.389 --> 03:47:01.399 align:start position:0%
going to ask first to spend Federal mon
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
money if we cannot get the federal money
 
03:47:06.550 --> 03:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
then we're willing to do this project
 
03:47:09.469 --> 03:47:09.479 align:start position:0%
using State money General
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
funds is that right correct I didn't
 
03:47:18.149 --> 03:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay I I thought we were going to say
 
03:47:21.309 --> 03:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
that it was Federal only because it
 
03:47:23.149 --> 03:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
would be pretty hard to imagine that
 
03:47:25.149 --> 03:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
unless uh we require it to be federal
 
03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
funds that they might might decide not
 
03:47:28.630 --> 03:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
to fund it if we'll backfill it at the
 
03:47:29.990 --> 03:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
state level but that was my
 
03:47:31.750 --> 03:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding I apologize no you're
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
fine uh that and that's a valid issue so
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
issue that we talked about with chairman
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
Barry uh and chairman Barry's
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
perspective if I heard it right is that
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
he's absolutely convinced the federal
 
03:47:47.469 --> 03:47:47.479 align:start position:0%
money money will be coming and represent
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
walner he is convinced that it'll be
 
03:47:50.080 --> 03:47:51.710 align:start position:0%
walner he is convinced that it'll be
coming

03:47:51.710 --> 03:47:51.720 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:53.229 align:start position:0%
coming
um

03:47:53.229 --> 03:47:53.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:55.830 --> 03:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm not good at counting my chickens
 
03:47:58.590 --> 03:47:58.600 align:start position:0%
before they hatch and and my
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
understanding was that chairman Barry
 
03:48:03.110 --> 03:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
believed that so long as we were not
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
willing to spend State funds there was
 
03:48:06.269 --> 03:48:06.279 align:start position:0%
no way the F federal government would
 
03:48:08.429 --> 03:48:08.439 align:start position:0%
turn us down but if we were willing to
 
03:48:11.229 --> 03:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
spend State funds they may I I think I
 
03:48:15.070 --> 03:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:16.510 --> 03:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
I mean you got to put some skin in the
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
game to get them to say okay and I I I
 
03:48:22.790 --> 03:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
think the position is we we'll show that
 
03:48:25.710 --> 03:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
we willing to put skin in the game and
 
03:48:27.189 --> 03:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
the expectation is they're probably
 
03:48:29.309 --> 03:48:29.319 align:start position:0%
going to deliver on the federal money
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative wner thank you I think
 
03:48:34.269 --> 03:48:34.279 align:start position:0%
you said it correctly thank you
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right so representative Mooney
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you just want to go back to
 
03:48:40.910 --> 03:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative F's comment about
 
03:48:43.070 --> 03:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that is changed in the
 
03:48:45.750 --> 03:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
walner amendment as it was previously
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
this morning thank
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
you representative priest uh thank you
 
03:48:54.510 --> 03:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I have a question to
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney she mentioned four
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
qualifying questions in the reporting I
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
have three could could she repeat those
 
03:49:08.189 --> 03:49:08.199 align:start position:0%
again yes absolutely thank you
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative for the question so in
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
that reporting Clause would
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
appear how many qualify for the project
 
03:49:22.389 --> 03:49:22.399 align:start position:0%
mhm how many may be added to the
 
03:49:27.550 --> 03:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
project what it upgrades may be
 
03:49:31.110 --> 03:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
required and suggested funding going
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
forward and then of course the catchall
 
03:49:36.790 --> 03:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
of any other topic and concern to be
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
03:49:41.070 --> 03:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
report thank you as well as a date
 
03:49:46.710 --> 03:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay so at a high level if you were just
 
03:49:51.830 --> 03:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
to say you were certain that you got all
 
03:49:54.910 --> 03:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
of this or if you want to like drive
 
03:49:57.750 --> 03:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
into detail so that we know exactly what
 
03:50:00.309 --> 03:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to vote on um I'll go into
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
detail especially on the bit about
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
prioritizing federal funds because I've
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
already sent this to OS but just to make
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
sure that what I've sent them is
 
03:50:11.910 --> 03:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
accurate I'll I'll repeat it here
 
03:50:16.189 --> 03:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
so the the new Amendment would be based
 
03:50:18.269 --> 03:50:18.279 align:start position:0%
off of Representative wahner's earlier
 
03:50:19.750 --> 03:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment however it would remove the
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
non-aps provision that's in the bill now
 
03:50:23.790 --> 03:50:23.800 align:start position:0%
and is in that Amendment so the funds
 
03:50:27.309 --> 03:50:27.319 align:start position:0%
would lapse it would be called a project
 
03:50:28.750 --> 03:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
um and it would have a six-month
 
03:50:32.229 --> 03:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
duration from January 1st to June 30th
 
03:50:35.189 --> 03:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
2025 and as an aside I think it'll
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
probably be taken out of Statute as it's
 
03:50:38.830 --> 03:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the bill now and placed into chapter
 
03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
law only by OSS since it's a temporary
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
program now
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
essentially the
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
threshold for eligibility rather than
 
03:50:51.189 --> 03:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
500% of the federal poverty level will
 
03:50:56.630 --> 03:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
income the reporting requirement will
 
03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
include the items that representative
 
03:51:04.910 --> 03:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
Mooney just mentioned uh so an uh an
 
03:51:06.670 --> 03:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
estimate of how many people qualify for
 
03:51:09.149 --> 03:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
the existing Child Care scholarship how
 
03:51:10.870 --> 03:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
many will be added as a result of the
 
03:51:14.189 --> 03:51:14.199 align:start position:0%
project any needed technology or other
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
upgrad grades a suggested funding level
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
going forward and any other relevant
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
information and that report will be due
 
03:51:21.990 --> 03:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
November 1st
 
03:51:26.429 --> 03:51:26.439 align:start position:0%
2025 as far as prioritizing federal
 
03:51:29.229 --> 03:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
funds my understanding was that that
 
03:51:31.870 --> 03:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
should go into section two of the bill
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
which deals with the waiver request but
 
03:51:36.110 --> 03:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
I would like some input from the
 
03:51:38.830 --> 03:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
committee on whether they think it
 
03:51:42.189 --> 03:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
would best fit in section
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to answer the question
 
03:51:56.399 --> 03:51:58.790 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to answer the question
representative

03:51:58.790 --> 03:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:52:01.630 --> 03:52:01.640 align:start position:0%
Mooney I myself don't see a problem with
 
03:52:04.790 --> 03:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
that in terms of placement based on the
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
amendment we just verbally went over
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
regarding that
 
03:52:10.790 --> 03:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
section I don't know if others uh
 
03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
disagree but I myself don't see a
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
so is it the committee's intent that I
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
would replace the appropriation language
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:28.830 --> 03:52:28.840 align:start position:0%
like Federal fund shall be used first
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
where where available with General funds
 
03:52:34.189 --> 03:52:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
remainder representative
 
03:52:39.189 --> 03:52:39.199 align:start position:0%
walner yes but then I think you would
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
need to have wouldn't we need to have at
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
that point an appropriation that would
 
03:52:47.630 --> 03:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
be available if they are will still need
 
03:52:50.790 --> 03:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount right so I so there
 
03:52:52.910 --> 03:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
have been other bills um that make an
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
appropriation of federal funds first uh
 
03:52:56.910 --> 03:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
with General funds used for the
 
03:52:58.830 --> 03:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
remainder so I guess my question is is
 
03:53:00.149 --> 03:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
that how you want to treat the two
 
03:53:03.510 --> 03:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
appropriations of $1 million and
 
03:53:05.830 --> 03:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
100,000 so if there are no federal funds
 
03:53:09.790 --> 03:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
it would be General funds right okay up
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
to if there are no federal funds it
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
would be allowed up to to a million
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
dollar okay of of state general funds
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay I mean you know it's possible that
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
the feds could come back and have a
 
03:53:23.520 --> 03:53:25.110 align:start position:0%
the feds could come back and have a
50-50

03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
50-50
 
03:53:27.710 --> 03:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
program we don't know
 
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
yet okay so I'll have it drafted that
 
03:53:34.510 --> 03:53:34.520 align:start position:0%
way are are you complete on your summary
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
yes all right are there questions about
 
03:53:39.830 --> 03:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
what Mr Ripple just laid out are you
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
prepared to vote on that amendment to be
 
03:53:45.710 --> 03:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
drafted and if if it is in line with
 
03:53:48.229 --> 03:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
what we just described then we're good
 
03:53:49.790 --> 03:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
and we're recommending it to the full
 
03:53:52.349 --> 03:53:52.359 align:start position:0%
finance committee if we if any one of
 
03:53:55.030 --> 03:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
you looks at it and goes this is not
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
what we agreed to then I don't know what
 
03:53:59.550 --> 03:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to do we we we won't go
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
forward it'll create chaos but that can
 
03:54:06.750 --> 03:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
happen so um all right any questions if
 
03:54:10.830 --> 03:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
not um show of hands how many uh are in
 
03:54:13.349 --> 03:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
favor of the amendment as
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
described all right uh any opposed not
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
seeing any opposed n
 
03:54:23.710 --> 03:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
nothing and and then uh we need a a
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%

representative walner has just
 
03:56:18.800 --> 03:56:20.790 align:start position:0%

03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:34.110 --> 03:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
tersi okay so again uh I just need to be
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
reminded what we've already done on 409
 
03:56:40.189 --> 03:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
the ambulance
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
you adopted it with uh an amendment that
 
03:56:51.870 --> 03:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
I've yet to have drafted to change
 
03:56:54.750 --> 03:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare to Medicaid the schedule in
 
03:56:56.349 --> 03:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
various instances and make a few other
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
changes as well all right now and who
 
03:57:02.110 --> 03:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
will write that blur I'll do that as
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
well as an
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
right okay so and then on
 
03:57:14.910 --> 03:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
4555 we accepted that 9 nothing was
 
03:57:16.670 --> 03:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
there was there amendment to that or was
 
03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
that as
 
03:57:24.910 --> 03:57:24.920 align:start position:0%
is yeah there's uh there's still a
 
03:57:27.149 --> 03:57:27.159 align:start position:0%
question mark on the amendment on the
 
03:57:29.229 --> 03:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
amendment number when we voted on it
 
03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
right Mr chair that was the bill where
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative tarki pointed out the
 
03:57:36.030 --> 03:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
numerous references to Medicare not
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and so that amendment was uh
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
verbally adopted though we've not seen
 
03:57:44.750 --> 03:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
it yet in writing for 455 I thought that
 
03:57:47.189 --> 03:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
was the ambulance discussion no that was
 
03:57:49.910 --> 03:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
that was the orthopedic okay so so we've
 
03:57:51.269 --> 03:57:51.279 align:start position:0%
got an
 
03:57:53.389 --> 03:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
otpa on
 
03:57:57.189 --> 03:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
455 and who who would want to write that
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
um I can do that one too you'll do that
 
03:57:59.560 --> 03:58:01.349 align:start position:0%
um I can do that one too you'll do that
one

03:58:01.349 --> 03:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
okay string them I will say I sent I did
 
03:58:06.990 --> 03:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
send a follow-up note after comparing
 
03:58:09.429 --> 03:58:09.439 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates to the Medicaid table he
 
03:58:12.670 --> 03:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
sent so they weren't that directly
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
correlative so some are higher and some
 
03:58:17.590 --> 03:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
are lower so I asked him to check his
 
03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:19.309 align:start position:0%
are lower so I asked him to check his
numbers

03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
03:58:23.309 --> 03:58:23.319 align:start position:0%
okay so we still have five to go uh I
 
03:58:25.389 --> 03:58:25.399 align:start position:0%
think two of them are really quick but
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
let's let's go back to 417 we opened uh
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
the door on
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
lunch um we had representative Wier
 
03:58:47.429 --> 03:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
talk about his
 
03:58:50.189 --> 03:58:50.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then I asked
 
03:58:52.710 --> 03:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lon to channel
 
03:58:55.510 --> 03:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative hle and before we get
 
03:58:58.630 --> 03:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
into this I'm going to end up recessing
 
03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279 align:start position:0%
this uh after we talk about it a little
 
03:59:03.429 --> 03:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
bit to Tuesday
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%

Tuesday morning I have um a longstanding
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
appointment and which is why it was
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
scheduled at 1: p.m. so
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we continue as you just stated we
 
03:59:28.550 --> 03:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
would not be able to get me a sub if I
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
was supposed to come back for 1 p.m. you
 
03:59:33.349 --> 03:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
we can't get a sub for you for Tuesday
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
morning no because if I'm coming at 1:00
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
I can't par you got to be off campus all
 
03:59:42.389 --> 03:59:42.399 align:start position:0%
day oh I see well I can't be here either
 
03:59:45.870 --> 03:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
so that'll balance things out
 
03:59:48.870 --> 03:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't have us up I'm we
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
can't be here in the afternoon we'll
 
03:59:54.510 --> 03:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
both be here in the afternoon yes right
 
03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
so so representative walner i' i' i' I'd
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
like to be able to recess us to Tuesday
 
04:00:02.830 --> 04:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
Morning knowing that representative
 
04:00:05.229 --> 04:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
tersi and representative Earth will both
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
session are we going to discuss sorry I
 
04:00:15.469 --> 04:00:15.479 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious are we going to like
 
04:00:18.269 --> 04:00:18.279 align:start position:0%
walk away from this right now or are we
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to have a discussion right now I I
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
think we're going to listen to
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
representative um um Leon who has
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk to the whole Amendment
 
04:00:30.870 --> 04:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and I think the point of it will
 
04:00:33.429 --> 04:00:33.439 align:start position:0%
talk just enough for us to be able to
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
come back Tuesday
 
04:00:38.030 --> 04:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
Morning uh and then really do the vote
 
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday morning I guess I have some
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
concerns about that since you're
 
04:00:45.110 --> 04:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
accommodating representative H who can't
 
04:00:48.389 --> 04:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
be here but yet I can't be there and I
 
04:00:51.110 --> 04:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
might have some comments on
 
04:00:53.950 --> 04:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
um are you not able to share your
 
04:00:55.990 --> 04:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
comments before Tuesday morning no I can
 
04:00:57.189 --> 04:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
but you just said we'd listen to
 
04:00:58.630 --> 04:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative Lon and then move on to
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning and I didn't know if
 
04:01:02.189 --> 04:01:02.199 align:start position:0%
we'd have a discussion representative
 
04:01:04.229 --> 04:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
Hull had made a prior
 
04:01:04.239 --> 04:01:07.590 align:start position:0%
Hull had made a prior
request

04:01:07.590 --> 04:01:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday I just feel like we if we're
 
04:01:13.750 --> 04:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
going to have a discussion on this bill
 
04:01:15.510 --> 04:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and representative H's Amendment
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
then we need to bring into the
 
04:01:19.389 --> 04:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
discussion of chairman wier's Amendment
 
04:01:22.429 --> 04:01:22.439 align:start position:0%
and what some concerns might be we we we
 
04:01:24.149 --> 04:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
did introduce the Wilder Amendment we
 
04:01:26.790 --> 04:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed it not yet I'm trying
 
04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
to get all the Amendments out so that we
 
04:01:31.389 --> 04:01:31.399 align:start position:0%
see the terrain that we're going to walk
 
04:01:32.830 --> 04:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if I misunderstood but it
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
sounded like we were not going to have
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
the in the discussion until Tuesday I
 
04:01:39.189 --> 04:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
apologize no we're going to have a
 
04:01:40.590 --> 04:01:40.600 align:start position:0%
little bit of discussion we're going to
 
04:01:42.269 --> 04:01:42.279 align:start position:0%
introduce the Amendments we're going to
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
walk through them a little bit so that
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
we fertilize our brains about it and and
 
04:01:51.469 --> 04:01:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh wait till uh Tuesday to make a
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation of division three to uh
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.750 --> 04:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
ahead so I think what we're trying to do
 
04:02:06.189 --> 04:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
is we're trying to accommodate uh
 
04:02:08.469 --> 04:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative Hall who is not here but
 
04:02:08.479 --> 04:02:10.030 align:start position:0%
representative Hall who is not here but
who

04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:02:12.429 --> 04:02:12.439 align:start position:0%
has a very
 
04:02:15.429 --> 04:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
expansive Amendment
 
04:02:17.950 --> 04:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
yes we have to go back we have to be
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
here on uh Tuesday afternoon for full
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
full Finance to do the executing we have
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:30.429 --> 04:02:30.439 align:start position:0%
one I I just guess I don't understand
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
how we're going to actually be able to
 
04:02:34.710 --> 04:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
go through this
 
04:02:38.070 --> 04:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
whole amendment that he's brought
 
04:02:42.070 --> 04:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
in you know how involved discussion
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
gets and then have something ready to
 
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
1:00 it feels like what we need need to
 
04:02:55.590 --> 04:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
do is just what we've done on some of
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
these other bills we have developed the
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that we've all agreed to and
 
04:03:03.870 --> 04:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
then we'll take we'll take a look at it
 
04:03:07.630 --> 04:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
when we get here on Tuesday or
 
04:03:10.309 --> 04:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
Monday and say yes this is what we
 
04:03:13.790 --> 04:03:13.800 align:start position:0%
agreed to I just think waiting and then
 
04:03:15.510 --> 04:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
going through this huge amendment that
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
day is going to be very
 
04:03:20.229 --> 04:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
difficult and there's also 10 bills to
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
go through in that
 
04:03:24.590 --> 04:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon yeah
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
so okay so never make a decision that
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be made yet so I'm not
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
going to make a decision we're just
 
04:03:34.110 --> 04:03:34.120 align:start position:0%
going to plow through this and see where
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
it takes
 
04:03:40.189 --> 04:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
US Representative Leon um thank you Mr
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I was just going to let you
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
know that I do have some better
 
04:03:46.110 --> 04:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
highlights of where the changes are so
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
that I'll be able to walk people through
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
and they are some pretty much
 
04:03:53.429 --> 04:03:53.439 align:start position:0%
consistent consistent language changes
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
throughout so that if determining that
 
04:03:58.710 --> 04:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
certain wording is correct as it flows
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
through the bill it's not as big of a
 
04:04:03.189 --> 04:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
change as it does appear but it's
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
important good so it's not going to be
 
04:04:07.990 --> 04:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
hard to understand the amendment then
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to assume that anything's
 
04:04:11.389 --> 04:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
easy to understand but I think it's a
 
04:04:13.149 --> 04:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
lot less daunting than I thought before
 
04:04:16.710 --> 04:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
we broke for lunch okay you're you're up
 
04:04:18.750 --> 04:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
tell us what you want us to
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
know so so what I've asked
 
04:04:25.710 --> 04:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
representative Leon to do is to take the
 
04:04:28.670 --> 04:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
whole Amendment as though she was
 
04:04:31.550 --> 04:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
channeling representative ho so that we
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
can get the best case for it and then we
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
can probably discuss it some so she's
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
not advocating her position she's
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
representing representative whole
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:04:48.510 --> 04:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment moving in
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
section one um if you look on line 8 it
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
adds the language that there's no
 
04:04:58.269 --> 04:04:58.279 align:start position:0%
options for instate placement that exist
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
um by having no options for instate
 
04:05:02.630 --> 04:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
placement that exists then there's that
 
04:05:05.630 --> 04:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
prioritization for instate um and then
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
the other language that's different in
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
there is that lines 13 and 14 it would
 
04:05:11.590 --> 04:05:11.600 align:start position:0%
require both the written approval of the
 
04:05:14.910 --> 04:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
director of dcyf and increased judicial
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
oversight The increased judicial
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
oversight is already there so so in
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the the director of DCF who
 
04:05:24.590 --> 04:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
gets added as a sign off no the director
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
of DCF is the one who is
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
added okay there's already in the ex in
 
04:05:32.189 --> 04:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
the bill as we have it I believe already
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
includes the increased judicial
 
04:05:36.870 --> 04:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
oversight um I I would assume that
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
having the director of dcyf um sign off
 
04:05:42.110 --> 04:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
means that we have specific
 
04:05:43.870 --> 04:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
accountability so that there's an
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
individual who was involved in the
 
04:05:48.630 --> 04:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
decision that 1573 which was basically
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
the house okay all right back up to page
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
still on page one line
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
four it had least restrictive crossed
 
04:06:01.149 --> 04:06:01.159 align:start position:0%
out and less restrictive put in he's
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
gone back to least restrictive I don't
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
see that line four I I I read as read as
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
follows what page are you on so first
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah original Bill
 
04:06:16.319 --> 04:06:19.830 align:start position:0%
yeah original Bill
oh

04:06:19.830 --> 04:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's basically what he's changing
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
is the original Bill 15 15 different
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
places to least restrictive instead of
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
less restrictive yep okay um that one
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
that one I I guess I I I missed that one
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
that I guess that's in the tra changes
 
04:06:38.710 --> 04:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
so that's an important one to figure out
 
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
policy-wise if less restrictive or least
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
restrictive is more important so so how
 
04:06:44.429 --> 04:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
do you see that represent wer what what
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
do you see the tradeoff is between those
 
04:06:46.800 --> 04:06:48.389 align:start position:0%
do you see the tradeoff is between those
two

04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
conditions least restrictive versus
 
04:06:52.750 --> 04:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
language as opposed to the bill CH less
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
broad it's obvious which is the least
 
04:07:02.670 --> 04:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
restrictive there could be 10 of them
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
that were less
 
04:07:07.149 --> 04:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
restrictive so least restrictive is more
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
specific than less restrictive right
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
would you prefer less the least
 
04:07:16.670 --> 04:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
well here's he he's emphasizing least
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
restrictive on on what page on what line
 
04:07:21.790 --> 04:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
item of his amendment is is the least
 
04:07:24.670 --> 04:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
page six on his Amendment line six line
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
six line
 
04:07:29.950 --> 04:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
six and it's on it's line four oh there
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
it is how come that's not shown up as a
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
bold least restrictive because it's
 
04:07:36.229 --> 04:07:36.239 align:start position:0%
going back to the current law as opposed
 
04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
to what's in the bill um and I apologize
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
for missing that no no I'm I'm totally
 
04:07:45.710 --> 04:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
missing it so so that's great thank you
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
Mr all right I I interrupt go ahead
 
04:07:48.840 --> 04:07:50.429 align:start position:0%
Mr all right I I interrupt go ahead

we'll we'll get your input when it's
 
04:08:34.950 --> 04:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate yes I was I just thought
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
since um she had worked with
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
representive H and talked to him that
 
04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
represent Lon who got handed this
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um an hour ago I hear your
 
04:08:46.149 --> 04:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
point thank you yes and um
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead sorry I didn't mean to
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
jump in um so as we go through if we
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
mark it up we know where those changes
 
04:08:54.389 --> 04:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
are the next one if you move down to
 
04:08:57.750 --> 04:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
line 29 um it is using the clear and
 
04:09:00.269 --> 04:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence which is the higher
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
standard and one that is already used in
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
many areas there's the concern that
 
04:09:07.550 --> 04:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
going to preponderance of evidence um
 
04:09:09.590 --> 04:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be lowering the bar and then the
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
courts would need to decide if Our
 
04:09:13.109 --> 04:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
intention legislatively is to lower the
 
04:09:14.670 --> 04:09:14.680 align:start position:0%
bar from the current clear and
 
04:09:18.149 --> 04:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
convincing um language all right um then
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
moving to page two there was something
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
else in that section though that was
 
04:09:23.830 --> 04:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
added I
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
just on line
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
25 line 25 of the
 
04:09:32.910 --> 04:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment oh the deemed a fit
 
04:09:36.389 --> 04:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
parent I I see the same Lang let me see
 
04:09:37.670 --> 04:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
here that's the same language it
 
04:09:40.750 --> 04:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
represent the wer brought out right it's
 
04:09:42.550 --> 04:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
in the wer minut sorry I don't have the
 
04:09:45.109 --> 04:09:45.119 align:start position:0%
wer one direct clean from me apolog yeah
 
04:09:47.070 --> 04:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
no no that's just a that's just a
 
04:09:49.950 --> 04:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
replicant of of Wier sorry yes that's
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
the same as Wier otherwise the changes
 
04:09:54.389 --> 04:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
the similari is and
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
difference so that has the same language
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
as the Wilder amendment in line 25 uh
 
04:10:03.229 --> 04:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
moving to page two line five instead of
 
04:10:05.870 --> 04:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
having the unique needs it adds the
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
words the unique physical mental
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
emotional and medical needs because that
 
04:10:12.389 --> 04:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
is how it was described and by having
 
04:10:15.870 --> 04:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
that it spelled out it is more clear um
 
04:10:17.550 --> 04:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
so instead of deleting that section it
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
clarifies it then moving to um section g
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
which is lines 12 through
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
17 that um has the language um that has
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
the language within this where um
 
04:10:32.309 --> 04:10:32.319 align:start position:0%
Senator bsel had added the parent
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
parents cooperation but instead of being
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
a stick it turns it into a carrot where
 
04:10:37.830 --> 04:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
their effort to provide any records
 
04:10:39.349 --> 04:10:39.359 align:start position:0%
necessary shall be weighed as a factor
 
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
in favor of the fitness of the parent um
 
04:10:43.950 --> 04:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
so that instead of it being Mark against
 
04:10:45.790 --> 04:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
the parent for not cooperating it is a
 
04:10:48.469 --> 04:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
mark in favor of the parent um and then
 
04:10:50.870 --> 04:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
additionally this has the Wilder
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
language about the fact that a parent
 
04:10:54.269 --> 04:10:54.279 align:start position:0%
owns a firearm shall not make an home in
 
04:10:56.590 --> 04:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
safe adding the words nor be waited
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
against the
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
parent then um moving to so so that's
 
04:11:04.990 --> 04:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
more words that's more words nor be
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
waited against the parent correct
 
04:11:13.950 --> 04:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
okay moving to line 27 um it has the
 
04:11:16.710 --> 04:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
contrary to the welfare it says that if
 
04:11:18.550 --> 04:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
the remaining in the care of the child's
 
04:11:20.229 --> 04:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
parent or legal guardian is determined
 
04:11:22.030 --> 04:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
to be contrary to the welfare of the
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
child which is that higher standard that
 
04:11:26.910 --> 04:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
we currently have that is current New
 
04:11:28.870 --> 04:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law so if we passed it with
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
weaker language um that would give conf
 
04:11:33.750 --> 04:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
give uh M the judges would need to know
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
whether legislatively we're trying to
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
weaken the protection for the families
 
04:11:40.990 --> 04:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
um and for the families staying together
 
04:11:42.790 --> 04:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
what line were you on I'm sorry that is
 
04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
on line 27 contrary to the welfare of
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
the child on page two on page
 
04:11:52.030 --> 04:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
two wait a
 
04:11:55.990 --> 04:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
second yeah so we're going to do this so
 
04:12:00.309 --> 04:12:00.319 align:start position:0%
we minimize confusion so 26 and 27 reads
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
if remaining in the care of the parents
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
child's parent or legal guardian is
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
determined to be contrary to the welfare
 
04:12:09.910 --> 04:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the child to secure
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
placement and the bill as it reads reads
 
04:12:14.550 --> 04:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
if presume that remaining in the family
 
04:12:16.030 --> 04:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
home is in the best interest of the
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
child but if it is determined to not be
 
04:12:20.830 --> 04:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the child's best interest that is
 
04:12:23.790 --> 04:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
weaker language um for the protection of
 
04:12:25.990 --> 04:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
keeping the family together um when it's
 
04:12:27.990 --> 04:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate than having the language
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
that if remaining in the care of the
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
child's parent or legal guardian is
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
determined to be contrary to the welfare
 
04:12:35.229 --> 04:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:12:39.630 --> 04:12:39.640 align:start position:0%
child all right then on line 28 it adds
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
the link as defined in RSA 170-25
 
04:12:47.229 --> 04:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
um only kin is defined so this is one of
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
the areas that I had noted but I didn't
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
join with him on drafting this language
 
04:12:54.790 --> 04:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
kin is defined in RSA
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
170-25 fictive kin is not so if we're
 
04:13:00.189 --> 04:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
intending to prioritize blood related
 
04:13:03.269 --> 04:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
kin um that is a subset of the
 
04:13:06.469 --> 04:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
definition in the statutes so if it's
 
04:13:08.469 --> 04:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
with kin or fictive kin if they're
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
decide if they should be viewed the same
 
04:13:13.550 --> 04:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
then that should say with kin as defined
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
in ours so um we would want to change
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
that in his amendment to strike out oric
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
of kin because that definition does not
 
04:13:24.790 --> 04:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
exist if there should be a distinction
 
04:13:27.990 --> 04:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
between blood kin and general kin then
 
04:13:29.550 --> 04:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
we would need to note that and make that
 
04:13:31.189 --> 04:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
in a way that's not inconsistent with
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
our other definition of kin so the
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee had been trying to get
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
the definition of fictive kin into
 
04:13:40.469 --> 04:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
something was it was it 1573 or was it
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
417 it was in 498
 
04:13:46.510 --> 04:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
um 498 is a bill was a bill that used
 
04:13:48.830 --> 04:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
the term fictive kin they were told in
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
policy committee that there was a
 
04:13:52.469 --> 04:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
definition in RSA
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
170-25 but that definition isn't for
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
fictive kin that definition is for kin
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so it seems to me like our
 
04:14:03.710 --> 04:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
statute still wants a definition of
 
04:14:06.670 --> 04:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
fictive kin if you're going to use it if
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
we use the term kin and if we want to if
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
there are times when we want to refer to
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
blood kin uh so those people who are
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
related by blood as opposed to the
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
broader definition that we use in our
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
statutes which is essentially fictive
 
04:14:23.269 --> 04:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
kin I think it's um in order to access
 
04:14:24.830 --> 04:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
tanif that we need to have the
 
04:14:26.790 --> 04:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
definition of kin be broader to include
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
fictive kin I believe that's why it was
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
expanded last year as kin instead of
 
04:14:33.870 --> 04:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
naming it fictive kin and yes I have the
 
04:14:35.429 --> 04:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
same headache about this as you do
 
04:14:37.510 --> 04:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative about the challenges of
 
04:14:40.630 --> 04:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
the de details yeah I guess I get I
 
04:14:42.670 --> 04:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
what's and I'm not an expert on this so
 
04:14:44.910 --> 04:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize what is concerning me is the
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
way you use the term blood kin versus
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
kin because I think we all know that we
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
have family that's not related by blood
 
04:14:55.349 --> 04:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just getting weary in a policy
 
04:14:57.149 --> 04:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
area that we're not versed in that was
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
the headache look do do you see in
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
general the value not getting into the
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
specifics but do you see in general the
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
value of having definitions for two
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
terms Ken and fictive Ken and then if
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
you do then it's just an issue of
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
compatible I guess as I'm looking back
 
04:15:20.189 --> 04:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
at the original Bill
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
though I mean in my head I can use an
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
layman's terms what that means kin INF
 
04:15:28.510 --> 04:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
fictive kin I understand as we've heard
 
04:15:30.870 --> 04:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
it you know in testimony from the
 
04:15:32.389 --> 04:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
Department from talking to people in
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
children family law I guess I'm
 
04:15:37.429 --> 04:15:37.439 align:start position:0%
questioning if we need to dig in here
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
and give it more
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
definition as opposed to what the
 
04:15:43.670 --> 04:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
testimony was from
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
OCA in in you know the the way they use
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:51.389 --> 04:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
department and thank you when you look
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
at this um we've been told that the
 
04:15:57.149 --> 04:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
definition of the word kin includes
 
04:15:59.870 --> 04:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
what's colloquially known as fictive kin
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
so using both the terms kin and then
 
04:16:05.309 --> 04:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
fictive kin given that our statutes
 
04:16:08.349 --> 04:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
Define kin as the colloquial fictive kin
 
04:16:09.910 --> 04:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about fictive kin or
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
fictive fictive kin when we say kin or
 
04:16:12.520 --> 04:16:14.109 align:start position:0%
fictive fictive kin when we say kin or
fictive

04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
fictive
 
04:16:16.950 --> 04:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
kin that is a lot of why I was trying to
 
04:16:19.269 --> 04:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
get to a definition in 498 so that we
 
04:16:21.149 --> 04:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
could have it correct but um I had
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
expected the amendment on 417 to pass
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
with that definition um that the child
 
04:16:28.550 --> 04:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and family law committee had had so
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
there was no addition of the definition
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
of fictif kin to
 
04:16:35.070 --> 04:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
498 to representative Mooney thank you
 
04:16:38.109 --> 04:16:38.119 align:start position:0%
very much so I am on the
 
04:16:40.429 --> 04:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
DHHS website of the State of New
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where there is a whole page
 
04:16:42.479 --> 04:16:43.349 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where there is a whole page
entitled

04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
entitled
 
04:16:49.109 --> 04:16:49.119 align:start position:0%
kinship care in that on that page
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
there's a Definition of kinship and it
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
says Point Blank if you are a family
 
04:16:57.109 --> 04:16:57.119 align:start position:0%
friend have a close relationship or are
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
an important person in the life of the
 
04:17:02.030 --> 04:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
child or teen then you are considered
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
quote fictive King is it possible to
 
04:17:08.149 --> 04:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
include this website language from our
 
04:17:13.149 --> 04:17:13.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
I'm pulling up the definition in
 
04:17:17.990 --> 04:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
170-25 right
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
175-25 there is only kin defined and kin
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
is sorry they're not alphabetical which
 
04:17:35.469 --> 04:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
makes it extra fun it is item eight kin
 
04:17:39.030 --> 04:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
meets a child or children for who there
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
for who for kin means a child or
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
children who for for which there is a
 
04:17:46.030 --> 04:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
connection or history between a child or
 
04:17:48.630 --> 04:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
their parents and another responsible
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
adult including but not limited to
 
04:17:53.990 --> 04:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
related adults so that's our definition
 
04:17:56.830 --> 04:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
of kin which is the colloquial
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
definition of fictive
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
kin um to me the F the related adults
 
04:18:04.990 --> 04:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
idea of kin which is the one that you
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
think of is I that I'm been referring to
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
as blood kin the question is if we need
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
a if if we're going to have kin and
 
04:18:14.109 --> 04:18:14.119 align:start position:0%
fictive kin within our law we need to
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand what that difference is
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
because otherwise this is going to lead
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
to a lot of confusion if we simply say
 
04:18:22.990 --> 04:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
with kin as defined in RSA
 
04:18:25.950 --> 04:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
170-25 that includes that broader one as
 
04:18:28.349 --> 04:18:28.359 align:start position:0%
on the website so it seems like the path
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
of least resistance to me is on line 28
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the whole Amendment striking the the
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
three words or fictive
 
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
Ken right y yes okay I I'd rather do
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
that and that way we're getting out of
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
the Poli issue and getting back to the
 
04:18:49.149 --> 04:18:49.159 align:start position:0%
other issues yes and um and also if I
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
may make a suggestion perhaps adding to
 
04:18:54.950 --> 04:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
this bill um if assuming it's Germain to
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
amend that definition to say kin or
 
04:18:59.550 --> 04:18:59.560 align:start position:0%
fictive kin since we mean that as the
 
04:19:02.070 --> 04:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
same definition because fictive kin is
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
used elsewhere in our statutes now that
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
will be so I'm trying to I'm trying to
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
duck it you know that's a policy debate
 
04:19:10.750 --> 04:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the policy committee can have how
 
04:19:14.189 --> 04:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
to fix our law with Ken and infective k
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
i I don't want to do that understood
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
that it's a it's a peeve of mine but I
 
04:19:20.830 --> 04:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
will pass on that because I'm a GU here
 
04:19:22.630 --> 04:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's valid you're valid if we're
 
04:19:24.910 --> 04:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
going to use the word or fictive kin we
 
04:19:27.229 --> 04:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
need to have two definitions we we'll
 
04:19:29.030 --> 04:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
fix it in this bill and we'll leave it
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
to them to fix the rest all right okay
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
what else
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
next moving to page three lines 15
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
through 21 section
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
B this is filling in the stat statutory
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
guidance um because right now there's
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
silence around what happens when the the
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
needs of the child cannot be met by can
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
fictive kin or in a foster family home
 
04:19:55.469 --> 04:19:55.479 align:start position:0%
um because right now there's no guidance
 
04:19:58.469 --> 04:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
to the courts about what would happen if
 
04:20:01.229 --> 04:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
the ideal selection within the whole
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
category of prioritization is not
 
04:20:06.070 --> 04:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
available um and it would be beneficial
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
to the courts to have that guidance and
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
stating also that neither the shortage
 
04:20:12.229 --> 04:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
or lack of foster family homes nor the
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
lack of community- based resources as
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
expressed by the department um that's an
 
04:20:18.670 --> 04:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
important phrase shall be acceptable
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
reasons for determining that the needs
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
of the child cannot be met in a family
 
04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
setting nonetheless if there's no can
 
04:20:26.950 --> 04:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
fictive can or lied foser home available
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
at the time that the court is ordering
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
placement of the child the court May
 
04:20:32.109 --> 04:20:32.119 align:start position:0%
order the best available temporary
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
placement while the Department of Health
 
04:20:35.590 --> 04:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and Human Services prioritizes locating
 
04:20:38.309 --> 04:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
a preferred placement so so I like this
 
04:20:41.309 --> 04:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
language better than what we had in 1573
 
04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
but online if we were to take whole
 
04:20:49.269 --> 04:20:49.279 align:start position:0%
completely uh uh then fictive K on line
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
15 would have to be struck and on line
 
04:20:55.469 --> 04:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
19 fictive Ken would need to be struck
 
04:20:58.229 --> 04:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay correct all
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
right but okay why wouldn't you do that
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you Mr chair I the the
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
term fictive kin makes it very clear
 
04:21:10.830 --> 04:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
that there's a non-blood
 
04:21:13.710 --> 04:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
relationship I see this uh definition on
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
the dhh website this term has carried in
 
04:21:20.670 --> 04:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
all of these versions of this bill and I
 
04:21:22.990 --> 04:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
I find it to be rather critical that it
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
be either left in and defined or or left
 
04:21:28.349 --> 04:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
in and leave it to uh somebody to search
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
the dhh website for the definition but
 
04:21:35.429 --> 04:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
my recommendation is leave it in uh as
 
04:21:37.670 --> 04:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's uh critically important that there
 
04:21:41.109 --> 04:21:41.119 align:start position:0%
be a distinction between a blood kin and
 
04:21:43.510 --> 04:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
a non-blood
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
relative so my issue with your
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
observation is is that the law currently
 
04:21:54.910 --> 04:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
describes Ken broadly enough to include
 
04:21:58.349 --> 04:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
the definition of fictive Ken so so we
 
04:22:01.229 --> 04:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
referenced the definition of Ken by
 
04:22:03.630 --> 04:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
Statute reference right what line was
 
04:22:06.189 --> 04:22:06.199 align:start position:0%
that where we referenced Ken by Statute
 
04:22:13.510 --> 04:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
that was on page two line 28 line 28
 
04:22:17.109 --> 04:22:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay so so representative Mooney I would
 
04:22:20.870 --> 04:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
I would posit that because we're we
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
would change that to say with a kin as
 
04:22:26.830 --> 04:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
defined by RSA blah then everywhere we
 
04:22:29.469 --> 04:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
use kin in here you would refer back to
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
the de definition and as we heard it's
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
broad enough to capture fictive kin my
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
issue with keeping kin and fictive kin
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
is that it implies that in the statute
 
04:22:46.149 --> 04:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
we have def def differential or
 
04:22:49.389 --> 04:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
differential definitions which we do not
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
so so I would just keep it all kin to be
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with the statutory reference
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
does that make sense yes I'm going to
 
04:22:59.109 --> 04:22:59.119 align:start position:0%
look at that I'm going to look I'm going
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
to look up that RSA right now but
 
04:23:03.550 --> 04:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
understood your point yes okay and and
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
and again I I do think we'll probably
 
04:23:10.229 --> 04:23:10.239 align:start position:0%
recess on this and come back Tuesday is
 
04:23:12.990 --> 04:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
my my instinct on it so we don't have to
 
04:23:15.389 --> 04:23:15.399 align:start position:0%
decide this right
 
04:23:19.109 --> 04:23:19.119 align:start position:0%
now right no this is just we're just
 
04:23:20.870 --> 04:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
going through the weeds here so
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
representatively on what else um now on
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
page three moving down to lines 32 and
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
33 it adds the words unless the
 
04:23:31.109 --> 04:23:31.119 align:start position:0%
department demonstrates evidence to the
 
04:23:33.309 --> 04:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
um to the
 
04:23:35.750 --> 04:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
contrary so this is about the return of
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
custody as in the best interest of the
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
child and with showing that the parent
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
has an ability to provide proper
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
parental care it shall be presumed that
 
04:23:44.670 --> 04:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
return of the C return of custody is in
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
the child's best interest unless the
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
department demonstrates evidence to the
 
04:23:50.710 --> 04:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
contrary so that gives that opportunity
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
where um the department can step in in
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
order to protect that child if they need
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:02.670 --> 04:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
right then moving to page four line
 
04:24:06.229 --> 04:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
three it adds that um in order to order
 
04:24:08.510 --> 04:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
a not aate placement there needs to be
 
04:24:10.750 --> 04:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
the express written finding that no
 
04:24:13.910 --> 04:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
instate options exist and that out of
 
04:24:15.309 --> 04:24:15.319 align:start position:0%
State placement offers specialized
 
04:24:17.109 --> 04:24:17.119 align:start position:0%
programming and services that are unable
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
to be provided within New Hampshire um
 
04:24:21.710 --> 04:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit belt in suspenders
 
04:24:23.910 --> 04:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
with that and the unable to be provided
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but given that we do
 
04:24:27.269 --> 04:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
want to keep our kids here in New
 
04:24:29.389 --> 04:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we can I think that seems
 
04:24:32.590 --> 04:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable okay um then if you move to
 
04:24:35.309 --> 04:24:35.319 align:start position:0%
line 8 through n it adds the written
 
04:24:37.630 --> 04:24:37.640 align:start position:0%
approval of the director of DCF in
 
04:24:39.189 --> 04:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
addition to the increased judicial
 
04:24:42.990 --> 04:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
oversight so that's a recurring theme
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
um now moving time out so we're
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
referring to increased judicial
 
04:24:49.750 --> 04:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
oversight so there's a part of the
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
amendment or part of the underlying bill
 
04:24:54.950 --> 04:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
because 1573 didn't talk about
 
04:24:57.750 --> 04:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
additional judicial oversight so so
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
where are we in 417 or this amendment
 
04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
that talks about when when we say and
 
04:25:05.149 --> 04:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight that's already in the
 
04:25:08.389 --> 04:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
original it's in the original yeah all
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
right what's been added is the written
 
04:25:15.790 --> 04:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
okay so the written approval I can see a
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
signature on a document by the dcyf
 
04:25:26.870 --> 04:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
director I'm not certain who the
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
signatory authority is to to represent
 
04:25:32.550 --> 04:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
increased judicial
 
04:25:35.469 --> 04:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
oversight so um if you look at the
 
04:25:38.510 --> 04:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
language I would read both and you have
 
04:25:40.550 --> 04:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
the written approval of the director of
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
the DCF
 
04:25:45.429 --> 04:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
and then separate is increased judicial
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
oversight so the problem is it's
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
connected with an and it's it starts
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
with a written approval and then
 
04:25:54.910 --> 04:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
connects two different entities with an
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
and one of them is determinable the
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
director the other one is not I mean I I
 
04:26:03.990 --> 04:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't know who is accountable for the
 
04:26:06.389 --> 04:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
increased judicial oversight to sign
 
04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
something bottom of page three in the
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
original okay so it's I don't think the
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
oversight is a matter of signing a
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
document and if you want to clarify that
 
04:26:14.950 --> 04:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
then we'd probably want to break this
 
04:26:17.070 --> 04:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
more into list form by being able to
 
04:26:19.389 --> 04:26:19.399 align:start position:0%
break out one or two I guess it would be
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
a and b however you would do that I I
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
think I would just delete and judicial
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
oversight increase judicial oversight
 
04:26:29.229 --> 04:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
because we're talking the the word the
 
04:26:31.349 --> 04:26:31.359 align:start position:0%
term is written
 
04:26:34.429 --> 04:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
approval what
 
04:26:34.439 --> 04:26:40.950 align:start position:0%
approval what
what's

04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:45.070 --> 04:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I don't see a signature there
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
finding a written
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
finding this I think the signature is
 
04:26:50.790 --> 04:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
only intended for the director of DCF
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
not a signature for the judicial
 
04:26:55.030 --> 04:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
oversight I think that's a policy where
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
they would need to have the policy of
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
the oversight and specifically requiring
 
04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
the signature so since that's a
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
recurring theme that's probably
 
04:27:04.269 --> 04:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
something we should put a pin in and
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
look at as one of those policy decision
 
04:27:08.389 --> 04:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
one of those decisions that would flow
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
throughout this entire section and
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire Bill okay so so
 
04:27:14.670 --> 04:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
who track my thinking am I am I just
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
wrong here yeah leave it the way he's
 
04:27:18.750 --> 04:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
got it just leave it the way he said it
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all right so it's clear enough
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay now if you move down to
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
line 14 we again um do contrary to the
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
welfare of the
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
child I
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
believe and I apologize I have to find
 
04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
where I am in here because I I touched
 
04:27:41.469 --> 04:27:41.479 align:start position:0%
it and I left the page so now I need to
 
04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
get to
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
correct oh yes I have my uh track
 
04:27:49.030 --> 04:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
document where I lost
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
myself thank goodness I'm used to 40
 
04:27:55.060 --> 04:27:55.070 align:start position:0%
page bills so I can find myself again
 
04:27:55.070 --> 04:27:56.910 align:start position:0%
page bills so I can find myself again
[Music]

04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:27:59.790 --> 04:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay okay there we go I've got that now
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
is six in B so we're going to move to
 
04:28:02.080 --> 04:28:06.269 align:start position:0%
is six in B so we're going to move to
page

04:28:06.269 --> 04:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
department so online three it adds as
 
04:28:15.510 --> 04:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
expressed by the department about the
 
04:28:17.790 --> 04:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
shortage of lack or Foster F La shortage
 
04:28:20.070 --> 04:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
or lack of faser foster family homes nor
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
the lack of Community Based resources as
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
expressed by the department shall be
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable reasons for determinating
 
04:28:27.189 --> 04:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
that the needs can't be in the family
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
setting that gives accountability about
 
04:28:31.349 --> 04:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
who makes that decision that's one that
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
that follow that flows through this in
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
several areas can you refers back to the
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
original bill on where we're at I'm
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
trying like trying to do a side by side
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm trying to do it real time as
 
04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
well I will find it I got it page
 
04:28:47.870 --> 04:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
four you'll see the section B on line 28
 
04:28:51.229 --> 04:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
on the original Bill page
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
four and there's lots of language added
 
04:28:53.920 --> 04:28:57.429 align:start position:0%
four and there's lots of language added
there

04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
nonetheless and that's giving that
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
flexibility and the direction to the
 
04:29:03.109 --> 04:29:03.119 align:start position:0%
court about what to do when that is not
 
04:29:05.070 --> 04:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
available so that's similar to the one
 
04:29:07.670 --> 04:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
we had flagged
 
04:29:09.990 --> 04:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
before and then I
 
04:29:13.710 --> 04:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
believe in dash
 
04:29:16.349 --> 04:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
eight I'll find where it is on here for
 
04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:26.550 --> 04:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
18 yes um page six line I think 16
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
through 18 um that has that same
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
shortage as
 
04:29:34.550 --> 04:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
expressed um and then never nonetheless
 
04:29:38.070 --> 04:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
and that uh conforms
 
04:29:48.429 --> 04:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.670 --> 04:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
here three the the top of page six of
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:07.630 --> 04:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:10.149 --> 04:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
y and I'm happy I think those are the
 
04:30:12.510 --> 04:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
changes I'm happy to look at the itic
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
and how they flow through and put that
 
04:30:15.950 --> 04:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
together as notes afterwards um since we
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
will be coming back because I did that
 
04:30:19.309 --> 04:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
for division one on another large bill I
 
04:30:21.389 --> 04:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
was involved in so so there are multiple
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
Pages thereafter that's all just copy
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
from the underlying bill yeah and even
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
though he's got page seven and eight in
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
the in the U Amendment they're the
 
04:30:34.670 --> 04:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
same okay
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
so it actually doesn't sound like it's
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
all that much more it sounds like it
 
04:30:41.520 --> 04:30:42.429 align:start position:0%
all that much more it sounds like it
it's

04:30:42.429 --> 04:30:42.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:30:45.550 --> 04:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
at in many ways of implementing the
 
04:30:49.630 --> 04:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty Theory um
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
but um all right so at this
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
point uh Miss Manzano
 
04:31:02.750 --> 04:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
Miss masio sorry Manzano I'm gonna turn
 
04:31:05.389 --> 04:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
you into an Italian I
 
04:31:09.030 --> 04:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
think oh that works Manan
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
no um
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%
so okay so I I don't want you to have to
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
redo everything representative leyon did
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
but if you picked up on some things that
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
we missed or or whatever just supplement
 
04:31:26.560 --> 04:31:29.229 align:start position:0%
we missed or or whatever just supplement
don't

04:31:29.229 --> 04:31:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
replace yes so I'm not here to endorse
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment necessarily but I I did
 
04:31:36.990 --> 04:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
have a lengthy conversation with
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
representative H
 
04:31:38.600 --> 04:31:40.510 align:start position:0%
representative H
yesterday

04:31:40.510 --> 04:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
04:31:43.109 --> 04:31:43.119 align:start position:0%
um just a couple things I wanted to
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
point out from U Can I can I time out I
 
04:31:49.349 --> 04:31:49.359 align:start position:0%
would first appreciate it if you would
 
04:31:50.510 --> 04:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
just tell us what you think
 
04:31:52.670 --> 04:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative hole was thinking I think
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
that was what you're about to do I would
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
not even dare no no I want you to wander
 
04:32:01.790 --> 04:32:01.800 align:start position:0%
into that jungle U but but but from
 
04:32:04.670 --> 04:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
there I I do I think we do want to know
 
04:32:07.030 --> 04:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
what you think so but I just want to
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
keep it distinct between explaining what
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
you think he trying to do and keep that
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
distinct from what you the OCA thinks we
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
should do I don't want to get
 
04:32:22.790 --> 04:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
confused the OCA thinks you should adopt
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
the bill as we wrote it but that's a
 
04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
separate story um Christa and I both
 
04:32:30.910 --> 04:32:30.920 align:start position:0%
also had conversations with Aaron cran
 
04:32:32.990 --> 04:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
who unfortunately had to run out so I do
 
04:32:35.189 --> 04:32:35.199 align:start position:0%
know that some of these amendments
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative H had talken to had
 
04:32:39.550 --> 04:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
spoken to Aaron right before he spoke to
 
04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
me so we might also need need to channel
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
Aon crean here because I think some of
 
04:32:47.309 --> 04:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
this language the contrary to the
 
04:32:49.030 --> 04:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
welfare language in particular and that
 
04:32:50.990 --> 04:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
chunk the none the less chunk came from
 
04:32:53.269 --> 04:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary so so Miss Morris I think
 
04:32:55.990 --> 04:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
you're being invited to channel Aaron
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
Creek I feel like between the two of us
 
04:33:01.109 --> 04:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
we can Channel Aaron
 
04:33:01.119 --> 04:33:03.029 align:start position:0%
we can Channel Aaron
um

04:33:03.029 --> 04:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
so as far as that section you guys were
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
just talking about which should be
 
04:33:14.310 --> 04:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.789 --> 04:33:17.799 align:start position:0%
section four can you can you do line
 
04:33:20.670 --> 04:33:20.680 align:start position:0%
item or line numbers because that's
 
04:33:23.789 --> 04:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
easier in representative H's Amendment
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
section one so we're looking at lines 5
 
04:33:32.830 --> 04:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
through 14 that section which should be
 
04:33:32.840 --> 04:33:34.070 align:start position:0%
through 14 that section which should be
identical

04:33:34.070 --> 04:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
identical
 
04:33:34.080 --> 04:33:39.670 align:start position:0%
identical
[Music]

04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
to page 4
 
04:33:47.709 --> 04:33:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:51.470 --> 04:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
n and I think although they are not
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
identical in one of
 
04:33:57.789 --> 04:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
those no instate option exists was
 
04:33:57.799 --> 04:34:01.349 align:start position:0%
those no instate option exists was
crossed

04:34:01.349 --> 04:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
out and new words were put in but they
 
04:34:06.390 --> 04:34:06.400 align:start position:0%
they mean essentially the same thing
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
however that last sentence that you guys
 
04:34:10.510 --> 04:34:10.520 align:start position:0%
were just talking about I think the
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
struggle is in the draft in the original
 
04:34:15.310 --> 04:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
text said any elud placement shall be
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
limited in time and require increased
 
04:34:20.349 --> 04:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight because that
 
04:34:22.230 --> 04:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
references back to that final section of
 
04:34:25.349 --> 04:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
the bill um they then inserted that
 
04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
require the written approval of the
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
director of DCF which is a section from
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
18573 so I think just where it got
 
04:34:34.269 --> 04:34:34.279 align:start position:0%
inserted into the middle of that
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
sentence is Right makes it read weird um
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
but the point was that increased
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight is then described at
 
04:34:45.310 --> 04:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
length in that last section that didn't
 
04:34:47.709 --> 04:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
change that's very long so I think
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
that's why that part's confusing I think
 
04:34:51.551 --> 04:34:51.561 align:start position:0%
you could switch that Clause around and
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
you get what you're looking for Jess
 
04:34:55.310 --> 04:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
should require increas increased
 
04:34:57.109 --> 04:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight and the written
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
approval then I like that because that's
 
04:35:00.990 --> 04:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I was going to say I think
 
04:35:02.109 --> 04:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
it's just the fact that I got stuck in
 
04:35:03.470 --> 04:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
the middle of the sentence made it read
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
really weird I'm an old bureaucrat
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
things have to be signed a document
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be signed I want to know who's
 
04:35:11.189 --> 04:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
going to sign it so nobody's signing
 
04:35:13.349 --> 04:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
anything at the Judiciary based on that
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
sentence so so I like the
 
04:35:20.709 --> 04:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
flip I agree um so this contrary to the
 
04:35:22.510 --> 04:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
welfare language and actually it's also
 
04:35:24.830 --> 04:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
in section two which is Page
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
115 uh lines 17 to 18 that language
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
comes out of current judicial language
 
04:35:36.510 --> 04:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
some of the findings on the forums and I
 
04:35:38.830 --> 04:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
believe it points to Federal language
 
04:35:40.830 --> 04:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
the judges are used to making contrary
 
04:35:42.830 --> 04:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
to the welfare findings it's not
 
04:35:46.349 --> 04:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily A stricter ruling or a
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
heightened standard it's just the
 
04:35:50.070 --> 04:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
language they're used to so I think that
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
came from Miss krian attorney krian the
 
04:35:55.750 --> 04:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill originally was saying best interest
 
04:35:57.789 --> 04:35:57.799 align:start position:0%
of the children because the
 
04:36:00.869 --> 04:36:00.879 align:start position:0%
overarching 169 C language is best
 
04:36:02.670 --> 04:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
interest it's also in
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
451a um so I I think there were many
 
04:36:08.470 --> 04:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
places where the original bill was
 
04:36:10.349 --> 04:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
worded best interest of the child
 
04:36:12.349 --> 04:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
because that is language that's used
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
throughout 169c as that's the primary
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
determining factor is best interest so I
 
04:36:20.470 --> 04:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
believe that was a request um from my
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with both Aaron and
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative h of the Judiciary that
 
04:36:26.949 --> 04:36:26.959 align:start position:0%
the judges might find it confusing that
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
we're using best interest instead of
 
04:36:31.629 --> 04:36:31.639 align:start position:0%
contrary to the welfare um I think in
 
04:36:34.470 --> 04:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
the original drafting Senator Whitley
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
purposefully used best interest as a
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
standard I wouldn't say it's necessarily
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
higher lower equal as contrary to the
 
04:36:42.561 --> 04:36:44.551 align:start position:0%
higher lower equal as contrary to the
welfare

04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
welfare
 
04:36:47.429 --> 04:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
it just has a different flavor and
 
04:36:49.551 --> 04:36:49.561 align:start position:0%
because that is the general overarching
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of
 
04:36:56.109 --> 04:36:56.119 align:start position:0%
169c in this section um the whole every
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
reference is best interest so again
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
that's a policy decision that was made
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
it was a I believe a comment from the
 
04:37:04.750 --> 04:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
Judiciary we don't take a position on
 
04:37:06.750 --> 04:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
that but I did just want to point out I
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
don't believe it was meant to be a
 
04:37:10.670 --> 04:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
higher or different standard it was just
 
04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
language the judici Sherry felt more
 
04:37:16.349 --> 04:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.510 --> 04:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
forms and I think just part of their
 
04:37:20.109 --> 04:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
business pract or not business practice
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
but their practice in general that's it
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
seemed like a comfort level thing
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um in the discussion Tuesday which I
 
04:37:31.150 --> 04:37:31.160 align:start position:0%
understand you weren't here for um
 
04:37:32.789 --> 04:37:32.799 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Edwards
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
there was a lengthy discussion about how
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
to define unique needs um in my
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
conversations with representative who he
 
04:37:43.629 --> 04:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
land am I saying that correctly
 
04:37:45.990 --> 04:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
whole never okay I'm sorry I feel like I
 
04:37:49.709 --> 04:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
say never gotten mad at me every time
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
um I I think D interim director Marie
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
Nunan kind of described what the
 
04:37:58.349 --> 04:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
Department's practices are around unique
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
needs I thought she described it very
 
04:38:03.029 --> 04:38:03.039 align:start position:0%
eloquently these are the words that
 
04:38:05.189 --> 04:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
represent ofh picked out of that
 
04:38:07.070 --> 04:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
discussion they're not necessarily all
 
04:38:09.070 --> 04:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
of the words that were used during that
 
04:38:11.789 --> 04:38:11.799 align:start position:0%
discussion um but I think it was part of
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
those conversations that unique needs
 
04:38:14.119 --> 04:38:15.510 align:start position:0%
those conversations that unique needs
wasn't

04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
04:38:15.520 --> 04:38:18.830 align:start position:0%
wasn't
defined

04:38:18.830 --> 04:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:23.070 --> 04:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
um on page two line
 
04:38:27.269 --> 04:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
26 again I think this was just
 
04:38:30.029 --> 04:38:30.039 align:start position:0%
referencing contrary to the welfare
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
versus best interest obviously the
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
original Bill used the term best
 
04:38:35.990 --> 04:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
interest for
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
reason the kin fictive kin I think you
 
04:38:42.150 --> 04:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
guys have discussed that at length pause
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
just a second uh so what is the current
 
04:38:48.629 --> 04:38:48.639 align:start position:0%
standard in the Judiciary is it contrary
 
04:38:50.269 --> 04:38:50.279 align:start position:0%
to the welfare of the child or best
 
04:38:51.949 --> 04:38:51.959 align:start position:0%
interest of the child what's the what's
 
04:38:53.510 --> 04:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
the standard way it's currently
 
04:38:58.349 --> 04:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
described it it's both are used contrary
 
04:39:00.869 --> 04:39:00.879 align:start position:0%
to the welfare is a specific finding
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the court has to make related to
 
04:39:07.150 --> 04:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
Federal fore funding yeah however best
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
interest is also used throughout 169 see
 
04:39:13.709 --> 04:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
when you're determining the needs of
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
children so I I think because there's
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
that specific contrary to the welfare
 
04:39:20.070 --> 04:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
finding and again I'm sorry tring krian
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
had to leave right that's a term the
 
04:39:27.029 --> 04:39:27.039 align:start position:0%
court has and uses on a checkbox form
 
04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
however best interest is used quite a
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
bit within the statute and was
 
04:39:35.109 --> 04:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
specifically used here for a reason I
 
04:39:37.670 --> 04:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
guess you'd have to ask Senator Whitley
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
um but best interest is the overarching
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
umbrella if you look at the definitions
 
04:39:45.868 --> 04:39:45.878 align:start position:0%
in 169c it is the best interest the
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
safety the well-being the welfare of the
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
child it's not the it's it's not the
 
04:39:54.510 --> 04:39:54.520 align:start position:0%
contrary to the welfare is not used in
 
04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning definition sorry getting
 
04:39:58.110 --> 04:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
lost in the
 
04:40:01.550 --> 04:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
words go ahead um so in looking at that
 
04:40:03.830 --> 04:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
kin fictive kin I think representative
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
Mooney uh called attention to that fact
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
that again um interim director Marie
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
Nunan Tuesday it is a term of artart
 
04:40:14.708 --> 04:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
that is is used in dcyf practice and
 
04:40:19.390 --> 04:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
policy um it is part of kin as defined
 
04:40:19.400 --> 04:40:20.390 align:start position:0%
policy um it is part of kin as defined
in

04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:40:24.670 --> 04:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
17025 which is actually Mis misquoted on
 
04:40:26.430 --> 04:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
page four line
 
04:40:30.190 --> 04:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
15 um you are correct that that
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
definition was read is defined in
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
statute as kin but I believe director
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
Nunan you know testified on Tuesday that
 
04:40:41.550 --> 04:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
fictive Kim is a term of art that is
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
recognized within the agency and used
 
04:40:47.708 --> 04:40:47.718 align:start position:0%
when evaluating because there there is a
 
04:40:49.470 --> 04:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
difference between kin and fictive kin
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
in that typically one's a blood relative
 
04:40:54.190 --> 04:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
and one's not however I think we
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
discussed at length on Tuesday what that
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
difference can
 
04:41:01.670 --> 04:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
mean um so so my reaction to this is
 
04:41:04.190 --> 04:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
still kind of the same sort of uh
 
04:41:06.550 --> 04:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
computer science driven thing if we're
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
going to incorporate by reference a
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
specific RSA then we should be
 
04:41:15.510 --> 04:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with how the RSA defines the
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
term and if there's not a reference for
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
a term we shouldn't be using that term
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
if it needs its own
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
definition what that's a statement but
 
04:41:30.670 --> 04:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
do you have a reaction to that I do not
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
have a reaction to that so so but you're
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
saying 17 the- G25 is a wrong reference
 
04:41:42.190 --> 04:41:42.200 align:start position:0%
170e as an elephant 25 is the correct
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
one on page four line 15 it says G
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
instead of e oh
 
04:41:51.510 --> 04:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
Echo sorry I I like
 
04:41:54.470 --> 04:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
pads okay represent money thank you I
 
04:41:56.550 --> 04:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
have in front of me
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
RSA 170 hyphen e colon 25 then Roman 8
 
04:42:07.470 --> 04:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
which incidentally I think Roman 8
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
should be included in all of these
 
04:42:12.910 --> 04:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
reference RSA references to Ken and I'd
 
04:42:16.230 --> 04:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
like to read it to the committee the
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
definition kin means a child or children
 
04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
who who for which there is a connection
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
or history between a child or their
 
04:42:31.390 --> 04:42:31.400 align:start position:0%
parents and another responsible adult
 
04:42:38.150 --> 04:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.510 --> 04:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
adults show your point
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
I I think we're all getting a
 
04:42:49.470 --> 04:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
long my point is that Roman 8 should be
 
04:42:51.150 --> 04:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
incorporated Incorporated wherever the
 
04:42:54.990 --> 04:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
RSA is and if everyone's in agreement I
 
04:42:57.550 --> 04:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
do I would concur that kin is perhaps
 
04:42:57.560 --> 04:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
do I would concur that kin is perhaps
all

04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
inclusive uh to the language we're
 
04:43:04.030 --> 04:43:04.040 align:start position:0%
looking for because it does reference
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
non blood
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
related adults thank
 
04:43:08.480 --> 04:43:10.110 align:start position:0%
related adults thank
you

04:43:10.110 --> 04:43:10.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:17.670 --> 04:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
this I I I'm hopeful yes this is I think
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
one um all right keep going uh I did
 
04:43:28.910 --> 04:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
Skip something in my excitement about
 
04:43:31.830 --> 04:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
kin and fictive kin um on page we are
 
04:43:33.628 --> 04:43:33.638 align:start position:0%
discussing the amendment though right I
 
04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
mean no but I'm I'm responding to
 
04:43:37.708 --> 04:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
represent wer I I I don't know that
 
04:43:40.030 --> 04:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
we've ever discussed this amendment this
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right all right I I Now
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
understand I'll
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
quit all right got your your point is
 
04:43:55.150 --> 04:43:55.160 align:start position:0%
Wellen keep going um sorry so back to
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
page one
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
um lines 24 to 31 um that
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
section we had a lengthy conversation on
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
Tuesday as well about innocence or guilt
 
04:44:10.310 --> 04:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
this is not a criminal statute 169c is
 
04:44:11.590 --> 04:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
is civil
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
I would point out that all of
 
04:44:18.030 --> 04:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
169c the standard is preponderance of
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
the evidence clear and convincing is a
 
04:44:23.030 --> 04:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
substantially higher criminal type
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
standard that is not used in abuse and
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
neglect cases so it would be a very
 
04:44:32.910 --> 04:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
large deviation from current law and not
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
one that the OCA would be able to
 
04:44:36.910 --> 04:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
support to change that to clear okay so
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
now you're you're crossing over from Yes
 
04:44:41.788 --> 04:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
uh being analytical
 
04:44:45.230 --> 04:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
having an opinion which is fine I just
 
04:44:47.910 --> 04:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
was analytical 169 C all preponderance
 
04:44:50.788 --> 04:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
of the evidence all right
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.670 --> 04:45:00.680 align:start position:0%
of um I I think representative Leon
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
described the changes to G
 
04:45:07.510 --> 04:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
um okay OCA does not agree with that all
 
04:45:10.708 --> 04:45:10.718 align:start position:0%
right are we wrapped up on this um I
 
04:45:14.510 --> 04:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
think the only other part that was
 
04:45:16.030 --> 04:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
discussed so again that contrary to the
 
04:45:19.070 --> 04:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
welfare language goes throughout we did
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
um amongst the advocacy groups talk
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
about that language then nonetheless if
 
04:45:26.948 --> 04:45:26.958 align:start position:0%
there's no kin fictive kin order of
 
04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
placement that the court should make a
 
04:45:31.310 --> 04:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
temporary placement that language was a
 
04:45:33.070 --> 04:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
request of the Judiciary but that
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
language does support the rest of that
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
that paragraph and and sort of follows
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
through to allow the court to say but
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
what do we do if there isn't a placement
 
04:45:44.868 --> 04:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
so that was the same in two
 
04:45:44.878 --> 04:45:47.270 align:start position:0%
so that was the same in two
sections

04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
sections
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
um I think that was a bulk of the
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
conversations that representative hle
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
okay so at this point what I'd like to
 
04:46:03.390 --> 04:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
do is unless somebody really has
 
04:46:06.390 --> 04:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
something more to say on 47 I'd like to
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
park it I'm going to encourage
 
04:46:12.110 --> 04:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
representative H H to listen in on the
 
04:46:14.670 --> 04:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
on the zoom the video of this I'm going
 
04:46:16.670 --> 04:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
to ask representative H to be
 
04:46:19.110 --> 04:46:19.120 align:start position:0%
accountable for whether or not he wants
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
to change his Amendment uh and and then
 
04:46:24.990 --> 04:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday we'll come in part of what
 
04:46:26.110 --> 04:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll listen to
 
04:46:26.120 --> 04:46:27.350 align:start position:0%
we'll do is we'll listen to
representative

04:46:27.350 --> 04:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:46:30.868 --> 04:46:30.878 align:start position:0%
whole relative to his Amendment and and
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I representative wer I just assume
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
wait till Tuesday to to vote on your
 
04:46:40.390 --> 04:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment so that's fine okay so so I
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
think we're done with
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
417 that's
 
04:46:49.150 --> 04:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
456 repayment program for qualified
 
04:46:51.840 --> 04:46:58.590 align:start position:0%
456 repayment program for qualified
nursing

04:46:58.590 --> 04:46:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:03.310 --> 04:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
professionals 456 okay
 
04:47:07.190 --> 04:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
um but um sidebar is good what do we
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.510 --> 04:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
to on my amend oh we'll keep talking and
 
04:47:17.788 --> 04:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
we'll come back Tuesday morning well I'm
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
not going to be here so I will just say
 
04:47:23.708 --> 04:47:23.718 align:start position:0%
that say that um we had discussed
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
something with representative wer that I
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
was supportive of but represent walner
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
and represent wer know my opinion okay
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
so we got a subcommittee of two okay
 
04:47:37.200 --> 04:47:38.948 align:start position:0%
so we got a subcommittee of two okay
um

04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:42.030 --> 04:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
456 um
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
who wants to start talking about
 
04:47:47.470 --> 04:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
this I think this this feels like it it
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:47:51.190 --> 04:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
important but it clashes with some
 
04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
principles of um picking winners and
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
losers and using general funds to pay
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
for reimbursing the loans of college
 
04:48:05.788 --> 04:48:05.798 align:start position:0%
people when lots of people are plumbers
 
04:48:09.430 --> 04:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
and didn't go to college so I I'm I'm
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
I'm a little turned off by SP 456
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
because of that who wants to tell me I'm
 
04:48:19.150 --> 04:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
wrong and why I will go ahead you are
 
04:48:21.910 --> 04:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
are you kidding me you think I'm wrong
 
04:48:24.510 --> 04:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
you knew I was going to raise my hand
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
chman um no I'll just since you were're
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
not here for the public hearing I'll
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
just very briefly um share that this is
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
what I believe is a small
 
04:48:40.110 --> 04:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
$300,000 appropriation to expand the um
 
04:48:43.390 --> 04:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
nurse loan repayment program to try to
 
04:48:47.868 --> 04:48:47.878 align:start position:0%
boost the um uh Workforce situation for
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
nursing Professionals in more rural
 
04:48:52.350 --> 04:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
areas of the state
 
04:48:55.990 --> 04:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
um this would help provide some coverage
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
in areas where there is shortage um we
 
04:49:02.270 --> 04:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
talked about how the maximum Grant would
 
04:49:05.390 --> 04:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
be 75,000 however not all grants are up
 
04:49:09.150 --> 04:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
to that amount um it's somewhat flexible
 
04:49:12.270 --> 04:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
um on what people would would be able to
 
04:49:14.830 --> 04:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
you know qualify for and this is really
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
just a way to help with some of the
 
04:49:19.868 --> 04:49:19.878 align:start position:0%
professional shortages we have in the
 
04:49:21.310 --> 04:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state where they
 
04:49:25.270 --> 04:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
cannot attract enough um workers at the
 
04:49:27.310 --> 04:49:27.320 align:start position:0%
it's an incentive to try to attract
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
people to these rural areas may I ask
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you a question about that then um okay
 
04:49:35.708 --> 04:49:35.718 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it for the purposes
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
of tele medicine we wrote into New
 
04:49:42.430 --> 04:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law that all of New Hampshire
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
is considered Rural and therefore
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%
eligible for tele medicine efforts and
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
so as I look at these definitions of
 
04:49:53.788 --> 04:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
underserved areas it makes me wonder how
 
04:49:56.670 --> 04:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
targeted this would be would would it
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
really be targeted at those zip codes
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps that we know have an lack of
 
04:50:07.390 --> 04:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
Manpower and that we're trying to move
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
the needle in those places that we have
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
known gaps I'm I'm concerned that maybe
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
we're using an overly broad definition
 
04:50:19.070 --> 04:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
and we're bringing in to the
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh you know somebody that's
 
04:50:25.070 --> 04:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
in Rockingham County for example that
 
04:50:27.470 --> 04:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
you know technically Rockingham County
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
is rural but it's really not so so who
 
04:50:33.310 --> 04:50:33.320 align:start position:0%
is there somebody who can speak to the
 
04:50:38.430 --> 04:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
up refer to the online lrp and I think
 
04:50:45.190 --> 04:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
no I've read it that's why I'm concerned
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
because I I see it's referencing
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
definitions and I but I don't know what
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
the detailed definitions are beneath
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
that though hi hi there so I'm all in
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
favor of targeted to make sure that
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
where we have Manpower shortages that
 
04:51:05.070 --> 04:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
this money is being focused on fixing
 
04:51:07.470 --> 04:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
those shortages I want to be careful
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
that we're not wasteful that everyone is
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
eligible by default and we're not using
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
the money to the very best Advantage so
 
04:51:19.390 --> 04:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
what what can you tell us about
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
definitions and the like yeah so um
 
04:51:24.990 --> 04:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
State loan repayment eligibility is
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
limited to um sites and areas that sit
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
in a federally designated shortage area
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not just you know this loose
 
04:51:37.310 --> 04:51:37.320 align:start position:0%
term of rural areas what does that mean
 
04:51:40.110 --> 04:51:40.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we talk about rural
 
04:51:42.910 --> 04:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
because many of our rural areas are
 
04:51:44.670 --> 04:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
designated as medically you sound
 
04:51:46.910 --> 04:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
nervous it's okay this is a very
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
friendly I know
 
04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
I way and then I ease into it it's like
 
04:51:53.788 --> 04:51:53.798 align:start position:0%
this every time all
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
right it's hard when you're sitting
 
04:51:57.628 --> 04:51:57.638 align:start position:0%
there and your heart rate is so low too
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
and um so yes there are strict uh
 
04:52:09.110 --> 04:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines and and uh Federal federally
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
federally excuse me Federal federally
 
04:52:16.910 --> 04:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
designated shortage areas excuse me are
 
04:52:20.270 --> 04:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
based on um provider Supply and
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
population um metrics that reveal a
 
04:52:25.230 --> 04:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
shortage of primary care providers in an
 
04:52:28.590 --> 04:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
area um and as I said you know
 
04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility for the program is
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
restricted primarily to shortage Des
 
04:52:39.708 --> 04:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
shortage areas um because you know that
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
status rites
 
04:52:46.190 --> 04:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
need okay uh for the committee has
 
04:52:48.868 --> 04:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
anyone proposed an amendment my note
 
04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
says that there no amendments were
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
proposed for 456 right okay so um so
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
this to me there there's there's an
 
04:53:02.628 --> 04:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
intriguing and valuable thought behind
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
this you know we we need to make sure
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
the Manpower is deployed to where the
 
04:53:11.390 --> 04:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
needs are totally get that MH you've
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
you've made me a little bit more
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable that it's not a broad brush
 
04:53:19.030 --> 04:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
painting of the state
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay I I think I would like to propose
 
04:53:27.390 --> 04:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
we sunset this and I don't have a sunset
 
04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
length of time in my head right now
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
three years four years so that um so
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
that this program has to be relooked at
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
after we have more experience with it
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
because we have a theory we do X Y will
 
04:53:44.230 --> 04:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
happen right so we're we're spending X
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
and hoping y happens so I'd kind of like
 
04:53:50.590 --> 04:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
to do a Sunset and a report so that we
 
04:53:53.150 --> 04:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
know what
 
04:53:57.510 --> 04:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
happened yeah so um I think what's not
 
04:54:01.070 --> 04:54:01.080 align:start position:0%
clear is that the um amended legislation
 
04:54:05.548 --> 04:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
there's two parts of it um one is to
 
04:54:08.470 --> 04:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate 300,000 towards an existing
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
program that's existed for 25 years
 
04:54:13.948 --> 04:54:13.958 align:start position:0%
years the second component is a report
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
for the state to investigate a separate
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
program that would be stood up to you
 
04:54:23.190 --> 04:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
know solely fund um nurses loan
 
04:54:27.110 --> 04:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
repayment for nurses um irrespective of
 
04:54:30.190 --> 04:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
specialty setting or
 
04:54:33.190 --> 04:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
location so representative Mooney being
 
04:54:35.990 --> 04:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
the left side of my brain uh the
 
04:54:38.270 --> 04:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
analytical side does the sunset in this
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:46.350 --> 04:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
um sure I'm open to that I I can see the
 
04:54:49.070 --> 04:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
value in that um I'd be interested in
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
what other have to say but um it would
 
04:54:55.390 --> 04:54:55.400 align:start position:0%
seem like a maybe a good start could I
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
can I clarify I'm Abby Rogers
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislative Lin could I just ask what
 
04:55:00.788 --> 04:55:00.798 align:start position:0%
the sunset is on the the slurp program
 
04:55:03.110 --> 04:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
the existing program for 25 years or is
 
04:55:05.830 --> 04:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
it on the proposed budget proposal for
 
04:55:07.788 --> 04:55:07.798 align:start position:0%
the additional program that wouldn't the
 
04:55:10.590 --> 04:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
additional incremental program okay so
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
the way we read the legislation at that
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
came over from the Senate is at this
 
04:55:16.590 --> 04:55:16.600 align:start position:0%
point the the one time I think the
 
04:55:18.990 --> 04:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
intent of Senator Ganon was to have a
 
04:55:21.190 --> 04:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
separate program outside of the slurp
 
04:55:22.510 --> 04:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
program that would be administered by
 
04:55:24.350 --> 04:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
the department that would not would
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
apply to those other nurses that were
 
04:55:28.110 --> 04:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
not in the medically underserved or
 
04:55:30.150 --> 04:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
rural areas but this is any any nurse in
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we have this program
 
04:55:34.070 --> 04:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
the slurp program which is for medically
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
underserved areas so that did not look
 
04:55:37.948 --> 04:55:37.958 align:start position:0%
like something that was going to go
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
forward in the Senate and as a result um
 
04:55:42.670 --> 04:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
the compromise was that the Senate
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated 300,000 to go into the
 
04:55:48.030 --> 04:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
existing slurp program with a reporting
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
requirement that the department would
 
04:55:51.868 --> 04:55:51.878 align:start position:0%
come up with a budget proposal and what
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
this other program um to cover nurses
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
that weren't in medically underserved
 
04:55:58.150 --> 04:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
areas might look
 
04:56:02.070 --> 04:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.390 --> 04:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
walner well I she just addressed really
 
04:56:08.070 --> 04:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
what I was going to ask and that is I
 
04:56:09.510 --> 04:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
would not want to see us putting any
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
sort of sunet
 
04:56:12.990 --> 04:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
on the program that we've had for 25
 
04:56:15.830 --> 04:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
years no we want to be very very careful
 
04:56:19.948 --> 04:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
about that okay good represent L I just
 
04:56:21.628 --> 04:56:21.638 align:start position:0%
wanted to say you know this is just an
 
04:56:24.470 --> 04:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
additional $300,000 to the existing
 
04:56:27.390 --> 04:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
program and I guess if you did want to
 
04:56:29.270 --> 04:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
Sunset something I would need some
 
04:56:31.350 --> 04:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
strong clear clarification on what
 
04:56:34.788 --> 04:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
you're sunsetting the increment this
 
04:56:37.990 --> 04:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
program is changing eligibility is it
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
not no expanding the elig
 
04:56:43.430 --> 04:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
no it's just $300 of additional money to
 
04:56:46.990 --> 04:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
the program period that's it yes it's a
 
04:56:49.470 --> 04:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
line item to give them an extra $300,000
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
what you've already spent all the money
 
04:56:52.670 --> 04:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
we gave you already yes that's right all
 
04:56:54.230 --> 04:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
of that's that's the bottom line you've
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
already spent all the money all of the
 
04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
yes all of the um General funds and so
 
04:57:00.548 --> 04:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
you want another 300,000 that is that
 
04:57:04.190 --> 04:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
really what this is no so Senator Ganon
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to expand it to a different a
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
separate Pro parallel program to the
 
04:57:10.670 --> 04:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
slurp program and as a result he uh
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
has an interest in um helping student
 
04:57:15.548 --> 04:57:15.558 align:start position:0%
nurses that need student loan repayment
 
04:57:19.390 --> 04:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
so the Senate said in in addition U that
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't feasible outside of a budget
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
year to consider a separate program but
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
300,000 solely dedicated to nurses um
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
license under one um RSA 326b the nurse
 
04:57:30.430 --> 04:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
PR Practice Act this would be an
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
additional one-time appropriation to our
 
04:57:35.948 --> 04:57:35.958 align:start position:0%
existing program to support just nurses
 
04:57:38.948 --> 04:57:38.958 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments represent
 
04:57:40.830 --> 04:57:40.840 align:start position:0%
string well just comment there's there's
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
no money to write the report that's due
 
04:57:45.590 --> 04:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
by November 1st but I imagine the
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
department can handle it but uh in the
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
existing appropriation but I think the
 
04:57:53.948 --> 04:57:53.958 align:start position:0%
idea is to is to look at expanding it
 
04:57:55.310 --> 04:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
and somebody's going to write a report
 
04:57:58.190 --> 04:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
the 300,000 entirely goes into the
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
existing yeah loan loan forgiveness
 
04:58:03.670 --> 04:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
program representative f it looks like
 
04:58:06.788 --> 04:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.510 --> 04:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
question well first of all I I I thought
 
04:58:11.548 --> 04:58:11.558 align:start position:0%
some explaining the this the funding of
 
04:58:13.390 --> 04:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
this slurp is that what you call it yeah
 
04:58:16.390 --> 04:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
is federal is that correct no that's
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's just generally funded so where did
 
04:58:21.830 --> 04:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
I get that misimpression there is
 
04:58:24.590 --> 04:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
Chairman there are federal state loan
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
repayment programs we uh developed our
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
own to sort of avoid those prescriptive
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um you know guidelines they don't pay
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
for administrative support also which of
 
04:58:36.670 --> 04:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
course you need Administration to run
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
the program um and so we yep built our
 
04:58:42.990 --> 04:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
own 25 years ago and this is a
 
04:58:46.030 --> 04:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
$75,000 per person which means really
 
04:58:48.350 --> 04:58:48.360 align:start position:0%
four people could suck it all up um the
 
04:58:51.070 --> 04:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
75,000 is for tier one providers that
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
actually does exclude aprns um aprns are
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
tier 2 RNs are tier three um really it
 
04:59:00.310 --> 04:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
would be funding about six contracts
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
which doesn't sound significant unless
 
04:59:04.190 --> 04:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
you really look you know break it down
 
04:59:07.110 --> 04:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the numbers um the average number of
 
04:59:10.430 --> 04:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
patients that an APRN a primary care a
 
04:59:13.670 --> 04:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
he that day is about 15 multiply that by
 
04:59:16.150 --> 04:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
number of you know working days a year
 
04:59:19.430 --> 04:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
3,900 times that by six that's about
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
25,000 um patients that would be
 
04:59:23.788 --> 04:59:23.798 align:start position:0%
impacted through this
 
04:59:27.030 --> 04:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
expansion and so I I'm I also serve on
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
the Hillsboro County um executive
 
04:59:31.628 --> 04:59:31.638 align:start position:0%
committee and there are quite a
 
04:59:34.110 --> 04:59:34.120 align:start position:0%
few programs at least in Hillsboro I'm
 
04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
guessing across the state for nurse
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
training for instance the the County
 
04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
nursing home here does it for they pay
 
04:59:44.430 --> 04:59:44.440 align:start position:0%
you to do it and they you so
 
04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
are is this really is this program
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
really necessary given all the other
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
programs that are in place for
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
specifically for bringing nurses up and
 
04:59:54.310 --> 04:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
and training them yes because it's to
 
04:59:56.670 --> 04:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
incentivize these Primary Care Providers
 
04:59:59.230 --> 04:59:59.240 align:start position:0%
to practice in locations that there is a
 
05:00:01.750 --> 05:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
dir of primary care providers such as
 
05:00:04.990 --> 05:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
Rural and medically underserved
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
areas you say pcps I think that as a
 
05:00:08.910 --> 05:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
doctor you're talking about nurses
 
05:00:11.390 --> 05:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
though right yep y aprns and Primary
 
05:00:13.628 --> 05:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
Care RNs also that work in an outpatient
 
05:00:16.430 --> 05:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
setting um in again those underserved
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
areas such as where uh Coos County just
 
05:00:23.830 --> 05:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
about every every town in Coos County um
 
05:00:25.510 --> 05:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
many most of New Hampshire I don't have
 
05:00:27.390 --> 05:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
a map for you today but most of New
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um is designated as Rural and
 
05:00:32.430 --> 05:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
not to say every rural not to say every
 
05:00:34.628 --> 05:00:34.638 align:start position:0%
rural um area is also medically
 
05:00:36.270 --> 05:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
underserved but that's sort of where we
 
05:00:38.470 --> 05:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
point to the federal definition of a
 
05:00:41.230 --> 05:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
shortage area because you know calculate
 
05:00:43.708 --> 05:00:43.718 align:start position:0%
that they use these metrics to you know
 
05:00:46.548 --> 05:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
determine that status so we fall back on
 
05:00:48.470 --> 05:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
that and not you know reinvent the wheel
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
do it again because they have sort of
 
05:00:53.830 --> 05:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
strict um guidelines that that are
 
05:00:55.788 --> 05:00:55.798 align:start position:0%
formulated into that
 
05:00:57.868 --> 05:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
calculation thank you if I could add an
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
addition I think some of the
 
05:01:01.030 --> 05:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
conversation in the Senate hearing was
 
05:01:04.270 --> 05:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
around um helping nurses maybe start
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
their careers in New Hampshire with this
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
assistance and and choose to stay here
 
05:01:09.670 --> 05:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
and continue their careers and and stay
 
05:01:09.680 --> 05:01:11.948 align:start position:0%
and continue their careers and and stay
in

05:01:11.948 --> 05:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
state right but you're not trying to
 
05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
just get some to stay in the state
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
because obviously we have a lot of
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
programs specifically specifically for
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
that and they're from my understand
 
05:01:21.910 --> 05:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
working very well you're trying to get
 
05:01:21.920 --> 05:01:22.628 align:start position:0%
working very well you're trying to get
them

05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:01:26.310 --> 05:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
to Canada essentially not to Canada but
 
05:01:28.830 --> 05:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
up to that part of the state well there
 
05:01:30.070 --> 05:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
are this also covers I believe
 
05:01:32.110 --> 05:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Specialists there are
 
05:01:35.590 --> 05:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
areas even in Nashua and Manchester um
 
05:01:37.430 --> 05:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers that
 
05:01:40.150 --> 05:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
utilize these providers um because they
 
05:01:41.788 --> 05:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
serve an underserved
 
05:01:43.708 --> 05:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
population okay I find it hard to
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
believe you're having a problem getting
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
people in NASA because that's part of
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County and I know we have
 
05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
these programs nurses have a lot of
 
05:01:53.150 --> 05:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
competing priorities at this time I
 
05:01:54.230 --> 05:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
think what was what came up in the
 
05:01:55.990 --> 05:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing was losing New Hampshire
 
05:01:57.708 --> 05:01:57.718 align:start position:0%
nurses to traveling nurse opportunities
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
where the the pay is a lot can be a lot
 
05:02:03.350 --> 05:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
greater to leave the state I get that
 
05:02:04.990 --> 05:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
but how's this going to address that
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
problem well it's just an additional
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
funding source that the program would
 
05:02:10.708 --> 05:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
have to to support nurses that need some
 
05:02:12.310 --> 05:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
student loan repayment but this is just
 
05:02:13.708 --> 05:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
to get them trained
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
correct no this is this is for providers
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
to practice in an area the contracts are
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
three years for full-time with um the
 
05:02:23.390 --> 05:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of funding is available for
 
05:02:26.030 --> 05:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
an additional two uh two years for a
 
05:02:28.270 --> 05:02:28.280 align:start position:0%
contract extension and that's sort of go
 
05:02:29.590 --> 05:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
ahead so these are nurses that are
 
05:02:33.150 --> 05:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
already nurses yes and so what did you
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
say was the the the kind of people the
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
pcps yeah out patient Primary Care
 
05:02:38.910 --> 05:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
Providers what would they be gen so what
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
how much would they get
 
05:02:41.830 --> 05:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
as an
 
05:02:43.948 --> 05:02:43.958 align:start position:0%
example um I don't know if I've
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
memorized here too we could probably
 
05:02:47.350 --> 05:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
talking ballpark you're talking about
 
05:02:48.830 --> 05:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
supplementing their salary is that
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
really what all this is doing as opposed
 
05:02:50.240 --> 05:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
really what all this is doing as opposed
to

05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:02:53.830 --> 05:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
training it's no it's not supplementing
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
salary it it it would be to you know
 
05:03:00.788 --> 05:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
help with that burden of of it would Hur
 
05:03:02.590 --> 05:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
it would help with a loan burden
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
basically to incentivize them to
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
practice in these areas you know that
 
05:03:10.310 --> 05:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
are hard to get providers to practice in
 
05:03:12.030 --> 05:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
and don't pay as much as so they've
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
already paid for their training
 
05:03:17.030 --> 05:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
yes and you believe this is going to get
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
them to it does it's actually a
 
05:03:24.430 --> 05:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized um uh program that
 
05:03:26.470 --> 05:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
is used as a tool throughout the nation
 
05:03:27.628 --> 05:03:27.638 align:start position:0%
that's why we have the National Health
 
05:03:30.110 --> 05:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
Service Corp um and the state loan
 
05:03:32.310 --> 05:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
repayment program for for all of our
 
05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
states um because of of the evidence
 
05:03:37.430 --> 05:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
that suggests it is a powerful
 
05:03:41.470 --> 05:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention tool
 
05:03:43.788 --> 05:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
I think you should talk to some of the
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
other like for instance hsbor County
 
05:03:47.548 --> 05:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
nursing home about the approaches that
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
they take because really what we're
 
05:03:50.708 --> 05:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
talking about is in my mind is bringing
 
05:03:52.070 --> 05:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
the nurses in whether they're already
 
05:03:54.628 --> 05:03:54.638 align:start position:0%
nurses or not already nurses getting
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
them trained and or if not necessarily
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
getting trained bringing them in but if
 
05:04:01.030 --> 05:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
you can train them on the job which is
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
what we do um you know that sounds like
 
05:04:05.430 --> 05:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
a more effective Approach at least it
 
05:04:06.510 --> 05:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
seems more effective all you're talking
 
05:04:08.628 --> 05:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
about here is a half a dozen people I
 
05:04:10.390 --> 05:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
mean you get a lot of pay patients down
 
05:04:12.110 --> 05:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
the road but we're talking about people
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
not not patients this is a this would be
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
a supplemental appropriation to what the
 
05:04:17.350 --> 05:04:17.360 align:start position:0%
funding that we already do have through
 
05:04:19.230 --> 05:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
the program to to to fund some
 
05:04:21.788 --> 05:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
additional nursing recruits which I
 
05:04:23.548 --> 05:04:23.558 align:start position:0%
thought you said was run
 
05:04:26.110 --> 05:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
out it has that's right all of the
 
05:04:28.548 --> 05:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
general funds for State fiscal year 25
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
have been committed um so it would just
 
05:04:32.990 --> 05:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
expand I mean we do though have 100
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
contracts within the state so it would
 
05:04:38.590 --> 05:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
just well I okay I'm confused with that
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
term contracts
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
you're talking about basically helping
 
05:04:47.470 --> 05:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
contract the contract to participate in
 
05:04:51.868 --> 05:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
the state loan repayment program so
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
between the state and the provider that
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
that they would move to Coos County get
 
05:04:59.548 --> 05:04:59.558 align:start position:0%
a sign a contract for a job to work
 
05:05:03.390 --> 05:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
there for three years and be able to
 
05:05:05.990 --> 05:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
benefit from this program to have
 
05:05:08.310 --> 05:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
assistance in paying their loans that
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
allowed them to get their degree
 
05:05:12.470 --> 05:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay I guess I'm just still not
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
convinced this is the best way to bring
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
in more
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
nurses well if I may go ahead represent
 
05:05:20.990 --> 05:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
ly what I just feel like we had a very
 
05:05:22.750 --> 05:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
in-depth conversation at the public
 
05:05:24.830 --> 05:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and uh or I'm sorry it
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
was a work session but on Tuesday and I
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
thought it was very enlightening and
 
05:05:31.230 --> 05:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's a unique way to draw those
 
05:05:33.868 --> 05:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
providers into those areas where we have
 
05:05:36.590 --> 05:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
people who can't get medical care they
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
can't drive 90 minutes 3 hours hours
 
05:05:42.510 --> 05:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
down to um get an appointment and we
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
just heard I I'm happy you shared those
 
05:05:47.590 --> 05:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
that those numbers that this potentially
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
could have
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
25,000 uh patient visits which I think
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
would have a huge impact on these areas
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
that they're not they just don't have
 
05:05:57.548 --> 05:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
access to Medical Care so so I see the
 
05:06:00.590 --> 05:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
theory you know and and some rough
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
correlation between bringing in new
 
05:06:06.070 --> 05:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
providers and additional patients being
 
05:06:09.350 --> 05:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
served I get I I I get that I I I it
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
does doesn't sound to me like this
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
program is assured to deliver on that
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
though if this is essentially an in an
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
incremental benefit they're it's not
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursing them for college that
 
05:06:22.830 --> 05:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to it's it's it's an
 
05:06:26.110 --> 05:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
additional benefit for
 
05:06:31.230 --> 05:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
them it ties them to this area that is
 
05:06:35.190 --> 05:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
in such high need of providers yeah and
 
05:06:40.190 --> 05:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
it says come and work in gorum or LAN
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
so let's say I'm a I'm already working
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
in in location x and x is one of these
 
05:06:48.788 --> 05:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
underserved underman places let's let's
 
05:06:52.948 --> 05:06:52.958 align:start position:0%
just say x and can am I eligible for to
 
05:06:54.948 --> 05:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
sign this contract and to get this money
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
if I'm already INX yes you would be but
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
typically we don't see that we see new
 
05:07:03.430 --> 05:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
providers coming in um for employment
 
05:07:05.110 --> 05:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
because when you've worked somewhere for
 
05:07:07.628 --> 05:07:07.638 align:start position:0%
an extended period of time typically
 
05:07:09.628 --> 05:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
you've you know already paid your loans
 
05:07:12.390 --> 05:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
back also so it's possible but we don't
 
05:07:14.070 --> 05:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
see it it's typically you know new
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
providers that were recruiting to an
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
area and the reason they chose that you
 
05:07:20.150 --> 05:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
know employer that practice site is
 
05:07:23.788 --> 05:07:23.798 align:start position:0%
because of this um incentive to also you
 
05:07:26.430 --> 05:07:26.440 align:start position:0%
know have their loans um paid as well so
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
so why is 300,000 the right number it
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like you you you know six people
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
who are left out in the cold and you're
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
trying to cover six you probably have a
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
by name list of six people right I I
 
05:07:40.548 --> 05:07:40.558 align:start position:0%
think the history was that uh the the
 
05:07:43.110 --> 05:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
program the this completely parallel
 
05:07:45.030 --> 05:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
program that was in that was suggested
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
in the original Bill had a fiscal note
 
05:07:50.030 --> 05:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
of1 18 million to set up a parallel
 
05:07:51.590 --> 05:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
program to the one that we have now so
 
05:07:53.390 --> 05:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate thought that was not going to
 
05:07:55.750 --> 05:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
go forward outside of a budget year with
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
some technical issues to work out so
 
05:08:01.030 --> 05:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
300,000 would support x amount of nurses
 
05:08:03.510 --> 05:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
for until the end of the banum to give
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
something extra to the program because
 
05:08:07.150 --> 05:08:07.160 align:start position:0%
we're so of the six additional people
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
that you probably have roughly
 
05:08:13.708 --> 05:08:13.718 align:start position:0%
identified already by name
 
05:08:16.548 --> 05:08:16.558 align:start position:0%
no no we don't have any money right I
 
05:08:18.270 --> 05:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
know but they can still apply and you
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
can say hey I don't have any money they
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
haven't okay I I'm just trying to make
 
05:08:28.708 --> 05:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
sure that I understand why 300,000 why
 
05:08:31.150 --> 05:08:31.160 align:start position:0%
six that was a decision that the Senate
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the committee that was
 
05:08:34.948 --> 05:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
just a decision yes it was so if we just
 
05:08:37.628 --> 05:08:37.638 align:start position:0%
decided 150 that would just be another
 
05:08:37.638 --> 05:08:39.948 align:start position:0%
decided 150 that would just be another
decision

05:08:39.948 --> 05:08:39.958 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
right yes all right representa wer most
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
of us that heard the original
 
05:08:48.110 --> 05:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
presentation were quickly convinced that
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
this had enough safeguards we have a
 
05:08:51.270 --> 05:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
report that's going to come in it's
 
05:08:53.470 --> 05:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
going to tell us what was the effect how
 
05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
many were affected did it help how many
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
visits stays and so on that was the that
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
was what we heard and I don't think any
 
05:09:02.830 --> 05:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
of us felt we needed to amend it or
 
05:09:04.990 --> 05:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
argue about it it just seemed like a
 
05:09:07.590 --> 05:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable thing to do it's it's
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
attached to a existing program that's
 
05:09:12.110 --> 05:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
been pretty successful but not enough
 
05:09:14.788 --> 05:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
money so we put another 300,000 see what
 
05:09:17.230 --> 05:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
an effect it had and see how it worked
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
out we've we've done this several places
 
05:09:22.150 --> 05:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
I remember in my County we were training
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
lnas and we said you we'll send spend
 
05:09:26.708 --> 05:09:26.718 align:start position:0%
this money training you but you'll have
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
to either sign up for a contract or pay
 
05:09:32.030 --> 05:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
for the training and here comes exit to
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
hospital hey come work for us for
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
another Buck an hour and we'll pay this
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
money that you have to pay back that's
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of thing where so they
 
05:09:42.590 --> 05:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
do contracts and hopefully they're
 
05:09:46.110 --> 05:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
tighter than what we did at so so so far
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
we voted to spend another $7 million out
 
05:09:52.350 --> 05:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
of um out of cycle I just wanted to put
 
05:09:54.590 --> 05:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
that Benchmark out of there but it also
 
05:09:56.030 --> 05:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
sounds like you have a motion you want
 
05:09:58.030 --> 05:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
to make do you do you want to make a
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
motion I'll move on to pass I'll second
 
05:10:04.230 --> 05:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay so um do you want to when
 
05:10:11.110 --> 05:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
yes this is House Bill
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%

uh the judicial and the child protection
 
05:13:03.708 --> 05:13:03.718 align:start position:0%
uh agencies on uh Tuesday of this week
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative and Mooney and I decided
 
05:13:09.708 --> 05:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
that it would be best if we
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
con kind of Consolidated our thoughts
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
into one
 
05:13:16.910 --> 05:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the language um that we
 
05:13:19.670 --> 05:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to add
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
into uh section two of the
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
basically takes that section but adds in
 
05:13:35.548 --> 05:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
um and that's starting at line six if an
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
attorney is not available for
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
appointment the court May proceed with
 
05:13:46.230 --> 05:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
the litigation until an attorney becomes
 
05:13:49.150 --> 05:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
available under appropriate
 
05:13:51.750 --> 05:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances the court may consider
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
appointing a non attorney to a
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
temporary represent the child's express
 
05:14:02.910 --> 05:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
interest until the attorney becomes
 
05:14:05.868 --> 05:14:05.878 align:start position:0%
available the court may consider whether
 
05:14:09.868 --> 05:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
it is it is possible to prioritize
 
05:14:12.910 --> 05:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
consideration of legal issues that do
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
not affect the child's express interest
 
05:14:18.830 --> 05:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
until the attorney becomes
 
05:14:22.708 --> 05:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
available um this was because we heard
 
05:14:26.470 --> 05:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the testimony that in order to do
 
05:14:30.590 --> 05:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
this the objective objectives of this
 
05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
bill there wasn't a need for additional
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing at
 
05:14:39.150 --> 05:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
DHHS there is or is not there there is
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
not to do this to start up this program
 
05:14:47.190 --> 05:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
and to um to see the effectiveness so
 
05:14:51.110 --> 05:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we put this paragraph in MH
 
05:14:54.310 --> 05:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
the second part was to amend the bill
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking out section
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
four and then ruming it section four was
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
the Staffing of this
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
bill and that is the amendment is there
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
is there there is no fiscal cost okay is
 
05:15:11.670 --> 05:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
there discussion on
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
this m Miss
 
05:15:16.150 --> 05:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg uh do you do you have anything
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
you want to add you don't have to but
 
05:15:20.160 --> 05:15:20.170 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you an
 
05:15:20.170 --> 05:15:26.708 align:start position:0%
I'm just giving you an
[Music]

05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity um thank thank you for um
 
05:15:31.990 --> 05:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
recognizing me I'm Karen rosberg policy
 
05:15:34.430 --> 05:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
director disability rights Center I'm
 
05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
Emily Lawrence I'm the deputy advocacy
 
05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
director with Waypoint um so just
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
getting my head around this I think that
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
we expected the removal or substantial
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
amendment of section four of the bill
 
05:15:51.548 --> 05:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
recognizing that um the fiscal note
 
05:15:53.510 --> 05:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
seemed although there was no fiscal
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
impact for this banm that the fiscal
 
05:15:59.270 --> 05:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
note going forward seemed hugely
 
05:16:02.830 --> 05:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
inflated given that there's all of the
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the requirements are
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
actually already embedded in either
 
05:16:09.708 --> 05:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
federal law or current DCF policy
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
um what I'm having difficulty with
 
05:16:16.670 --> 05:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
though is this is the um provision above
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
that would basically establish a right
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
but not really establish a right can you
 
05:16:24.590 --> 05:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
stick your finger on the line item yeah
 
05:16:27.868 --> 05:16:27.878 align:start position:0%
so um I'm looking at the um proposed
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
amendment and starting at line
 
05:16:34.708 --> 05:16:34.718 align:start position:0%
six if an attorney is not available for
 
05:16:36.350 --> 05:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
appointment the court May proceed with
 
05:16:38.350 --> 05:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
the litigation until attorney an
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
attorney becomes
 
05:16:43.350 --> 05:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
available and under appropriate
 
05:16:45.190 --> 05:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances the court may consider
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
appointing a non- attorney to
 
05:16:48.310 --> 05:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
temporarily represent the child's
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
expressed interest until an attorney
 
05:16:49.760 --> 05:16:50.750 align:start position:0%
expressed interest until an attorney
becomes

05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
available um I mean the rest of it just
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
flows from there like that section so
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
what is really concerning is that um
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
this bill as as um it came to you was
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
extremely narrowly tailored to recognize
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
that children who are placed in
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
institutional settings are the most
 
05:17:15.150 --> 05:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
vulnerable of this segment of children
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that it is a Paramount importance
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
that those children have counsil to
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
represent their expressed
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
interests and um New Hampshire is an
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
outlier here we're the one of only six
 
05:17:30.788 --> 05:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
states in the whole country that never
 
05:17:32.430 --> 05:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
ever provide a right to counsel for
 
05:17:36.070 --> 05:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
children and so in narrowly tailoring
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
this um bill that as it came to you
 
05:17:42.030 --> 05:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
the idea was that we are going to pick
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
only the most you know the most
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children in the most
 
05:17:49.990 --> 05:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
vulnerable situations whose rights to
 
05:17:52.030 --> 05:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
family Integrity to being able to live
 
05:17:53.628 --> 05:17:53.638 align:start position:0%
in their homes and communities to be
 
05:17:55.230 --> 05:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
able to attend their schools like these
 
05:17:57.868 --> 05:17:57.878 align:start position:0%
very fundamental aspects of a child's
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
life when those are being removed or
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
threatened to be removed that that is of
 
05:18:05.190 --> 05:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
such importance that Council ought to be
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
appointed what this um Amendment would
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
do is basically say well we don't really
 
05:18:15.270 --> 05:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
mean that um because we're we're because
 
05:18:18.990 --> 05:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
it provides an out it says well you know
 
05:18:20.830 --> 05:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
if we can't find someone then you're not
 
05:18:23.230 --> 05:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
going to have this right and in every
 
05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
other case where coun where the
 
05:18:27.390 --> 05:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
legislature the US Supreme Court have
 
05:18:29.990 --> 05:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
determined that someone is entitled to
 
05:18:32.750 --> 05:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
courta appointed counsel those cases
 
05:18:35.750 --> 05:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
don't proceed until council is appointed
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
so you know in a criminal case in a
 
05:18:41.788 --> 05:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
juvenile case where like a juvenile
 
05:18:44.830 --> 05:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
delinquency case where kids are entitled
 
05:18:47.190 --> 05:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
to counsel because they may lose their
 
05:18:48.670 --> 05:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
Liberty they may be removed from their
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
parents' homes they may be um you know
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
placed in an Institutional setting in
 
05:18:57.030 --> 05:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
the juvenal case where the behavior is
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
technically that child's you know
 
05:19:02.868 --> 05:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
valtion if they're found true they get
 
05:19:04.830 --> 05:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
an attorney but in this case it would be
 
05:19:06.190 --> 05:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
saying well we think this is an
 
05:19:08.190 --> 05:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
important right you're here for no
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
reason that you didn't cause this you
 
05:19:12.948 --> 05:19:12.958 align:start position:0%
didn't cause your parents to abuse you
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
right it's not this is this isn't your
 
05:19:18.270 --> 05:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't your doing um but you know
 
05:19:20.270 --> 05:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to take you out of your home
 
05:19:21.350 --> 05:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to remove you from your
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
school we're going to put you in an
 
05:19:24.990 --> 05:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
institution and although we think that's
 
05:19:26.270 --> 05:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
really important for kids who are in the
 
05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency system that they
 
05:19:31.548 --> 05:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
have counsel maybe not for you I think I
 
05:19:34.868 --> 05:19:34.878 align:start position:0%
hear the concern about you know are we
 
05:19:36.868 --> 05:19:36.878 align:start position:0%
going to have an adequate pool of
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
attorneys but this Bill does not become
 
05:19:43.310 --> 05:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
effective for over a year from now there
 
05:19:46.430 --> 05:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
is plenty of time to gear up here and
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about hordes of
 
05:19:51.190 --> 05:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
Children Here currently there are about
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
124 children who would be appointed
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
counsel so I'm really finding this very
 
05:20:00.310 --> 05:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
very difficult okay thank you thank you
 
05:20:02.868 --> 05:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
for your comments I I'm going to let
 
05:20:06.190 --> 05:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney and priest um
 
05:20:08.868 --> 05:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
explain what they think this does but as
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
I've read it and I've just seen it what
 
05:20:12.948 --> 05:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm reading is a little
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
different than what I heard you describe
 
05:20:18.310 --> 05:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh I what I'm what I'm reading is that
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
we really want to create a client
 
05:20:23.990 --> 05:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
attorney relationship in these cases but
 
05:20:26.350 --> 05:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
in the harsh negative reality of there
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
not being an attorney involved that we
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
would like to continue to process the
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
cases uh with the flexibility and the
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
guidance to the Judiciary that they
 
05:20:42.750 --> 05:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
should postpone or or set aside the most
 
05:20:45.150 --> 05:20:45.160 align:start position:0%
critical issues if they think a council
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
could be determinative and how that case
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
gets resolved and if and if that's true
 
05:20:54.190 --> 05:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
then you know I it feels to me like we
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
we we want there to be an an attorney
 
05:21:00.070 --> 05:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
present but in case there isn't let's
 
05:21:02.270 --> 05:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
keep moving forward and if there's
 
05:21:05.190 --> 05:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
something critical you know then let's
 
05:21:07.150 --> 05:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
let's postpone that case until we can
 
05:21:09.030 --> 05:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
get legal counsel assigned that that's
 
05:21:10.708 --> 05:21:10.718 align:start position:0%
the way I read this representative
 
05:21:12.150 --> 05:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
priest do you do you want to comment
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
since you your this is your bill yeah
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
you you basically uh summarized it very
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
well and that was our purpose we saw the
 
05:21:23.948 --> 05:21:23.958 align:start position:0%
need for this the need is there we see
 
05:21:26.190 --> 05:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
the need for attorneys representing
 
05:21:29.628 --> 05:21:29.638 align:start position:0%
these children but if an attorney isn't
 
05:21:34.310 --> 05:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
available at that time then we'll we'll
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
find someone to help process their
 
05:21:41.708 --> 05:21:41.718 align:start position:0%
concerns until an attorney can be found
 
05:21:43.548 --> 05:21:43.558 align:start position:0%
I mean that was the that was the
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
objective yeah do you we're not
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
dismissing these children right I agree
 
05:21:50.350 --> 05:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
I I I hear you I I hear the emotion in
 
05:21:52.830 --> 05:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
your voice too so so it's okay
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney do you do you you
 
05:21:58.708 --> 05:21:58.718 align:start position:0%
work together what would would you
 
05:22:01.510 --> 05:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
classify what this any differently than
 
05:22:03.510 --> 05:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
it's been described but no I concur with
 
05:22:05.390 --> 05:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lawyer shortage for
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
quite some time now in New Hampshire
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
that is a reality I would be interested
 
05:22:10.590 --> 05:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
in hearing Miss
 
05:22:13.310 --> 05:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
krian thank you so miss krian you're on
 
05:22:15.110 --> 05:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
Deck you're going to come up but
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner do you do you
 
05:22:19.708 --> 05:22:19.718 align:start position:0%
have comment no I just I have a question
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if this has come up
 
05:22:24.670 --> 05:22:24.680 align:start position:0%
either an amendment like this or this
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
concept has come up in any of the other
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
uh policy committees that this has gone
 
05:22:33.070 --> 05:22:33.080 align:start position:0%
through I mean has anyone else looked at
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
this the idea that we're
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
short the idea that they're is could be
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty recruiting attorneys I think
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's something that did come up however
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that was to
 
05:22:49.150 --> 05:22:49.160 align:start position:0%
postpone the effective date for a year
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's I think that's no guarantee though
 
05:22:53.390 --> 05:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
right if I could just say there was an
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that was brought in children
 
05:22:57.830 --> 05:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
and family law that was had um one of I
 
05:23:00.110 --> 05:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
think similar to one of the lines here
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
and that was not passed by children and
 
05:23:02.320 --> 05:23:04.430 align:start position:0%
and that was not passed by children and
family

05:23:04.430 --> 05:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
family
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
law followup representative lski
 
05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you I know I know this is
 
05:23:14.230 --> 05:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
an important subject you and I have
 
05:23:18.230 --> 05:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
talked about this offline and I I I I
 
05:23:19.708 --> 05:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to move in a
 
05:23:22.788 --> 05:23:22.798 align:start position:0%
direction that addresses the concern in
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
a reality-based
 
05:23:28.548 --> 05:23:28.558 align:start position:0%
world um I mean I I I hear what you're
 
05:23:31.910 --> 05:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
saying I guess I mean one thing that I
 
05:23:34.548 --> 05:23:34.558 align:start position:0%
that I mean I and I also see what where
 
05:23:37.470 --> 05:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're heading I I mean I I understand
 
05:23:40.030 --> 05:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
where you're going representative priest
 
05:23:42.590 --> 05:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think that you know while this would
 
05:23:44.548 --> 05:23:44.558 align:start position:0%
provide the court may consider whether
 
05:23:47.190 --> 05:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's possible um to prioritize
 
05:23:48.670 --> 05:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
consideration of other legal issues it
 
05:23:51.190 --> 05:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't wouldn't require that and also
 
05:23:53.430 --> 05:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
the idea that a non-attorney I think we
 
05:23:56.310 --> 05:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
need trained attorneys like any other
 
05:23:58.590 --> 05:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
really fundamental right someone who's
 
05:24:00.948 --> 05:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
entitled to an attorney needs to be able
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
to have a trained attorney it's possible
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
that there could be training for
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
non-attorneys and that could be a
 
05:24:07.510 --> 05:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
separate matter but I I I don't know it
 
05:24:09.230 --> 05:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
feels very late in the game before
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's all figured out to be amending
 
05:24:11.760 --> 05:24:12.590 align:start position:0%
that's all figured out to be amending
this

05:24:12.590 --> 05:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
soly would you believe that I sat on
 
05:24:17.470 --> 05:24:17.480 align:start position:0%
corporate legal offices as a non-
 
05:24:20.190 --> 05:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
attorney as a worldwide subject matter
 
05:24:23.150 --> 05:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
expert on privacy and I didn't need to
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
be an attorney to be a worldwide expert
 
05:24:28.868 --> 05:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are programs now
 
05:24:30.310 --> 05:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
even in our state that allow
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
non-attorney Advocates to appear in
 
05:24:34.948 --> 05:24:34.958 align:start position:0%
court um in certain matters
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
so I think I'm just not I don't have my
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
head around that yet for this one it
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
seems like a pretty big departure from
 
05:24:43.030 --> 05:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
where the policy committee had been on
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
this all right thank you are there any
 
05:24:48.788 --> 05:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
other questions from division three then
 
05:24:48.798 --> 05:24:51.948 align:start position:0%
other questions from division three then
miss

05:24:51.948 --> 05:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.868 --> 05:24:54.878 align:start position:0%
krian and I'm not thank you so much both
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
of you for coming
 
05:24:59.788 --> 05:24:59.798 align:start position:0%
up what what would you like to tell us
 
05:25:02.670 --> 05:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
about this good afternoon Mr chair
 
05:25:04.670 --> 05:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
members of committee thank you very much
 
05:25:06.830 --> 05:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
for considering this amendment uh this
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
is a this is a practical limit itation
 
05:25:10.150 --> 05:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
for the courts that we simply want to
 
05:25:11.548 --> 05:25:11.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have direction from
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature about what we do if an
 
05:25:16.590 --> 05:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
extremely likely probability comes to
 
05:25:19.910 --> 05:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
pass uh the the courts would love for
 
05:25:21.590 --> 05:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
everyone to have an attorney it only
 
05:25:23.110 --> 05:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
makes things more efficient and better
 
05:25:24.548 --> 05:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
in the courts there's there's no
 
05:25:26.788 --> 05:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
preference from the courts for anyone to
 
05:25:29.948 --> 05:25:29.958 align:start position:0%
ever foro attorney representation um and
 
05:25:32.990 --> 05:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
and we very much like everyone to have
 
05:25:35.070 --> 05:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
access to attorneys but unfortunately
 
05:25:36.670 --> 05:25:36.680 align:start position:0%
that's not what happens if you sit in a
 
05:25:39.150 --> 05:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
district court and and wait for people
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
who are waiting for their Conflict
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
attorneys because they can't be
 
05:25:43.030 --> 05:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
represented by the public defender they
 
05:25:45.150 --> 05:25:45.160 align:start position:0%
call the case not ready they call it the
 
05:25:46.750 --> 05:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
next week not ready they call it the
 
05:25:48.910 --> 05:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
next week not ready um people are
 
05:25:50.830 --> 05:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
waiting for justice in the state of New
 
05:25:52.270 --> 05:25:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because of our attorney
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
shortage but in a criminal case the only
 
05:25:56.948 --> 05:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
affected party is the defendant in abuse
 
05:25:58.310 --> 05:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
and neglect cases there are parents
 
05:25:59.708 --> 05:25:59.718 align:start position:0%
there are children there are multiple
 
05:26:01.310 --> 05:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
people who are affected SO waiting for
 
05:26:04.470 --> 05:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
the child's attorney delays the entire
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
case and universe of people and not only
 
05:26:08.270 --> 05:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
are there statutory deadlines that the
 
05:26:10.310 --> 05:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
legisl has given the courts to move
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
these cases along there are also Federal
 
05:26:14.430 --> 05:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
deadlines a oneyear deadline ask you a
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
theoretical question let's let's say um
 
05:26:21.310 --> 05:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
a year from now uh this bill is in place
 
05:26:24.030 --> 05:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
and a supply of lawyers has appeared in
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
order to meet the terms of this uh if
 
05:26:30.270 --> 05:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
the attorneys were available this
 
05:26:32.510 --> 05:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph would never be in effect is
 
05:26:34.430 --> 05:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
that true if an attorney is available
 
05:26:36.510 --> 05:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
all of this language is unneeded it's
 
05:26:37.948 --> 05:26:37.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's just extra language that
 
05:26:39.830 --> 05:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't get used it is only if we have a
 
05:26:41.628 --> 05:26:41.638 align:start position:0%
situation where an attorney is not
 
05:26:43.470 --> 05:26:43.480 align:start position:0%
available so so this is kind of like a
 
05:26:45.030 --> 05:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
break glass
 
05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
option we don't want to do this we don't
 
05:26:48.830 --> 05:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
want to break the glass but this gives
 
05:26:51.150 --> 05:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
us the ability to do it so we can keep
 
05:26:53.868 --> 05:26:53.878 align:start position:0%
cases moving through the system the
 
05:26:55.470 --> 05:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
courts very much want to comply with the
 
05:26:56.910 --> 05:26:56.920 align:start position:0%
legislator's desire to have attorneys
 
05:26:58.670 --> 05:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
for children we just may not be able to
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
find them is is there anyone in the
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
department that wants to speak to this
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to okay do you have a
 
05:27:08.708 --> 05:27:08.718 align:start position:0%
question yes I do Mr chairman uh
 
05:27:11.390 --> 05:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
if if the language of the bill passes
 
05:27:14.110 --> 05:27:14.120 align:start position:0%
versus this amendment if an attorney is
 
05:27:15.708 --> 05:27:15.718 align:start position:0%
not available does that mean that a
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
child would be staying with a
 
05:27:18.590 --> 05:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
potentially abusive parents instead of
 
05:27:19.990 --> 05:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
being placed in a
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
home I it should not um I I think what
 
05:27:25.270 --> 05:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
would practically happen I'm guessing if
 
05:27:27.868 --> 05:27:27.878 align:start position:0%
if if if this statute were simply silent
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
as to what to do if there's no attorney
 
05:27:31.150 --> 05:27:31.160 align:start position:0%
is that the case will go through 30 to
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
60 days of halted jilted uh difficult
 
05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
proceedings before eventually it has to
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
proceed anyway
 
05:27:40.350 --> 05:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
ahead and and where would the child be
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
during that time period I think that
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
they would probably be placed or they
 
05:27:45.830 --> 05:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to they have to be removed right
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
away from the abusive situation so it's
 
05:27:49.390 --> 05:27:49.400 align:start position:0%
either temporary or permanent placement
 
05:27:51.948 --> 05:27:51.958 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind um although I I I see
 
05:27:53.150 --> 05:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
the value and I know that The Advocates
 
05:27:54.270 --> 05:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
certainly see the value of having an
 
05:27:55.788 --> 05:27:55.798 align:start position:0%
attorney that these children are
 
05:27:57.470 --> 05:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
represented by Guardians dead Lim for
 
05:27:59.470 --> 05:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
their best interests the addition of the
 
05:28:01.110 --> 05:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
attorney is for their expressed
 
05:28:02.470 --> 05:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
interests when they want something
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
different than the guardian ID item has
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
determined is in their best interest so
 
05:28:09.230 --> 05:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
so the term uh justice Deni or delayed
 
05:28:11.670 --> 05:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
as Justice denied is jumping around in
 
05:28:14.270 --> 05:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
my head and this sounds like okay the
 
05:28:17.750 --> 05:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
best case is this but we don't want to
 
05:28:21.150 --> 05:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
pay for it at the cost of delaying the
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
system the the legislature could
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
certainly say halt the case and do
 
05:28:26.750 --> 05:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
nothing until there is an attorney but
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
we will be in violation of other
 
05:28:30.230 --> 05:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
deadlines that you have said and that
 
05:28:31.628 --> 05:28:31.638 align:start position:0%
the federal government has set for these
 
05:28:33.750 --> 05:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
cases wer representative
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
wer I'm pretty sure I remember some of
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this that
 
05:28:40.510 --> 05:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
cause representative priest to volunteer
 
05:28:43.150 --> 05:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
to write the the amendment was a lot of
 
05:28:47.190 --> 05:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
people said this seems ridiculous 14 new
 
05:28:49.390 --> 05:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
child protective service workers am I
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
right that we heard that that was we
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
heard testimony why do we need so many
 
05:28:56.750 --> 05:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
of them added you know it's if it's 124
 
05:28:58.590 --> 05:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
children what what do we need these 14
 
05:29:01.190 --> 05:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Service workers and you
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
know maybe we do need the attorneys but
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
uh do we need five of them for 124
 
05:29:09.590 --> 05:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
children it so but especially that child
 
05:29:11.350 --> 05:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
protective service worker right pretty
 
05:29:13.470 --> 05:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we heard that was way in
 
05:29:15.628 --> 05:29:15.638 align:start position:0%
excess of what most of the people that
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
dealt with this thought were necessary
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for writing the amendment
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%

05:29:27.310 --> 05:29:27.320 align:start position:0%

05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%

05:29:44.910 --> 05:29:44.920 align:start position:0%

05:31:50.708 --> 05:31:50.718 align:start position:0%
blurb okay so I got priest and although
 
05:31:53.910 --> 05:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
we just voted unanimously for an otpa
 
05:31:55.910 --> 05:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone think that there's a re
 
05:31:58.150 --> 05:31:58.160 align:start position:0%
reason for a Minority Report to talk
 
05:31:59.910 --> 05:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
about the amendment and the opposition
 
05:32:02.190 --> 05:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:32:02.200 --> 05:32:04.750 align:start position:0%
to the
amendment

05:32:04.750 --> 05:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:32:08.830 --> 05:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
no all right just asking
 
05:32:10.910 --> 05:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
if if you got you got days to think
 
05:32:15.510 --> 05:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
about it um all right all
 
05:32:19.230 --> 05:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
right so be because if there's going to
 
05:32:22.430 --> 05:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
be opposition on the floor then it would
 
05:32:24.990 --> 05:32:25.000 align:start position:0%
be good to have the house calendar with
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
the report to explain the basis of the
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
argument that that's all I'm thinking
 
05:32:32.230 --> 05:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
but you're it's up to you on what how
 
05:32:33.510 --> 05:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
you want to handle
 
05:32:35.910 --> 05:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
that go
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
ahead Mike though
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
we don't know that we won't get some
 
05:32:41.400 --> 05:32:42.670 align:start position:0%
we don't know that we won't get some
opposition

05:32:42.670 --> 05:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
from um the other committee that
 
05:32:50.430 --> 05:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
had a similar amendment that turned it
 
05:32:55.548 --> 05:32:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
also would it be possible but they don't
 
05:32:59.230 --> 05:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
get to write they don't get to write the
 
05:33:01.150 --> 05:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
blur that's what I'm saying no they
 
05:33:03.430 --> 05:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
don't get to write the blur right true
 
05:33:05.110 --> 05:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
but they do get to speak on the floor if
 
05:33:08.270 --> 05:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
they want oh sure okay sure um would it
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
be possible to take like a 10minute
 
05:33:14.750 --> 05:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
break just yeah we can take a a a recess
 
05:33:17.670 --> 05:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes and uh there's only two
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
bills left and the way I look at these
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
two bills it really ought not take a
 
05:33:27.190 --> 05:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
long time yeah I I need about 10 or 15
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%

itl set out can I have two seconds I
 
05:41:49.590 --> 05:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
apologize no that's all right uh and
 
05:41:51.788 --> 05:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
then so we have a motion on the floor
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
itl of 567 and is there discussion do
 
05:41:58.030 --> 05:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
you need a moment to be prepared to
 
05:42:02.390 --> 05:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.910 --> 05:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.430 --> 05:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
I had my brain in the other room on
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
another bill so I just needed to get my
 
05:42:11.080 --> 05:42:12.910 align:start position:0%
another bill so I just needed to get my
head

05:42:12.910 --> 05:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
head
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
together it's all
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
right I I want your brain engaged
 
05:42:19.708 --> 05:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
representative walner uh do you have
 
05:42:22.548 --> 05:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
remarks or discussion just you know
 
05:42:26.150 --> 05:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
briefly I think that there's value in um
 
05:42:28.390 --> 05:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
a doing a report like this and I think
 
05:42:29.670 --> 05:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
05:42:31.628 --> 05:42:31.638 align:start position:0%
probably I mean I don't think the
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
department really
 
05:42:35.670 --> 05:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
felt equipped to do it they didn't seem
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
there didn't seem to be any
 
05:42:40.350 --> 05:42:40.360 align:start position:0%
Interest really in moving forward with
 
05:42:42.350 --> 05:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
them doing it but I do think there might
 
05:42:42.360 --> 05:42:43.670 align:start position:0%
them doing it but I do think there might
be

05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
contract organizations out there that
 
05:42:48.830 --> 05:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
they could contract with to um to have
 
05:42:52.030 --> 05:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
it done and um you know it seems like
 
05:42:55.708 --> 05:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
there would be be value in that may I
 
05:42:58.510 --> 05:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
tell you my rationale on why I'm
 
05:42:59.830 --> 05:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable with an
 
05:43:03.670 --> 05:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
itl uh one it seems like it's new work
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
to the department by new work I mean
 
05:43:08.510 --> 05:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a new function it's a new
 
05:43:11.070 --> 05:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
role it's a new way of B doing business
 
05:43:13.150 --> 05:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
and and and there would be a learning
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
curve if we wanted to expand the scope
 
05:43:16.910 --> 05:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
of work of the
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
department um also as I understand it um
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
the these two drugs were uh reviewed in
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
courts in the Texas court and an appell
 
05:43:29.468 --> 05:43:29.478 align:start position:0%
at court and there's now a decision a
 
05:43:31.350 --> 05:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
decision in front of the Supreme
 
05:43:34.468 --> 05:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
Court the Texas Court federal court
 
05:43:36.750 --> 05:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
determined that the FDA in approving
 
05:43:36.760 --> 05:43:37.750 align:start position:0%
determined that the FDA in approving
these

05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:43:42.788 --> 05:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
Two drugs did not um meet their
 
05:43:46.230 --> 05:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
standards of of FDA approval for safety
 
05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
and efficacy that they they uh
 
05:43:51.948 --> 05:43:51.958 align:start position:0%
apparently I I'm this is not the legal
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
term but they may have sh taken some
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
shortcuts to get an approval before it
 
05:44:02.110 --> 05:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
was cooked and Texas put in place an
 
05:44:04.910 --> 05:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
injunction because of that the appell at
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
court did not dispute that the FDA had
 
05:44:14.510 --> 05:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
um shortcut the the process for safety
 
05:44:16.910 --> 05:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
and efficacy but they did dispute
 
05:44:18.548 --> 05:44:18.558 align:start position:0%
whether or not an injunction was
 
05:44:20.948 --> 05:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
appropriate so I think the decision in
 
05:44:23.628 --> 05:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is whether or not the
 
05:44:27.708 --> 05:44:27.718 align:start position:0%
injunction was correct but but the the
 
05:44:31.150 --> 05:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
fact finding a fact was that FDA didn't
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
do their normal safety and
 
05:44:37.190 --> 05:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
efficacy and so um and and there's 's
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
also this issue of these the companies I
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
don't even know who makes these two
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
drugs it could be two companies or could
 
05:44:47.548 --> 05:44:47.558 align:start position:0%
be multiple companies but um but those
 
05:44:49.990 --> 05:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
are those are billion dooll corporations
 
05:44:52.030 --> 05:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
billion dollar corporations have huge
 
05:44:54.270 --> 05:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
marketing departments I don't I don't I
 
05:44:55.628 --> 05:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
don't know that we should be in the
 
05:44:59.110 --> 05:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
business of you know facilitating a
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
marketing budget so for those Reasons
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with an
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
itto any other comments
 
05:45:10.310 --> 05:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
yes I'll just say that I'll be voting
 
05:45:12.590 --> 05:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
against the itl um
 
05:45:15.750 --> 05:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
I we discussed a little bit on Tuesday
 
05:45:19.750 --> 05:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
about um these drugs have been used for
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
a number of years um effectively to um
 
05:45:29.070 --> 05:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
also assist when women um have a
 
05:45:32.350 --> 05:45:32.360 align:start position:0%
miscarriage or a pregnancy um
 
05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly terminates and um they have
 
05:45:37.750 --> 05:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
been proven to be very effective
 
05:45:40.070 --> 05:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure that we have all
 
05:45:43.468 --> 05:45:43.478 align:start position:0%
the information needed um to ensure that
 
05:45:45.788 --> 05:45:45.798 align:start position:0%
these drugs are available uh when women
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
need them that's it thank you if the
 
05:45:52.230 --> 05:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
department the FDA had gone through the
 
05:45:55.750 --> 05:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
standard safety and efficacy clinical
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
trials protocols and they had determined
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
appropriately that it was effective I
 
05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
would agree with you but but they didn't
 
05:46:10.430 --> 05:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and so so having the state pushing
 
05:46:13.110 --> 05:46:13.120 align:start position:0%
for any drug I don't I don't I'm not
 
05:46:14.548 --> 05:46:14.558 align:start position:0%
talking about the purpose of the drug
 
05:46:17.190 --> 05:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying you know the safety and
 
05:46:20.230 --> 05:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
efficacy are important functions of the
 
05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
FDA and it isn't that if we if I mean
 
05:46:26.628 --> 05:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers can still
 
05:46:28.628 --> 05:46:28.638 align:start position:0%
prescribe these these things are still
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
these pills are still
 
05:46:34.310 --> 05:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
available uh we're not inhibiting the
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care System we're just not trying
 
05:46:37.990 --> 05:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
to get in between the health care
 
05:46:40.708 --> 05:46:40.718 align:start position:0%
provider and the patient the health care
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
Fe profession and Physicians are you
 
05:46:45.510 --> 05:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
know can make their own determination
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
what's in the patient's best interest I
 
05:46:49.590 --> 05:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to weigh in on that
 
05:46:53.628 --> 05:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
that so so we just disagree but that
 
05:46:57.708 --> 05:46:57.718 align:start position:0%
that may be the first uh okay
 
05:47:00.910 --> 05:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
so is there more
 
05:47:03.948 --> 05:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
discussion if you're ready for a vote
 
05:47:07.548 --> 05:47:07.558 align:start position:0%

again that was a Mooney and Earth and um
 
05:48:00.510 --> 05:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
you want to handle the jacket so I'll
 
05:48:02.230 --> 05:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'll go ahead and write the blurb on
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
that um you know I think people are
 
05:48:07.750 --> 05:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
tired of punching me so I can write
 
05:48:12.590 --> 05:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
that uh okay so uh let's move on to S SP
 
05:48:15.110 --> 05:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
596 relative to the definition of
 
05:48:17.070 --> 05:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
disability or special needs under the
 
05:48:20.670 --> 05:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
child care scholarship program my note
 
05:48:23.548 --> 05:48:23.558 align:start position:0%
on this says that representative walner
 
05:48:26.350 --> 05:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
will work on a new fiscal
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
note did you did you do that I did okay
 
05:48:32.750 --> 05:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about that and maybe
 
05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
refresh us on what the uh bill is trying
 
05:48:38.070 --> 05:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
to do I think Kevin has a I have an
 
05:48:51.310 --> 05:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.990 --> 05:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay so we're trying to finish by four
 
05:48:55.750 --> 05:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
because we lose representative string
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk fast
 
05:49:00.990 --> 05:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
okay and then you still want to talk
 
05:49:04.468 --> 05:49:04.478 align:start position:0%
about 499 in a a brief intro just brief
 
05:49:07.468 --> 05:49:07.478 align:start position:0%
yes okay um
 
05:49:11.110 --> 05:49:11.120 align:start position:0%
if you remember this is the bill where
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
children with
 
05:49:15.590 --> 05:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
um special
 
05:49:20.350 --> 05:49:20.360 align:start position:0%
needs are in child care and child care
 
05:49:23.030 --> 05:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
providers may need to
 
05:49:25.590 --> 05:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
provide special things for those kids
 
05:49:27.190 --> 05:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
they may
 
05:49:30.430 --> 05:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
need a little bit of oneon-one
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
attention from the provider every day
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
meaning that the provider has to
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
increase their Staffing slice
 
05:49:39.548 --> 05:49:39.558 align:start position:0%
they may need they may need some special
 
05:49:40.708 --> 05:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:49:44.868 --> 05:49:44.878 align:start position:0%
equipment um they may need some extra
 
05:49:47.670 --> 05:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
hands when they go out for a walk they
 
05:49:50.750 --> 05:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
may need extra hands if they go on a
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
field trip in the bus um you know just
 
05:49:57.548 --> 05:49:57.558 align:start position:0%
any number of things that you might need
 
05:50:00.590 --> 05:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
if you had a child
 
05:50:04.590 --> 05:50:04.600 align:start position:0%
who came to you who had some special
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
needs often these often these are are
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
kids who maybe have some difficulties in
 
05:50:11.910 --> 05:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
the group they may have some behavioral
 
05:50:14.990 --> 05:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
problems um it might be nice to have an
 
05:50:17.110 --> 05:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
extra person sit with them at Circle
 
05:50:18.910 --> 05:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
time so that they aren't touching
 
05:50:22.190 --> 05:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
everybody or you know interrupting and
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
and just providing that extra help that
 
05:50:28.548 --> 05:50:28.558 align:start position:0%
those kids need early when they're
 
05:50:30.430 --> 05:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
little I mean we're talking little we're
 
05:50:34.990 --> 05:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
talking kids who are two years old um
 
05:50:37.990 --> 05:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
and helping them adjust into the child
 
05:50:40.310 --> 05:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
care setting and hopefully if they can
 
05:50:43.628 --> 05:50:43.638 align:start position:0%
do that in those early preschool
 
05:50:46.150 --> 05:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
years that'll help them get ready for
 
05:50:49.868 --> 05:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
school and they won't need as much
 
05:50:52.910 --> 05:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
special help in public school which we
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
know becomes very expensive so this is
 
05:50:58.190 --> 05:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
really PR kind of preventative the
 
05:51:01.150 --> 05:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
05:51:04.990 --> 05:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
already has a program like this there
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
are already some children in
 
05:51:12.468 --> 05:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
it um it takes a certain level of
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
professional to make the decision as to
 
05:51:16.510 --> 05:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're the children are going
 
05:51:19.230 --> 05:51:19.240 align:start position:0%
to be classified to get this special
 
05:51:21.868 --> 05:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
differential rate
 
05:51:25.788 --> 05:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
um what this does is allowed for a
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
developmental screening tool to be used
 
05:51:31.150 --> 05:51:31.160 align:start position:0%
and I brought one with me so you can see
 
05:51:34.030 --> 05:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
it the one that I'm familiar with mostly
 
05:51:37.670 --> 05:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
is ages and stages and it's a checklist
 
05:51:40.590 --> 05:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
that um and most of them work like this
 
05:51:43.190 --> 05:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's a checklist that both the teacher
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
in the trial care center and the parent
 
05:51:50.230 --> 05:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
do each of them do it and then uh look
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
at what those how that turns out some
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
children there are no issues some
 
05:51:59.510 --> 05:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
children might need a little help um to
 
05:52:01.510 --> 05:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
be able to to stay in their childcare
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
setting so and what the amendment does
 
05:52:05.600 --> 05:52:10.510 align:start position:0%
setting so and what the amendment does
is

05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:12.868 --> 05:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
basically say that the department may
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
use federal funds for
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
available so if they have federal funds
 
05:52:19.750 --> 05:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
that are available for this um and like
 
05:52:22.830 --> 05:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
I said there's already a program like
 
05:52:28.150 --> 05:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
this that exist at the department um and
 
05:52:30.708 --> 05:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
to use General funds from within the
 
05:52:32.750 --> 05:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
Department's existing budget we're
 
05:52:35.670 --> 05:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
talking about this being a very small
 
05:52:38.190 --> 05:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
number of children in a very small
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
allocation I think the bill came to us
 
05:52:46.708 --> 05:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
with like an estimate of 375,000 a year
 
05:52:50.270 --> 05:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
and I really think it'll be much less
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
than that right now I think they're only
 
05:52:56.868 --> 05:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
monthly they're only spending on the
 
05:52:59.510 --> 05:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
children that are in the program now
 
05:53:04.430 --> 05:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
they're only spending between 50 and
 
05:53:07.590 --> 05:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
$60,000 a month
 
05:53:09.510 --> 05:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
comment I'm ready for
 
05:53:12.350 --> 05:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
comment okay
 
05:53:16.548 --> 05:53:16.558 align:start position:0%
um I I I I hear you say that this will
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
affect a relatively few number of kids
 
05:53:22.468 --> 05:53:22.478 align:start position:0%
and I think the quantification of how
 
05:53:25.430 --> 05:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
big a population that may be would be
 
05:53:28.350 --> 05:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
dependent upon what assessment tool was
 
05:53:30.590 --> 05:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
selected and you brought an assessment
 
05:53:32.030 --> 05:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
tool but I don't think we're going to be
 
05:53:35.868 --> 05:53:35.878 align:start position:0%
able to read it in three minutes so so
 
05:53:38.510 --> 05:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so given that we're we're modifying
 
05:53:40.788 --> 05:53:40.798 align:start position:0%
the definition and and by that we're
 
05:53:44.070 --> 05:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
probably expanding the pool of eligible
 
05:53:49.030 --> 05:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
kids uh uh I I I don't know that we have
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
enough information to really figure out
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
what the impact is on the population
 
05:53:54.638 --> 05:53:56.310 align:start position:0%
what the impact is on the population
being

05:53:56.310 --> 05:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:54:00.110 --> 05:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
served uh and and the fact that we're
 
05:54:04.110 --> 05:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
not there is no code a formal diagnostic
 
05:54:06.788 --> 05:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
or formal special education code to
 
05:54:08.628 --> 05:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
capture this
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
category it feels to me it just feels to
 
05:54:13.868 --> 05:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
me this is a reaction not an analysis
 
05:54:17.788 --> 05:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
but it just feels to me like
 
05:54:20.670 --> 05:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a little variable and subject to
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
interpretation the way it is now on who
 
05:54:26.190 --> 05:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
would be eligible and and and I I I
 
05:54:28.030 --> 05:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
would rather see
 
05:54:31.708 --> 05:54:31.718 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill along with your Amendment
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
taken to interim study that would be my
 
05:54:37.788 --> 05:54:37.798 align:start position:0%
preference but but out of deference to
 
05:54:40.750 --> 05:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
you because we're short on time and I
 
05:54:44.190 --> 05:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to for force you into a vote
 
05:54:46.190 --> 05:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
here when it's
 
05:54:49.030 --> 05:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
premature can you or would you be
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
willing to have us recess this until
 
05:54:51.638 --> 05:54:52.830 align:start position:0%
willing to have us recess this until
Tuesday

05:54:52.830 --> 05:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
morning so that we can take a look at
 
05:54:57.070 --> 05:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
the assessment tool because I would need
 
05:55:00.190 --> 05:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
to talk to my folks
 
05:55:03.430 --> 05:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the impact of that assessment tool
 
05:55:04.590 --> 05:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
in terms
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
of whether or not
 
05:55:08.750 --> 05:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
it it you know what it's going to do to
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
the size of the uh serve
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
population so how would you like to
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
proceed okay I I
 
05:55:18.350 --> 05:55:18.360 align:start position:0%
am I am only bringing one assessment
 
05:55:21.310 --> 05:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
tool there are many out there that the
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
department would I I believe the way the
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill is at this point is that the
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
department would U make the decision as
 
05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
to what kinds of assessment tool they
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
would accept so I'm only bring I'm not
 
05:55:36.948 --> 05:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting this is
 
05:55:40.110 --> 05:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
the end all and be all this is just one
 
05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm familiar with that I brought
 
05:55:43.628 --> 05:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
forward so you could see it right
 
05:55:44.910 --> 05:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
because I knew that was a question
 
05:55:49.350 --> 05:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
people had um I will tell you because I
 
05:55:51.190 --> 05:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
checked with some people this morning
 
05:55:54.030 --> 05:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
before I came that
 
05:55:59.110 --> 05:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
um there is a before any provider can
 
05:56:01.390 --> 05:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
receive this kind of reimbursement
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly specific um
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
verification that the department has the
 
05:56:09.350 --> 05:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
provider go through and even um saying
 
05:56:12.190 --> 05:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
how they will use the extra funds to
 
05:56:14.750 --> 05:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
integrate this child into their into
 
05:56:17.990 --> 05:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
their program so what what would your
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
preference be would you like to make
 
05:56:22.270 --> 05:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
your motion and vote now or would you
 
05:56:24.230 --> 05:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
prefer to wait till Tuesday morning so
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
that we have time to talk to more people
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I I guess I'll take my chances
 
05:56:32.030 --> 05:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
and and come back on Tuesday because if
 
05:56:34.948 --> 05:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
we vote now I don't think I have the
 
05:56:38.350 --> 05:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
votes um at this this point but so maybe
 
05:56:42.030 --> 05:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong so with with your with with
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
your acquiescence uh not permission but
 
05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
agreement let's let's go ahead I want to
 
05:56:52.910 --> 05:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh recess s SP 496 to Tuesday Morning um
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
and where we can we can bring it back up
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
and um Miss Morris would would you would
 
05:57:01.468 --> 05:57:01.478 align:start position:0%
you find somebody to make me smart on
 
05:57:04.030 --> 05:57:04.040 align:start position:0%
the variability of the assessment tools
 
05:57:06.788 --> 05:57:06.798 align:start position:0%
and what what the assessment tools may
 
05:57:09.670 --> 05:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
do to increase the
 
05:57:12.310 --> 05:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
population uh that would be served can
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
you are you able to do that by Wednesday
 
05:57:17.830 --> 05:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
night or Monday night
 
05:57:23.990 --> 05:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
rather okay all right so um all right so
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to recess on
 
05:57:28.910 --> 05:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
4117 till Tuesday morning we're going to
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
recess on SB 596 until Tuesday Morning
 
05:57:36.990 --> 05:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
um I think we're going to schedule that
 
05:57:39.910 --> 05:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
at 10:00 a.m. that that'll give us two
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
hours I I don't mean to repow a lot of
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
the ground on 47 I just wanted us to be
 
05:57:48.270 --> 05:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
prepared to know what we think yes sir
 
05:57:51.788 --> 05:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
so clarification uh 10:00 on Wednesday
 
05:57:55.350 --> 05:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
yes no no no no Tuesday Monday Tuesday
 
05:57:58.030 --> 05:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
Monday okay so so so just just to
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
explain what's going on right full
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
Finance has so many things in division
 
05:58:05.670 --> 05:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
one that there that's Monday afternoon
 
05:58:07.830 --> 05:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
division three is
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
Tuesday for our bills so we have to be
 
05:58:12.868 --> 05:58:12.878 align:start position:0%
finished you know before noon or
 
05:58:15.948 --> 05:58:15.958 align:start position:0%
whatever so to to to hand off to
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
division uh the full finance committee
 
05:58:20.430 --> 05:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
all the division three bills okay and
 
05:58:23.548 --> 05:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
for Republicans Tu Monday morning at
 
05:58:29.670 --> 05:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
noon like to have a box okay so so let's
 
05:58:31.990 --> 05:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
I I know I know you're eager to go uh
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
can you can you do us a flyby on what
 
05:58:39.830 --> 05:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
well representative
 
05:58:45.788 --> 05:58:45.798 align:start position:0%
Tori has an amendment that um basically
 
05:58:48.750 --> 05:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
adds back in the
 
05:58:54.190 --> 05:58:54.200 align:start position:0%
B EBT I'm sorry i s Su EBT the summer
 
05:58:58.990 --> 05:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
EBT and um it adds it back in for um
 
05:59:02.548 --> 05:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
just as it came to us from the Senate so
 
05:59:05.070 --> 05:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
um that that's what we're thinking I
 
05:59:07.150 --> 05:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
know there is been some other work done
 
05:59:09.910 --> 05:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
by the department on uh a couple of
 
05:59:12.468 --> 05:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
other amendments which I have to look I
 
05:59:14.270 --> 05:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
really have to have a few minutes to
 
05:59:17.548 --> 05:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
really look at those closer but we're
 
05:59:20.990 --> 05:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of at adding to the
 
05:59:24.830 --> 05:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
elderly part that you've already passed
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
adding to that of the summer EBT for
 
05:59:31.708 --> 05:59:31.718 align:start position:0%
children starting in the summer of 24
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
represent tki I sense you want to say
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
something no I just want to clarify what
 
05:59:40.110 --> 05:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
the intention is so this division passed
 
05:59:42.270 --> 05:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
um an amendment with your name on it I
 
05:59:44.548 --> 05:59:44.558 align:start position:0%
think yes that was
 
05:59:48.590 --> 05:59:48.600 align:start position:0%
just um the elderly application right I
 
05:59:51.868 --> 05:59:51.878 align:start position:0%
have a different amendment that H
 
05:59:55.190 --> 05:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
includes your Amendment but adds summer
 
05:59:59.270 --> 05:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
EBT so my conclusion would be that
 
06:00:03.350 --> 06:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
um this my Amendment would be in place
 
06:00:05.468 --> 06:00:05.478 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that this division
 
06:00:07.310 --> 06:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
already saw
 
06:00:09.788 --> 06:00:09.798 align:start position:0%
okay so because we didn't have this on
 
06:00:12.590 --> 06:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
today's House calendar I don't really
 
06:00:15.390 --> 06:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
think we should talk about it much more
 
06:00:18.948 --> 06:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
um and so my thought on this we have we
 
06:00:21.230 --> 06:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
could have two thoughts that you could
 
06:00:23.310 --> 06:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
bring your argument to the full finance
 
06:00:27.230 --> 06:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
committee on Tuesday afternoon or I
 
06:00:30.468 --> 06:00:30.478 align:start position:0%
could add it to this the schedule for
 
06:00:32.190 --> 06:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning that would give us three
 
06:00:36.030 --> 06:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
things to do in two hours
 
06:00:37.788 --> 06:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
I won't as I stated earlier I won't be
 
06:00:39.590 --> 06:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
here Tuesday morning but I entrust my
 
06:00:41.910 --> 06:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
division members to properly um
 
06:00:44.190 --> 06:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
communicate what I want to do with it so
 
06:00:46.430 --> 06:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
would you prefer that we do talk about
 
06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
it Tuesday Morning in division or do you
 
06:00:52.468 --> 06:00:52.478 align:start position:0%
want to just go for it in full Finance
 
06:00:54.750 --> 06:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
what's your what's your preference I'd
 
06:00:57.468 --> 06:00:57.478 align:start position:0%
like to know if if this division would
 
06:01:00.230 --> 06:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
be open to that discussion but we're not
 
06:01:02.628 --> 06:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
discussing it now so I I think we're
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
open to discussing it we have a history
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
of bringing back prev previous committee
 
06:01:09.030 --> 06:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
votes for reconsideration and I I think
 
06:01:10.590 --> 06:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with the the
 
06:01:14.030 --> 06:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee's precedent so I I'm I'm okay
 
06:01:16.150 --> 06:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
bring it back if you're open to
 
06:01:19.070 --> 06:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussing it Tuesday uh starting at
 
06:01:21.708 --> 06:01:21.718 align:start position:0%
10:00 a.m. then I trust my my colleagues
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
here to defend my
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment okay and again I don't want to
 
06:01:28.110 --> 06:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
have us discuss it now because it's not
 
06:01:32.590 --> 06:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
on the house calendar okay
 
06:01:36.548 --> 06:01:36.558 align:start position:0%
say I I I'm going to ask or do you know
 
06:01:38.788 --> 06:01:38.798 align:start position:0%
can we can we get these three bills for
 
06:01:42.390 --> 06:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning uh not in the calendar
 
06:01:43.990 --> 06:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
but you can get them publicly noticed
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
sure I I want them noticed properly not
 
06:01:48.708 --> 06:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
in the house calendar announce the
 
06:01:50.948 --> 06:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
recess make sure that there's a notice
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:58.270 --> 06:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
door not yeah 499 is not part of the
 
06:02:00.628 --> 06:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
recess because we're not talking about
 
06:02:03.910 --> 06:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
it so thought we were finished we we are
 
06:02:06.708 --> 06:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
but but there's there's a request to
 
06:02:09.628 --> 06:02:09.638 align:start position:0%
reconsider $499 and we've done this
 
06:02:12.670 --> 06:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
before so I I also think this being a
 
06:02:14.190 --> 06:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
this being a division and not the full
 
06:02:16.948 --> 06:02:16.958 align:start position:0%
committee you could informally decide to
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh reconsider a previous vote and it
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a big deal would would would
 
06:02:23.270 --> 06:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
it still be preferable to try to get an
 
06:02:26.830 --> 06:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
online notice to notice it properly
 
06:02:30.270 --> 06:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
sure do that I
 
06:02:32.830 --> 06:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
I yeah we could put it on the door I
 
06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't know yeah at a minimum it would go
 
06:02:37.708 --> 06:02:37.718 align:start position:0%
on the door okay well whatever the
 
06:02:39.948 --> 06:02:39.958 align:start position:0%
minimal standards are I want to meet or
 
06:02:39.958 --> 06:02:41.190 align:start position:0%
minimal standards are I want to meet or
exceed

06:02:41.190 --> 06:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
exceed
 
06:02:43.910 --> 06:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
those representative Mooney thank you is
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
there any idea what the fiscal note any
 
06:02:50.150 --> 06:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
idea would be on this discussed
 
06:02:53.110 --> 06:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment just
 
06:02:56.430 --> 06:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
now uh for $499 it would be the HHS
 
06:02:58.750 --> 06:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
piece was a little under 1.2 million in
 
06:03:00.708 --> 06:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
total so the summary BT program was
 
06:03:04.030 --> 06:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
about 1.1 million in fiscal
 
06:03:07.788 --> 06:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
25 thank you and and does a fiscal note
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%

06:03:12.830 --> 06:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
million of federal
 
06:03:15.628 --> 06:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
money it doesn't no
 
06:03:19.948 --> 06:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh did we leave anything
 
06:03:23.270 --> 06:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
out that we should do Mr Ripple okay so
 
06:03:25.830 --> 06:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
I'll take a motion to
 
06:03:30.990 --> 06:03:31.000 align:start position:0%
adjourn second okay um no no discussion
 
06:03:35.510 --> 06:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
so we are in recess just in case that's
 
06:03:38.990 --> 06:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
the proper term until Tuesday Tuesday
