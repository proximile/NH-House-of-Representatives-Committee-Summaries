noticed that uh after we amended it
 
00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
there was a revised fiscal note but the
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
ones sitting out here don't have that um
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the committee has but
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
the uh uh the revenue reduction is
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
dramatically less after the amendment um
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
you know that the house made recently it
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%

it on the top it's uh amended 229 from
the

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
note I don't I don't know if we have
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
here it is I printed it from the State
 
00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:12.910 align:start position:0%
here it is I printed it from the State
website

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday representative use your
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
microphone please they might have
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
changed changed the amendment number
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
when they put it into the calendar the
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
amendment had a person's name on it they
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
put it for the the diff the difference
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal note has different numbers
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
in it the one that I have versus what's
 
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.240 align:start position:0%
sitting on the table out here just I
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know which one you folks were
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
looking at oh
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
dear I have one that that says
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
22924 okay and the number for 2024 in
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue reduction is
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
23825 to zero but if so that's the new
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
one okay thank you I just want to make
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
sure okay so um this bill as amended
 
00:13:58.949 --> 00:13:58.959 align:start position:0%
does a number of things it uh it makes
 
00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
various uh changes kind of uh followup
 
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
on some things that were missed in uh
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the changes for occupational
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
licensing last year but the change that
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
has a fiscal impact is removal of the
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
licensing of of the registration of
 
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
licensing of of the registration of
medical

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
technicians and committee did that
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
because that whole thing is basically
 
00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:23.759 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional I mean director Courtney
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
can give you more details if you like
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
but um nobody was interest wasn't
 
00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
serving on the board the board never met
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
as a result they couldn't create any
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
rules I mean there it was completely
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't function at all and um and so
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
it's being eliminated and as a result
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
according to the fiscal note they're
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
going to uh you know not take in the uh
 
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.389 align:start position:0%
going to uh you know not take in the uh
registration

00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
registration
 
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240 align:start position:0%
fees and um there'll be some minor
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
reduction work but it says it's not
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
going to reduce costs but uh if you have
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
questions about the details of why we
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
did it or you know that aspect of the
 
00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
bill I'll be glad to answer it but uh
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
just to get further clarification on the
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
on the number if we look at the last
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
page you were saying the medical
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
technicians number of
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
23825 excuse me um on the last page of
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah where at the bottom the
 
00:15:19.949 --> 00:15:19.959 align:start position:0%
where it says Revenue in the the in the
 
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
table um for FY 2024 it says 23825 to
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
zero depending on when the Bill's
 
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.470 align:start position:0%
zero depending on when the Bill's
passed

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
passed
 
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.309 align:start position:0%
passed
the

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
last the last page of the I mean it's
 
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal I can bring this up if you want
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
help this is the new one yours yeah I I
 
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
think the the difficulty here is that
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
we're some of us have one fiscal Noe and
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
others have the other F I mean the new
 
00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
one the numbers are around I think a
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
tenth as much or something go mine which
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
came off off also out
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
of mine which came out of uh two nights
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
ago I think it was the um
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
internet on is labeled LBA 24
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
22924 yours was the original fiscal note
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
the the what I'm looking at is something
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
that was on our desk this
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
morning right and I noticed the ones
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
that are set out today here on the table
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
are the old one oh they are they have
 
00:16:41.829 --> 00:16:41.839 align:start position:0%
the old fiscal note yeah okay yeah she
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
she missed that it had been
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
changed so you you have the only copy of
 
00:16:49.949 --> 00:16:49.959 align:start position:0%
the new fiscal note then yeah I just
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
brought one for myself okay all right
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
we'll have to a
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
copy you have a copy of you have a copy
 
00:17:05.549 --> 00:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
second that's because I went to the
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
internet to download all these bills
 
00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.669 align:start position:0%
 
them

00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
and if you could uh just um tell us
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
briefly again why the huge decrease
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
there okay the original Bill eliminated
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
the licensing of uh of uh lnas licensed
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
nursing assistants because they uh
 
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799 align:start position:0%
there's also a federal registration
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
program and the thought was that they
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
could just be in that program and not
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
require a separate license I mean we
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
need more of them they're not paid a lot
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
and we want to reduce the cost and the
 
00:17:58.549 --> 00:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
trouble to them but it turned out there
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
was a problem
 
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
um the issue what we couldn't get rid of
 
00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
that one at least at that time because
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
um the growing number of them are are
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
hired by families to work in people's
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
homes and if we just had the federal
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
legislation under the rules for that we
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
could not require a background check um
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
and that you know was felt that that
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
could be a problem um I speaking with
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
director Courtney there may be a way
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
around it that can actually be done
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
without legislation but you can ask her
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
about that I don't have the details and
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the other one was um it it got rid of
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
the licensing for um Medical Imaging um
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
technicians and there's a lot more of
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
those in the lnas than there are of the
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
the regular medical technicians which
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
remained in the bill and so the number
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
of Li of people being
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
licensed um that would be removed
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
reduced was a much smaller number than
 
00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
the original bill which is why the
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
Ellery I'll get the question out early
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
so that the commissioner can respond
 
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
when she gets up here um will the agency
 
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
opl or damn initials um have the ability
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
to continue to function effectively with
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
reduced pay
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
in um you you can I I'm not the one to
 
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
why that's why I asked you so somebody
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.789 align:start position:0%
okay representative
elme

00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:37.799 align:start position:0%
elme
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh I don't know if this is proper
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
here but are we going to do anything
 
00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:46.990 align:start position:0%
here but are we going to do anything
about

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
MedEx um which are the people that that
 
00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
guy that poisoned yeah I'm familiar with
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
yeah there was a problem with hepatitis
 
00:19:59.070 --> 00:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
C if I recall correctly yeah um
 
00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't know what is going to be done
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
in the future um this isn't working U
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you know in the future some other
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
way of handling it can be found but they
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
all work in medical facilities that or
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
the medical facilities are licensed I
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
believe or at least you know they have
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
an employer who should be overseeing
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
what's going on they're not out uh
 
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
practicing on their
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
own but um you know there wasn't a a
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
solution that might work that was
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
suggested um while we were dealing with
 
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.149 align:start position:0%
suggested um while we were dealing with
the

00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
you anybody yes representative elberger
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm trying to figure
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
out how to phrase some of
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
this assuming that this uh
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
board the the board that deals with the
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
licensed medical technicians is no
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
longer looking at people in that
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
profession what kind of education or
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
other requirements or skills will be
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
examined and by whom to make sure that
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
those folks are
 
00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:17.559 align:start position:0%
actually competent to do the work that
 
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're being asked to do I understand
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
um first of all it's registration for
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
them not licens that's fine and second
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
of all because U they could never get
 
00:21:27.549 --> 00:21:27.559 align:start position:0%
more than one person to serve on the
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
board the never had a quum it couldn't
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
meet it couldn't create rules so it
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
never had any requirements at all uh but
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
what you know existed before and has
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
been going on and would continue is that
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
you know their employer which is a
 
00:21:42.669 --> 00:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
medical facility would have some
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for if they're going to
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
hire them um but medical technician is I
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
mean they're
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
not it's a wide range of Things director
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
Courtney might be able to give you a
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
better idea but it's basically anybody
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
who has access to patients and might
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
have access to drugs not that they could
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be handling them but they
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
might be in the same room with them and
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
that includes people that like clean the
 
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
O and clean the ER and it's a range of
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
things so there's not going to be one
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
set of
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
training uh for them at least that's my
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
understanding Mr
 
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um followup followup so in what
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that the responsibility
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
for making sure that the people who are
 
00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:27.039 align:start position:0%
hired in these roles are competent and
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
safe and all of that will be the people
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
who hire them not some Outside Agency
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
correct that's my understanding yeah
 
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and again director Courtney
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
details anybody else seeing none thank
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
you let's the updated FAL not okay next
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh the next pin card I have is uh
 
00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:01.149 align:start position:0%
uh the next pin card I have is uh
um

00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh L I'm having trouble reading it Lind
 
00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.230 align:start position:0%
uh L I'm having trouble reading it Lind
Lindsay

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
Lindsay
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
name uh thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
the committee I am Lindsay Cy I'm the
 
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
executive director of The Office of
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
professional license insurance
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
certification um we are not uh taking a
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but I'm here to
 
00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:27.559 align:start position:0%
offer and answer any questions that you
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
may have regarding specifically the
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
financial impact but as well as the
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
policy underpinings of this bill um in
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh whether we can absorb the
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
decrease in Revenue I would say yes um
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
this historically this registration was
 
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
created back in
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
2015 it's not an actual profession um as
 
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative lakas mentioned it's just
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
anybody who is not licensed who may come
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
into contact with controlled drugs and
 
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.789 align:start position:0%
into contact with controlled drugs and
paat

00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
paat
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
and so it's somewhat vague somewhat
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to Define um and as a result
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
of that uh people don't feel like they
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
want to participate in the board this
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
has been our understanding um because
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a profession that has specific
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
requirements specific training um it's
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
just anybody who may come into contact
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
with drugs so they have not had a quorum
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
in over two years have not had a meeting
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
in over two years um and the decision
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
was made um to essentially repeal the
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
registration requirement
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
because they have not had meetings there
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
has not been a lot of Staff support and
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
because it's a strict registration there
 
00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
has not been a lot of Staff support the
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
fee that was charged was previously
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
required by Statute so there was no
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to modify that fee um and so
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
what I would say to your question
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Willer is yes we can
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
definitely absorb the decrease in
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue I'd be Happ to answer any other
 
00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have but that's
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
the gist of it thank you representative
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
ery to assuage just this is a Policy Act
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
actual question but just to assuage some
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
concern that may
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
exist each one of the facilities that
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
hires one of these individuals would
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
then if registration ceases would then
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
be responsible for establishing the
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures to any
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
individual coming in contact with uh any
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
medicine and then the liability would
 
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
shift from the re registrant to the
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
facility yes it's typically required as
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
part of their accreditation um the
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
accrediting bodies usually require at
 
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
least suspicious based testing for
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
example if there's concerns about
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
diversion this is the issue that this
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
particular registration was trying to
 
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
capture the other thing that the policy
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee considered was the fact that
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
we've had registra but because we
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
haven't had a quorum even if we have
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
received complaints which we have we
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
have not been able to actually remove

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes uh I've read this bill
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
and um um also just to let you know I
 
00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:01.399 align:start position:0%
worked at the Department of Education
 
00:32:06.549 --> 00:32:06.559 align:start position:0%
for 32 years and so I'm familiar with um
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of their
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
operations the this bill the first
 
00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
section of this
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
bill adds to the
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um this this this
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
section the first part the section
 
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's being amended is actually Ru
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
making so it's adding to the department
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
the um process
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
of um doing criminal history record
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
checks for people who apply for
 
00:32:41.789 --> 00:32:41.799 align:start position:0%
certification usually is teachers but it
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
could be any kind of employee of a
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
school district and that's something
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
that people have been asking for for
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
quite a while because it's a kind of
 
00:32:54.029 --> 00:32:54.039 align:start position:0%
tedious process for the SAU try to
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
trying to do that if they have one
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
person who who can do that at the
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
department that would be
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
great the second part starting with line
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
11 has to do with
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
creating um a new fund a
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund and what's interesting
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
about this is that they already have
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
such a fund it's been exist in existence
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
for a long time I I just have to
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
speculate on why this is even in here um
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
I know that they reorganized the
 
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:35.960 align:start position:0%
department about six or seven years ago
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
so they I think they originally had four
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
divisions but they changed the
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the division they
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
sorted them a different way and
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
so uh this is probably to to some people
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the department this looks like a new
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility for one of those
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
bureaus so I think that's why they
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
probably put it in here but I spoke to
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
both the state treasurer and Dena I
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
think her last name is call she works in
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
admin services and she keeps track of
 
00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:17.720 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds and she said that it
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
would be better not to create a new fund
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
but to just um alter some of the
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
characteristics of how that dedicated
 
00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:32.919 align:start position:0%
fund is listed in the in the directory
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
of dedicated funds I know that that I
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the report that the department
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
files for dedicated funds and for this
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
one it has the RSA reference is
 
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
incorrect so that's but that's something
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
that can be fixed without without doing
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
it in this bill Dena also told me that
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education is up for
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
their fiveyear review of dedicated funds
 
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
and that that can be addressed when she
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
does that this summer which I think
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
would be a good idea because I I think
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
that that's this is not the only fund
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
that they dedicated fund that they have
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
that needs a little bit of fixing I mean
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
the funds are there and they've been
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
used for decades but they may want may
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
want to um straighten out some of the
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
titles that this particular one has two
 
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
different titles within the context of
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
that dedicated fund report and the index
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
it has one name and the report that's
 
00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
filed by the department has slightly
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
different name so they can address all
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
of those issues that are probably
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
related to their
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization this summer all right so
 
00:35:50.309 --> 00:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
you believe this this bill is
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I I think we should
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
probably check with the with the
 
00:35:58.309 --> 00:35:58.319 align:start position:0%
education committee but I think they
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
probably need the first part of it but
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
not the second
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
part so they they need to they need B
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
well which wouldn't be a one anymore it
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
could just be a b but they don't need
 
00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
the part um that has to do with a new
 
00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:16.390 align:start position:0%
the part um that has to do with a new
dedicated

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
fund uh what about the the first part
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
that has processing of criminal history
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
record checks does that cost additional
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
money I think they I think they probably
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
need it but I would need to check we
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
would need to check on that to be sure
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
this is this section is actually you
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
can't tell by looking at the bill but
 
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
this is actually Ru
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
making so I I don't know the status of
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
that I do know that the issue of
 
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:46.720 align:start position:0%
criminal records check and having the
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
department of education do it instead of
 
00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
individual school districts and saus has
 
00:36:57.150 --> 00:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
been an issue for several years so my
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
guess is that the intent is to say the
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
dep the Department of Education is going
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
to do it but I I have not had
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to verify that okay thank
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
PL is there anybody here who's going to
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
put an amendment in to the what you
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
think the bill should be if not what why
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
don't we just itl
 
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
it so so I would be willing to do an
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
amendment um I just need um some kind of
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
um understanding of the criminal records
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
check being in rules just to find out if
 
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
check being in rules just to find out if
that's

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
needed okay but not but I would delete
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
the second part all right well to your
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
point if that technically can be in or
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
is in or can be in rules then then this
 
00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
whole thing is not necessary uh
 
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.589 align:start position:0%
whole thing is not necessary uh
representative

00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
lle I was just wondering if if when we
 
00:37:59.069 --> 00:37:59.079 align:start position:0%
have a work session if we could invite a
 
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
member of the department to make sure
 
00:38:04.829 --> 00:38:04.839 align:start position:0%
we're on the right track to answer
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
questions can yeah we can certainly try
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
Aly yes
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
um the representative gave us uh gave me
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
on two possible r on dedicated fund
 
00:38:32.109 --> 00:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
or and neither of them is that 123 is
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
certified program fund for RSA
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
332e and I just went to that and it's
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
water treatment plant
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
operators so and the other one was was
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
is very late in the list and has already
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
been repealed okay so I the numbers are
 
00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
one two and three and I I got the order
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
of them wrong but they're but they're
 
00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:07.079 align:start position:0%
both those so both um Department of
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
Education funds and one of them is the
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
certification one it could be
 
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
312 and
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
213 well anything starting with three is
 
00:39:22.309 --> 00:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
in the last few years and you said it's
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
been there a long time so that's another
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:28.870 align:start position:0%
been there a long time so that's another
thing

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
here let me see uh one two three is in
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
acquisition no no sorry I'm
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
not well we can we can I guess we can
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
work on this later yeah we can work on
 
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
this later so I'm just I'm just coming
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
back from a doctor's appointment so I
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have my notes here
 
00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:58.349 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have my notes here
yet

00:39:58.349 --> 00:39:58.359 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
well I guess we're not in a hurry
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
because we can't hear anything else
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
until 11:
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
right and it doesn't appear to be anyone
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
else it's quarter of
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
11 oh yeah we've only got 15 minutes for
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
this one oh I don't know I don't know if
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
goodness 132 is a so um
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
facilities repr Ames I just want I just
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to say it's pretty obvious and
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
supportive representative Le please
 
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we need um a
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable person from the Department
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
of educ ation
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
to explain what's needed and what's not
 
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
needed um I don't
 
00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
think you probably got it exactly right
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
representative fellows but let's let's
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
I okay does anybody have anything else I
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
me well you can if you go if you're
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the dedicated funds report
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
just search for the
 
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.870 align:start position:0%
just search for the
word

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
certification yeah that one 123 is a
 
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:36.640 align:start position:0%
certification program fund but it refers
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
you to RSA
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
332e which is water
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
stuff now maybe the referral is
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
wrong to to which place it's going well
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's inconsistencies between the
 
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
index and the reports that the
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
department filed at the and so you think
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
you is it called C what's the number for
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
certification one uh two3 is a
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
certification program fund so that's the
 
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
one we're talking
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
about except yeah so if so the RSA RSA
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
it's in 612 it's referring it to this
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
water fund right so that may be
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
wrong okay well given the the
 
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
uncertainty there I think we'll I'm
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
assuming there's no one else to testify
 
00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
there's um there's no other pin cards
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
and therefore I will close the public
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:55.150 align:start position:0%
 
1655

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:42:59.710 --> 00:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:34.270 align:start position:0%
 
upat

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
Farms the other ones 31 two one two
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
three if you when I when I put in one
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.910 align:start position:0%
 
also

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
hold so that
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
did you print it out yeah I did okay I
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
was rushed out without it I only meeting
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
at 9:30 which one was that so you search
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
on it and you go down to the bottom of
 
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:10.280 align:start position:0%
the report you find that one page thing
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the department submits yeah and the
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
RSA that it's referred to in there is at
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
least it's a Department of Education RSA
 
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
but it's not it's to a division it
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
refers to a division that is that I know
 
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:32.920 align:start position:0%
is the one that used to be where
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
certification was but they re redid that
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
whole Division and now it belongs
 
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.630 align:start position:0%
whole Division and now it belongs
somewhere

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
else but mostly they don't they've got a
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:38.190 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
I was rushing back here trying to be
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
here for that one and I talked I I sent
 
00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
them an email last week asking them
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
about that bill you would think that
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
would trigger somebody to be here
 
00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't or at least clean it up or
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't or at least clean it up or
both

00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that probably
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
one okay the time being 1047 we will get
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
going on I will open the public hearing
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
on HB 1198 and first up I get up again
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
for recognize representative uh
 
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.349 align:start position:0%
for recognize representative uh
Horgan

00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
Horgan
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so I'm
 
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
represent Timothy Horgan from the town
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
of straford County the town of Durham
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
which is uh the entirety of straford
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
County District 10 which actually does
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
not have a state liquor store in its
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
Town although we do have one next door
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
in Lee
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
so this bill uh sailed through Commerce
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh without much controversy it's not
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
particularly complicated So currently
 
00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:55.400 align:start position:0%
the state liquor the state liquor store
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
the state Liquor Commission can and does
 
00:46:59.030 --> 00:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
keep stores open on Main routes where
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
traffic is busy On Any Sunday or legal
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
holiday with the three exceptions of
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
Easter Thanksgiving and Christmas and uh
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
the dates of Thanksgiving and Christmas
 
00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:10.839 align:start position:0%
are clearly established in existing law
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
so uh we pretty much know when the
 
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:15.240 align:start position:0%
everybody knows when those uh those
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
holidays are Easter's a little bit
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
trickier first of all it's not actually
 
00:47:21.549 --> 00:47:21.559 align:start position:0%
technically a legal holiday moves around
 
00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:23.079 align:start position:0%
from year to year and actually different
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
religious groups observe it on different
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
Sundays um which I guess and the lakor
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
commission uses the most common date
 
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
which is observed by most Christian
 
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
denominations and this year if I
 
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
remember correctly that's March
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
31st um the law doesn't have any
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
definition of Easter and that bill makes
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
no attempt to deal with that um that
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
won't be needed if this bill becomes law
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
actually because there's only one other
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
statute that refers to Easter of course
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is the money commission it's a
 
00:47:52.829 --> 00:47:52.839 align:start position:0%
straight so the main point is um there
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
it's enabling legislation it merely
 
00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
gives a commission the option to keep
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
stores open on those three days the
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
commission is free to keep the stores
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
closed instead and the full-time
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
employees would make one and a half time
 
00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:06.599 align:start position:0%
their regular pay and all the other work
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
rules would still apply so the this is
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the money committee so the main thing is
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission will make more
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
money if HP 1198 passes so sales on
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
Easter Sunday um and I think this is
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
reflected in the fiscal note are like to
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
be similar to those on other March or
 
00:48:25.950 --> 00:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
April Sundays historically the stores
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
grow sales average about a million
 
00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollar on those Sundays with labor costs
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
averaging about 53,000 and that's pretty
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
much the only cost of keeping the store
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
open since they have to keep the lights
 
00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
on and the air conditioning on
 
00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.119 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether there's any
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
customers in the store so the potential
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
so that you know that's like a pretty
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
big uh so there's big fiscal upside to
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
being open on on on Easter Sunday the
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
potential profits from opening at
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
christm thanks you be Christmas are
 
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
harder to predict but but um sales
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
leading up to those two days are are are
 
00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:01.799 align:start position:0%
robust that's what it says in the fiscal
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
notes so should be financially worth
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
worthwhile opening in those two holidays
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
evening sales were as little as 5.3% of
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
what they would be on a normal day and I
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
think they should be much higher than
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
5.3 and also this also enables the
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
commission to serve the public better by
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
getting them more opportunity to buy
 
00:49:22.589 --> 00:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
wine and spirits um and mostly this
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
would mostly probably be people who are
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
traveling in need to Breck up a few
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
bottles of uh for responsible enjoyment
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
at the Holiday get togethers although
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
may also be useful since restaurants
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
some restaurants are open in that day
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
some Caterers happen to be um working on
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
that day um you know catering holiday
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
celebrations and that probably makes
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
life a little bit easier for them if
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
they need to uh if they discover they
 
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
have less Wier Spirits than they than
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
they need to serve their customers so I
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
think this uh I think this bill will
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
make a significant amount of money for
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
this State Liquor Commission so and this
 
00:49:59.309 --> 00:49:59.319 align:start position:0%
so from the point of view of the waying
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
me committee's concerns um I think
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's I think this is like pretty
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
obviously a bill that you you should
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
pass and send on to the Senate so i' be
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you want
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um before I take questions
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
I'll just remind the committee that this
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
bill and and I believe all of them that
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
we are hearing today are second
 
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee bills the policy has been
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
passed so whether you whether you like
 
00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
this bill or not um the has been passed
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
previously so we are focused only on the
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
financial aspects of this bill and the
 
00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
following bills and now represent
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative plot this is a money
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah um you you I understand
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
that there may be a revenue increase
 
00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
potential yes of course but wouldn't
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
being open on those three holidays just
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
suck some revenue from other days around
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
the holidays um that may be the case but
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
in practice The Liquor Commission stays
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
open as many days as it can so they
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're obviously
 
00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
their analysis the business seems to
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
indicate that they would make more sales
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
staying up in more days so that's uh you
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
know they I believe all the major sto
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
and this actually it says certain stores
 
00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
this is actually probably most of the
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
stores um so they do I believe they do
 
00:51:12.750 --> 00:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
mostly stay open seven days a week if
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
they can because they figure they'll uh
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
sell more more product uh if they
 
00:51:20.789 --> 00:51:20.799 align:start position:0%
overall if they stay open you know rub
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
me every day thank you but you've read
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
the original fiscal note which is still
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note yes and the original
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on had says that the Liquor
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
Commission believes that they can lose
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
money by doing this I that their
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures are going to increase
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have to keep uh
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
people at time and a half there yes on
 
00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.789 align:start position:0%
people at time and a half there yes on
which

00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
is on apparently more than they are
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
paying people for normal days except
 
00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:04.599 align:start position:0%
Sundays and also that um they don't
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
really believe that very many people are
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
going to be wandering around and and
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
making a last minute purchase because
 
00:52:13.789 --> 00:52:13.799 align:start position:0%
they've always made them in the days
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
before and after well I I was not
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
involved in writing the fiscal notes so
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
I can't speak too much with their
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions where I mean they're being
 
00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh I think they're being cautious
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
because they knew last time we
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
introduced it it became controversial on
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
the other the other body that we don't
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
talk about but um it's
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
uh I think how they describe the the
 
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
labor costs um that's a relatively small
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
amount of what they would what they
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
would sell um they it's a business
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
decision that the Liquor Commission like
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
any other retailer should be free to
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
make for itself and in fact they stay
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
open on all the other legal holidays
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
other than Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
and Christmas and they also uh stay open
 
00:52:57.069 --> 00:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
on every Sunday aside from Easter Sunday
 
00:52:59.710 --> 00:52:59.720 align:start position:0%
so I think they their analysis of
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
businesses is that it's uh worthwhile
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
keeping the stores open as many days as
 
00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
possible even if that does mean labor
 
00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:09.559 align:start position:0%
costs which I think are not uh not
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
really not really huge part of their
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
business their main cost is actually
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
just the cost of maintaining the stores
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
and also like the cost of buying the
 
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:19.960 align:start position:0%
product not so much the salaries that
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
the liquor store clerks make when the
 
00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:25.640 align:start position:0%
stores open so that's that's my belie
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
follow up thank
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
you on did The Liquor Commission come to
 
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:31.190 align:start position:0%
you on did The Liquor Commission come to
the

00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
hearing to recall that I seem to recall
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
that they uh they did to the Commerce
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing so they
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
um um you can uh that would probably be
 
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
reflected in the bill file which I don't
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
have a copy of and
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if there's anybody here
 
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:49.240 align:start position:0%
to speak to it but um they they they did
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
they did they did come to and they were
 
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
I think not they certainly did not try
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
to dissuade me or also uh
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
there there are other members of the uh
 
00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
committee this is a this is a identical
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed in the previous
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
session as amended by the Commerce
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
Committee so
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
um representative fellows followed by
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes and so one of the
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
concerns is is what would overtime cost
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
because the employees that would be in
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
the store would be working
 
00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:26.200 align:start position:0%
overtime I these are the regular sea
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
employ um
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
Union people that would be impacted by
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
this it's this is something that would
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to be addressed in the labor
 
00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
contract yes so so I'm I'm wondering if
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
they used um time and a
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
half for for work on a Sunday but I
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
think that it's possible either they
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
have or it could be negotiated if
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to work on a holiday and
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of these major holidays that
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
they may be entitled to more than that
 
00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
they get time in a half for overtime but
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
they're also on it's on a major holiday
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that could cost even
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
more so was did you hear any discussions
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
issue that was not discussed I will
 
00:55:19.789 --> 00:55:19.799 align:start position:0%
point to the fact on other legal
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
holidays The Liquor Commission has made
 
00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:23.480 align:start position:0%
a business decision to keep most of the
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
larger stores open so they
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
they uh they must believe the additional
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
labor cost offsets uh offsets the uh is
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
is is is more than sufficient the
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
revenues from having the clerks in the
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
store are uh more than sufficient to be
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
justify having the clerks there
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
obviously this is an issue that has to
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
be discussed in the labor contract and
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
they do have a strong union I mean it's
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
a fair it's I think it's generally
 
00:55:52.750 --> 00:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
considered a good place to work but they
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
do have a strong union they'll discuss
 
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:56.440 align:start position:0%
this is merely in enabling legislation
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
which enables The Liquor Commission to
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know suggest having the stores open
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
those two days that I can't speak to
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
whether whether what would happen in the
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh any contract negotiations between the
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh Liquor Commission and the sea
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
00:56:17.309 --> 00:56:17.319 align:start position:0%
plat yes uh to counter the question I
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
made earlier uh this this only the the
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
law say is if this passes
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
May the commission may in its discretion
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
open those days so I suppose if this
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
passes The Liquor Commission could try a
 
00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
few stores see what the revenue impact
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
is see if the revenue impact is higher
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
than what they lose the previous days
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
and if it's worth it keep it doing it
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
not they don't have to right exactly so
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to them to make the bus
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
business decision and I'm sure they'll
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll uh give it I'm sure
 
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
they won't I'm sure they'll like look at
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
the data if if they do start opening
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
stores on those three days they'll look
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
at the data from to see if it's
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to do it the next year or not
 
00:57:04.109 --> 00:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Bolton uh
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so uh this has
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
happened in the past where um
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative PL has spoken or address
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
the question that I would like to do so
 
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
um but how many stores I I thought maybe
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
if this was like a liquor commission's
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
policy that all stores would have to
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
honor you know opening on on all the
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
holidays if if if we go in that
 
00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
direction I didn't think stores had that
 
00:57:31.829 --> 00:57:31.839 align:start position:0%
discretion well I can't guess I'm not an
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
expert exactly how the State Liquor
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
Commission organizes its stores I mean
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're um they're all so that that I
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
can't argue exactly but do know they
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
they are opening more stores and keeping
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
them open they seem to be keeping them
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
open as long as you know they can keep
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
them staffed so they're they um so they
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
they do seem to be making decision to
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
have more stores newer stores larger
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
stores and uh to have to you know keep
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
them sufficiently staffed so I don't
 
00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
think they're they're not uh I don't
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
think they're closing stores because of
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
the labor cost per se so I think they're
 
00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
they're in an expansion mode so
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
I I don't I'm not necessarily the best
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
person to answer that question so uh
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Oris did you have a
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr
 
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative Horgan
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
here I am uh let's see Representatives
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
Platt and Bolton have already taken the
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
Thunder out of what I wanted to
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
ask so uh what I what I was wondering is
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
if uh do you think selling additional
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
spirits and spiritual holidays would
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
enhance the
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
spirits you don't have to answer that no
 
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we could have a spirit of debate
 
00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:53.710 align:start position:0%
that we could have a spirit of debate
about

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.670 align:start position:0%
about
that

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:58.349 --> 00:58:58.359 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
fellows so one of the things I see when
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
I read this it says like right now
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
full-time employees are not obligated to
 
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
work on Sunday or these three holidays
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's by it's you know voluntary if they
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
want to work on Sundays but you by
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
Crossing out um you know
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
this how you how you're amending the
 
00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:25.039 align:start position:0%
bill you're saying that they they're not
 
00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
obligated to work on Sundays but they
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
would be obligated to work on Easter and
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
Christmas because you're Crossing out
 
00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:36.069 align:start position:0%
Christmas because you're Crossing out
those

00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
words correct well I think we're just uh
 
00:59:42.029 --> 00:59:42.039 align:start position:0%
the way I interpret it um the way I
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
interpret this this has like
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh it this has this B has passed the
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
house before it came halfway passing the
 
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:52.760 align:start position:0%
other body but I think what that means
 
00:59:55.349 --> 00:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
is just places those three days on the
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
same um so places Easter Sunday um on
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
the same and the same so the law that
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
appli to all the other 51 Sundays of the
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
year would apply to Easter Sunday and
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
then the law that applies on on the
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
other legal holidays uh would also apply
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
to those two holiday so I don't think it
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
changes uh so I think those um so I
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
don't think it changes anything in the
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
law or the labor contract necessarily uh
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
B beyond what already exists for all the
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
other holidays and all the other days
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
so rep representative elberger thank you
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um just comment on
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's statement
 
01:00:38.670 --> 01:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
following the stricken language there is
 
01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
a sentence that says although full-time
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
employees shall be given the option of
 
01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:44.839 align:start position:0%
working no such employee shall be
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
required to work on such days so
 
01:00:51.789 --> 01:00:51.799 align:start position:0%
employees will not be forced to work on
 
01:00:51.799 --> 01:00:52.789 align:start position:0%
employees will not be forced to work on
those

01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:55.589 --> 01:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
days I'm
 
01:00:55.599 --> 01:00:56.430 align:start position:0%
days I'm
I'm

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
assuming that the Liquor Commission
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
which seems to be doing a pretty good
 
01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
job of
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
managing the finances of the
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
commission uh unless they have any
 
01:01:12.109 --> 01:01:12.119 align:start position:0%
serious objection to this and I I I'm
 
01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:17.240 align:start position:0%
not noticing any yet at least then there
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't from my perspective there
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a re any reason to turn
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
this down as it is simply enabling
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
legislation it is not a
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
requirement representative sodi thank
 
01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
you uh do you have any information from
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
other states that are open on these
 
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
holidays uh how much money they're
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
bringing in on those dates um well
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
frankly no we're one of the few states
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
that has State uh state liquor stores of
 
01:01:47.549 --> 01:01:47.559 align:start position:0%
course I mean well I mean but on the
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
private uh businesses that would be open
 
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
on those States um I haven't contact any
 
01:01:55.150 --> 01:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
private businesses I mean I have noticed
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that liquor stores well our
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of Massachusetts has
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
all private Liquor Stores um and they
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
most of them do stay open on Sunday I
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
don't believe they used to have Blue
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
laws in Massachusetts but they don't but
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
I think most of those two stay open as
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
many days as they can just like the
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%

01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
you representative ery
 
01:30:57.390 --> 01:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I had asked um um Mr Lambert
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
Over in legislative research to give us
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
some background on this I forward it to
 
01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
you you may wish to forward it to the
 
01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:07.239 align:start position:0%
committee uh or not it's up to you but
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
primarily what this is is the probate
 
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.350 align:start position:0%
primarily what this is is the probate
judge

01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
judge
 
01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
said that this should be uh on
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
legislative action because the state was
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
involved and Rich did some further
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
research and came up and said that
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
historically the uh General Court
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
handled intestate uh decisions regarding
 
01:31:32.750 --> 01:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the disposition of funds this is merely
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
a disposition of fund it doesn't do
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
anything other than give money to where
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
the guy wanted it to go and which
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
includes the state so okay thank you I
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%

hearing just to provide any background
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's necessary I have some written
 
01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
explanation because our office was
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
involved in the underlying matter um so
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh our office I'm Michael Haley the
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%

Probate Estates that have charitable
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
bequests um this particular estate um Mr
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
teest Bano died without a will so it was
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
unusual for us to be involved in this um
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
however the the administrator of his
 
01:32:37.950 --> 01:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
estate was his good friend and wanted to
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
um have the the proceeds of his estate
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
go to a a charitable purpose um and the
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
judge asked us to become involved to
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
determine if there was a way to achieve
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
that through the probate process um we
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed it and found that um RSA
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
5611 provides that if someone dies in
 
01:32:59.709 --> 01:32:59.719 align:start position:0%
tested without any living family within
 
01:33:02.270 --> 01:33:02.280 align:start position:0%
the fourth degree that the money goes to
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
the state um and so in order to uh have
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
that money be directed to a particular
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
purpose the legislature would need to be
 
01:33:12.189 --> 01:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
the the body that made that decision um
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
so that the judge entered an order to
 
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
that effect um and I understand that the
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
executive or the administrator of his
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
will worked with the representative to
 
01:33:22.149 --> 01:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
draft this bill and this is the result
 
01:33:24.109 --> 01:33:24.119 align:start position:0%
of those efforts so I'm available if
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
there are any questions about that
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
underlying proceeding but our office is
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
not taking a position on this
 
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you and uh those some
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
of those comments are in line with
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh what representative
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
Ellery had found out from uh Mr Lambert
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
so that's good to hear does anyone have
 
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
any questions representative fellows I I
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
just have a te technical um question
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
about the process because this is not
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
amending any RSA which is what we
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
usually see for builds so is this called
 
01:33:56.910 --> 01:33:56.920 align:start position:0%
a chapter law and like how do how is it
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
recorded in record because we're going
 
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
to vote on it um that's a little bit
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
outside of my area of expertise I
 
01:34:03.390 --> 01:34:03.400 align:start position:0%
understand this to essentially be an
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation that money has come into
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the estate from Mr bhanu's estate he had
 
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:09.109 align:start position:0%
the estate from Mr bhanu's estate he had
about

01:34:09.109 --> 01:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
$131,000 I believe when he passed and so
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
this is simply appropriating that money
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
to a particular purpose in this case
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
with the DHHS um Refugee and
 
01:34:17.639 --> 01:34:18.709 align:start position:0%
with the DHHS um Refugee and
resettlement

01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
resettlement
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.189 --> 01:34:34.199 align:start position:0%

01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
questiones reading the Dr
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
methodology will money from

paid from that money's coming to
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
administer this uh so our office is not

receiving any money we're not in uh we
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be receiving anything the the
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
money would go from his estate so the
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
the executive would cut a check to the
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
treasury um it would go into General
 
01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
funds and this is appropriating out of
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.790 align:start position:0%

good morning my name is Keen M Wong tax
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
policy council with the New Hampshire
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue and my name is
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
Bruce canu I'm the municipal supervisor
 
01:47:34.109 --> 01:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
at the Department of
 
01:47:36.550 --> 01:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh the department does not take
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill right now uh
 
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
what's coming around to you is the
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal noqu guide uh which is the um
 
01:47:45.950 --> 01:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
quick gu of the fiscal note that was
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
prepared by the department when it was
 
01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:49.310 align:start position:0%
prepared by the department when it was
first

01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:58.870 align:start position:0%
first
introduced

01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
so I I'll not read through the uh the
 
01:48:03.589 --> 01:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
fiscal no quick guy but essentially
 
01:48:06.830 --> 01:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
um the uh what the department has read
 
01:48:10.589 --> 01:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
the bill uh trying to accomplish is to
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
take uh any excess monies from the games
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
of chance in excess of the $6.6 million
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
and use that excess money to uh to
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh the swept calculation of
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
the $363
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
million uh upon um reviewing this bill
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
the department found that there are
 
01:48:35.550 --> 01:48:35.560 align:start position:0%
certain areas uh that might be of
 
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
concern um that might potentially help
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
improve um the
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
bill uh first thing is that the bill
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
does not clearly stipulate the uh the
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
date range of the uh of the payments
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
that was deposit that that would be
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
deposited into the uh education trust
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
fund um and so the department being
 
01:48:57.159 --> 01:48:58.070 align:start position:0%
fund um and so the department being
having

01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
to uh create or or calculate uh the tax
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
rate to arrive at the $363 million uh
 
01:49:08.950 --> 01:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
will need uh specific information as to
 
01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh what amount will be in excess of the
 
01:49:13.910 --> 01:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
$6.6 million and um how that amount
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
would be um will be calculated so would
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
that information be coming directly from
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
Treasury or would that be a a
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
calculation that was to be done by the
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
department so that's not clear on the
 
01:49:28.510 --> 01:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
bill itself uh it would be definitely be
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the department if uh if
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is made clear uh if this bill is to
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
pass uh and if this uh if that
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
information was to come from from
 
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
another party let's say from from
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
treasury uh the department would request
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
that maybe a uh a timeline be provided
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill to State when the
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
information will be provided to us to
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
perform the calculation uh that the
 
01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
preferred date would be uh early
 
01:49:54.990 --> 01:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
September hopefully maybe by September 1
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
um so that we can start um preparing the
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
calculation and we'll be happy to take
 
01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:04.790 align:start position:0%
calculation and we'll be happy to take
any

01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.189 --> 01:50:08.199 align:start position:0%
questions represented
 
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
um so the
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
Dr needs to know at at some year in the
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
future if we pass this bill Dr needs to
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
know how much to reduce the
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
swep um warrant
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
by and so so the question one question
 
01:50:38.109 --> 01:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
is when is that
 
01:50:42.430 --> 01:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
known and my guess
 
01:50:46.950 --> 01:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
is you the Department of Education would
 
01:50:49.069 --> 01:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
probably have to tell you that and
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be tell telling you that
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
for what
 
01:50:55.149 --> 01:50:55.159 align:start position:0%
happened the year
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
before is that you're not how you see it
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
um I I I was thinking that probably the
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
information would come from treasury as
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to Department of Education but
 
01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not certain because it's
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
talking about the deposits into the game
 
01:51:15.189 --> 01:51:15.199 align:start position:0%
um there's a specific fund for the game
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
of chance um and I believe that would be
 
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:26.669 --> 01:51:26.679 align:start position:0%
treasury representative PL I'm having
 
01:51:29.069 --> 01:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
trouble understanding let's say it was
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
6.6 million consistently you knew that
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
this would Reduce swep by 6.6 million so
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
it would not okay what would it do uh no
 
01:51:41.229 --> 01:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
according to the language of the bill it
 
01:51:43.629 --> 01:51:43.639 align:start position:0%
will be reducing the 363 Million by
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
anything in excess of the $6.6
 
01:51:50.069 --> 01:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
million given that let's say there is is
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
an excess of say a million so it reduces
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
swept by a million that reduces the
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
revenue from swept uh does it also
 
01:51:58.990 --> 01:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the amounts going back to the
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities as a result of that
 
01:52:03.189 --> 01:52:03.199 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh yes I believe yes that's
 
01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.870 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh yes I believe yes that's
correct

01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
yeah R El me um did you try to find out
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
what the on
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
amount that has been coming out of game
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
these games of Champs there it's a
 
01:52:30.149 --> 01:52:30.159 align:start position:0%
narrow SE sector on has looked like for
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years
 
01:52:35.189 --> 01:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
say or you're just assuming that it's
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to grow yeah I I we did not look
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
through the history of the uh of the
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
game of chain Revenue I believe uh
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
through well I believe reading the bill
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
I think the 6.6 million was the either
 
01:52:52.390 --> 01:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
the budgeted amount or was the last the
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
last um fiscal Year's amount of the of
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
the uh revenue from Game of CH I'm I'm
 
01:52:59.830 --> 01:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
not sure if um
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
if I I don't know what uh what was done
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
in the past uh in developing this bill
 
01:53:08.109 --> 01:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
whether fortunately we do have have
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay uh yes represent
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair thanks for
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question there may actually be
 
01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.310 align:start position:0%
taking my question there may actually be
two

01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
where this 6.6
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
million whose pocket is it going to be
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
coming out of is it going to be coming
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
out of the owners is it going to be
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of the gambling Commission
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
because there's a pot of money there'll
 
01:53:46.189 --> 01:53:46.199 align:start position:0%
be $6.6 million less under this proposal
 
01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
who's not getting
 
01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.709 align:start position:0%
who's not getting
it

01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:53:52.390 --> 01:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that there is a
 
01:53:55.550 --> 01:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
transfer of money from the uh of the
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
excess of $6.6
 
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
million I believe it's just an
 
01:54:01.310 --> 01:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
accounting to
 
01:54:06.149 --> 01:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
reduce the um the 363 Million by the
 
01:54:08.589 --> 01:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
number in exess of 6.6 I I don't believe
 
01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
there's any kind of transfer from one
 
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:13.320 align:start position:0%
from One Fund to another fund Mr
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
chairman follow yes
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
follow I'm I'm trying
 
01:54:20.030 --> 01:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
to the amount going into swep with be
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
reduced by this amount which be would be
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
coming out of games of
 
01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.310 align:start position:0%
coming out of games of
chance

01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
chance
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
correct uh that's
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's I don't believe I can answer that
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
question um according to the bill it
 
01:54:34.589 --> 01:54:34.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the money will be
 
01:54:36.550 --> 01:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
coming out of the games of chance it
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
just says that the amount that's an
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
excess of $6.6 million is used to reduce
 
01:54:46.109 --> 01:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
the um the 363 million
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
calculation okay I may need to ask
 
01:54:50.910 --> 01:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
someone else this question thank you Mr
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
chairman yes billsburg so isn't it the
 
01:54:58.109 --> 01:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
case that all of the uh uh funds from
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission currently go into
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund so isn't this
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
isn't the education trust fund the
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
answer to the question so because
 
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
this takes anything in excess of 6.6
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
million that's a credit against the
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
amount to be collected from the
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
municipalities through the property tax
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's a wash yes sir the the bill the
 
01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill I think states that it's still
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
going those revenues to the education
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund it's the excess above 6.6
 
01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:36.639 align:start position:0%
million that is a number that is coming
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
to Dr so that we can raise instead of
 
01:55:44.350 --> 01:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
363 million in that example of a million
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
excess so by a number you mean it's an
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
accounting adjustment as Kean had
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
suggested it's not an actual transfer of
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
funds right right okay that's how I
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
too okay any other
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none no represent
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
fellows um yes I'm trying to think about
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the um education trust
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
fund as a
 
01:56:14.639 --> 01:56:16.310 align:start position:0%
fund as a
whole

01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:56:19.709 --> 01:56:19.719 align:start position:0%
how would this money be specifically
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
identified on a separate line I'm just
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot of things a lot of
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
different programs are funded out of the
 
01:56:28.350 --> 01:56:28.360 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.069 align:start position:0%
education trust
fund

01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
and this is kind of a it's kind of
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
saying a little slice of what's going
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
into the education fund will be used for
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
this one very
 
01:56:46.990 --> 01:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
specific um you know
 
01:56:50.910 --> 01:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
use and if somehow that needs to be
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.950 --> 01:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
fund representative fellows I
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
would from our perspective in Municipal
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking for that accounting number
 
01:57:09.870 --> 01:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
so that the next swept warrant or
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
warrants in total would raise in this
 
01:57:16.669 --> 01:57:16.679 align:start position:0%
hypothetical $1 million less
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
proportioned out to all the the
 
01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.709 align:start position:0%
proportioned out to all the the
municipalities

01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
it's Gaming revenue that's going to be
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the education trust fund at least as
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
I would understand it but it's not going
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
to be a million dollars raised through
 
01:57:33.520 --> 01:57:34.430 align:start position:0%
to be a million dollars raised through
the

01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:37.229 --> 01:57:37.239 align:start position:0%
swept tax the property
 
01:57:42.229 --> 01:57:42.239 align:start position:0%
tax so what happens to the monies in the
 
01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
fund coming in from The Gaming
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
revenue is then uh
 
01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
well it's you know it's not dr's Affair
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
you were right it would be education and
 
01:57:58.510 --> 01:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
the law dictating how those funds are
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
then um appropriated out and so forth
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
but this looks to me like a just a
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
change from a million dollars on swept
 
01:58:11.390 --> 01:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
to a million dollars into the education
 
01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.229 align:start position:0%
to a million dollars into the education
trust

01:58:13.229 --> 01:58:13.239 align:start position:0%
trust
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:20.910 --> 01:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
revenue but but again it's Mechanics for
 
01:58:23.069 --> 01:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
the municipal Bureau and really our
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
interest was in the timing of the of
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
that piece of data and and the amount
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
and the determination in the statute as
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.910 --> 01:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
calculation representative
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
ducet thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if I'm
 
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
understanding this
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
correctly I would assume the intent of
 
01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill would would be to lessen
 
01:58:54.109 --> 01:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
the tax burden on the taxpayer down
 
01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:56.639 align:start position:0%
Downstream but what I'm hearing in the
 
01:58:58.990 --> 01:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
testimony is if it's if the dollars
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
aren't in the education trust
 
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
fund they and they go to swept it it's
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a wash uh accounting wise if if
 
01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:10.840 align:start position:0%
you have those funds there it's not
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
going to affect the the swep
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
rate I mean does doeses this piece of
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
legislation have The Wanted
 
01:59:25.589 --> 01:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
effect I mean the legislative intent I'm
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
reading into it a little bit but it's
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's kind of murky here uh thank you for
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
the question representative um I I don't
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
think we are in the position to talk
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
about the intent of the the bill that
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
might be the uh the sponsor might be
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
able to be more Geared for that um but
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
this is how we've interpreted the uh the
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
bill and and how it's going to
 
01:59:50.669 --> 01:59:50.679 align:start position:0%
work follow okay let let me make that
 
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
assumption okay and I'm asking you will
 
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
that if my intent is to lower the
 
02:00:01.629 --> 02:00:01.639 align:start position:0%
property tax of a property owner uh
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
swept end of things shifting these
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
dollars from one from the Statewide uh
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund to swept
 
02:00:14.589 --> 02:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
is it going to have my intended effect
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
in your in your
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
opinion again sir I'm not entire L
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
certain what the intent might have been
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
but I believe that I can say this if Dr
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
is told that there is a million dollars
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
of Gaming
 
02:00:33.629 --> 02:00:33.639 align:start position:0%
revenue in excess of the 6.6
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
million will'll set the the warrant to
 
02:00:36.719 --> 02:00:37.669 align:start position:0%
million will'll set the the warrant to
raise

02:00:37.669 --> 02:00:37.679 align:start position:0%
raise
 
02:00:40.990 --> 02:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
$362 million and if you're paying that
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
property tax all of it I know this a Hy
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
pathetical you're going to pay less on
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
the your swept tax on your tax bill
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative PL what happens now to uh
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
any excesses in the uh education trust
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
fund does it accumulate it does it off
 
02:01:06.189 --> 02:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
it representative PL I I don't know I'm
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
not qualified to answer that question
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
about the funds that at the state level
 
02:01:16.510 --> 02:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
on the on the education trust fund all
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to let representative
 
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
omy answer it
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
thank you on if there is a surplus left
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year the finance
 
02:01:29.069 --> 02:01:29.079 align:start position:0%
committee can kidnap it for the general
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
fund or send it on and if they do then
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.229 --> 02:01:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
Ames this isn't really a question uh
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
well I'll I'll start with this um if you
 
02:01:55.990 --> 02:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
with your $1 million
 
02:01:58.390 --> 02:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
hypothesis so then you're working with
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
362 million instead of
 
02:02:05.830 --> 02:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
363 and you then uh apply your
 
02:02:09.550 --> 02:02:09.560 align:start position:0%
calculator to the situation and
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
distribute the money um well before you
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
do that you somewhere in there you
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
determine a Statewide rate right right
 
02:02:24.069 --> 02:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
an equalized rate and um right now it's
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere about
 
02:02:30.790 --> 02:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
1.12 or 1.10 something like that anyway
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
low um and when I you go down and you
 
02:02:39.149 --> 02:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
take $1 million and try to spread it out
 
02:02:40.910 --> 02:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
across all our
 
02:02:43.229 --> 02:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
communities it's
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's not going to be very visible is
 
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:47.480 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be a small amount of
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
money except for the the biggest places
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
like Manchester they might it might be
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
visible there am I correct in saying
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
that representative Ames I I I'm not
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
sure how to answer that question um is
 
02:03:06.270 --> 02:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
it visible would be if you compared um
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
the last
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
363 apportionment to
 
02:03:15.629 --> 02:03:15.639 align:start position:0%
362 um it filters down starts out with
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
the dollars raised in each municipality
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that in turn is as you know a
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
portion down to every single taxpayer so
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
um but 1 million over 363 million I'm
 
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
not sure what percent that is but yeah
 
02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
not sure what percent that is but yeah
it

02:03:32.950 --> 02:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
is Ron
 
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
elberger being the non-math genius here
 
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
um what I'm getting from this is that
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
the difference is
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
1.8% in ter if you divide 363
 
02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:50.229 align:start position:0%
1.8% in ter if you divide 363
million

02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
if you go the other way six it turns out
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
to be under
 
02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
2% in terms of the impact on the whole
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
on the Statewide education trust fund so
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
the impact on a tax bill is going to
 
02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:07.719 align:start position:0%
be no it will be visible but I'm not
 
02:04:07.719 --> 02:04:09.350 align:start position:0%
be no it will be visible but I'm not
sure

02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
noticeable represent plat ta it's 0. 2%
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
1 ided 363 is
 
02:04:20.430 --> 02:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
.002 which is 2%
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
227% so fairly negligible representative
 
02:04:28.549 --> 02:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
fellows um so let's talk another
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I I know it's never going
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
to happen but suppose the amount of
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
money raised from the these games of
 
02:04:40.790 --> 02:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
chance was turned out to be
 
02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:42.750 align:start position:0%
chance was turned out to be
$370

02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
$370
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
million then there'd be no Statewide
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
correct so it's 370 million in excess of
 
02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.589 align:start position:0%
correct so it's 370 million in excess of
$6.6

02:04:52.589 --> 02:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
$6.6
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
million yeah so according to the the
 
02:04:56.830 --> 02:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
Lang according to the language of the
 
02:04:59.629 --> 02:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
bill you'll need the 363 minus whatever
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
access if the access is 370 yeah I would
 
02:05:08.430 --> 02:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:14.920 align:start position:0%
answer okay thank you very much thank
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
you I have no more pin cards um is there
 
02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to testify on hb1
 
02:05:23.910 --> 02:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
1517 representative Aly I would like to
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
see on the lottery tell us how much uh
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
is actually coming in for these games of
 
02:05:35.950 --> 02:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
chance they're severely limited in the
 
02:05:38.709 --> 02:05:38.719 align:start position:0%
definitions to the traditional games of
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
okay and we don't tax them
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:06:04.069 align:start position:0%
okay and we don't tax them
much

02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.069 --> 02:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
the committee uh Charlie
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
McIntyre um and Valerie King from the
 
02:06:17.069 --> 02:06:17.079 align:start position:0%
lottery hey questions um so from FY 23
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
the games of chance Revenue after
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
operating expenses was approximately $
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
5.38 million that was the highest year
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
which had been realized in those
 
02:06:28.510 --> 02:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
revenues and that was due to the
 
02:06:32.310 --> 02:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
limit represent fellows yes could thank
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
you could you please tell us
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
specifically um which activities are
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
within um
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
287 ddon
 
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:51.320 align:start position:0%
20 so that that refers to the taxes on
 
02:06:54.149 --> 02:06:54.159 align:start position:0%
the different games a 3% tax on your
 
02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%

53
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 23 yes was the
 
02:07:42.350 --> 02:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
gross was the was the revenue that you
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
received uh 5.66 4 and our expenses were
 
02:07:50.109 --> 02:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
$283,000 which the statute says you are
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
subtracted out yes and then that's the
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
money that was sent to the education
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
trust fund correct that would be the
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
portion of our transfer so approximately
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
$400,000 a month give or take and is
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
that was that a very low year or was
 
02:08:06.950 --> 02:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
that a typical year there was the that
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
was the highest year of games or chance
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue we've realized and that was
 
02:08:12.549 --> 02:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
because of the legislatively approved
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
increase bet limit so under under this
 
02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
bill um if you subtract $6 million from
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
5.3 you're
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
negative you get the
 
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
point yes okay that that was very
 
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
helpful represent
 
02:08:35.270 --> 02:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
ol just as a hypothetical up in Milton
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
somebody won was was 39 million or
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
something like that uh 13.9 million 13
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
there was a three and a nine in there I
 
02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
had all the
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
numbers the uh the question is will that
 
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
increase substantially to the point that
 
02:08:54.990 --> 02:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
we reach the threshold with one big
 
02:08:58.430 --> 02:08:58.440 align:start position:0%
winner no so the mega buuck it's a mega
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
buuck win it's a traditional Lottery
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:09.310 --> 02:09:09.320 align:start position:0%

02:11:52.990 --> 02:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
represent

02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
elme thank you the fiscal
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
note says that um the amended bill which
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
got rid of a bunch of other stuff
 
02:12:08.830 --> 02:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
um on is going to reduce your revenues
 
02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:09.709 align:start position:0%
um on is going to reduce your revenues
by

02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:12:12.030 --> 02:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
10,000 a
 
02:12:12.040 --> 02:12:13.709 align:start position:0%
10,000 a
year

02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
and possibly increase your expenditures
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
by 10,000 a year so those are just
 
02:12:23.189 --> 02:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
estimates the bill as amended would
 
02:12:25.870 --> 02:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
allow producers of acidified foods to do
 
02:12:28.750 --> 02:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
so without a food license so right now
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
they have to if they want to produce
 
02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
these products in a commercial kitchen
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
they pay a $350 annual fee so we are not
 
02:12:40.390 --> 02:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
sure how many would opt not to pursue
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
that license they still could produ to
 
02:12:44.990 --> 02:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
this license should this bill pass but
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
we uh it's we had listed that as an
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
estimate and indeterminable cuz we're
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
not sure how many of those would
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
actually opt out of not needing that
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
license from
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
us and as far as expenditures um due to
 
02:13:01.830 --> 02:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
um this being a higher risk food that
 
02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to be made in a Home
 
02:13:06.270 --> 02:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
Food Kitchen we could project that there
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
might be more increases of foodborn
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
illness that the department would have
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
to investigate and that is why we had
 
02:13:13.589 --> 02:13:13.599 align:start position:0%
estimated there might be some additional
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures due due to that
 
02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:18.870 align:start position:0%
expenditures due due to that
work

02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:13:21.870 --> 02:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
represent fellows can you just tell us
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
some examples of what are what are the
 
02:13:27.350 --> 02:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
foods that would not need the licensed
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
kitchen anymore so this would allow
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
acidified foods to be made in a home
 
02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
kitchen without a license an example of
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
salsa any other
 
02:13:46.030 --> 02:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions represent a PL would it
 
02:13:48.750 --> 02:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
include tomato products as well
 
02:13:52.790 --> 02:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
tomato products it could um us usually
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
um acidified Foods could be tomato
 
02:13:57.189 --> 02:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
products like a a hot sauce that that
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.270 --> 02:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
products okay yes repres
 
02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
bely sorry I'm just trying to get a
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
broader idea of what acidified foods are
 
02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
um so would this include like kombucha
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
or yogurt or like kefir so these
 
02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:21.559 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be fermented products like
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
those these would be Foods where you're
 
02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
adding acid to bring the the natural PH
 
02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:34.790 --> 02:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
you represent fellows thank you I'm I'm
 
02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
wondering like especially when you
 
02:14:39.229 --> 02:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned Tomatoes like canned
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
tomatoes uh will will it be necessary
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
for um your agency to do more INSP
 
02:14:50.109 --> 02:14:50.119 align:start position:0%
inpections of these products when you
 
02:14:53.549 --> 02:14:53.559 align:start position:0%
find them in a in a I don't know
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
wherever you wherever you check them
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
because you know right now you know that
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
they should have had a license to
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
produce them but now they might be um
 
02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
that's actually a policy question well
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking no because I'm Excuse me
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking in terms of more
 
02:15:16.149 --> 02:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
inspections or more time to make
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
inspections because these prodcts will
 
02:15:22.109 --> 02:15:22.119 align:start position:0%
need a closer look no would that
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
impact the
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so so actually the because these
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
products would be exempt from our
 
02:15:31.870 --> 02:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
license and inspection they there
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an anticipated cost due to
 
02:15:34.679 --> 02:15:39.629 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be an anticipated cost due to
increase

02:15:39.629 --> 02:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.069 --> 02:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
inspection okay thank you very
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
much I'm going to close the public
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
02:15:51.549 --> 02:15:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.149 --> 02:15:54.159 align:start position:0%
um I forgot to ask if anyone else wants
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.679 --> 02:16:06.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
am oh
 
02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative spillsbury did
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
you want to speak on the amendment I
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
very quickly could it be simpler uh
 
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:18.440 align:start position:0%
chairman Aaron of uh agriculture
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
environment uh simply pointed out that
 
02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
in the course of amending the bill in
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
their committee they had inadvertently
 
02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
left out the 60-day effective dates so
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
she asked me to do the favor of having
 
02:16:31.589 --> 02:16:31.599 align:start position:0%
this amendment prepared
 
02:16:46.669 --> 02:16:46.679 align:start position:0%

fiscal note uh as we amended in the
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%

fiscal note on this um this this bill
 
02:17:59.469 --> 02:17:59.479 align:start position:0%

02:18:03.549 --> 02:18:03.559 align:start position:0%

1709 yes represent er uh considering
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
that the seals with the forest maybe we
 
02:18:27.549 --> 02:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
should take a trip up and see what a
 
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
like Mr chair I can't tell the forest
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
from the trees well then okay then I
 
02:18:41.429 --> 02:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
necessary all right we have we have one
 
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
bill left um but uh we can't start for
 
02:18:49.309 --> 02:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
another nine
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
forest there's a
 
02:19:02.549 --> 02:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
German children story about kids in
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
forest and gingerbread and ovens
 
02:19:10.830 --> 02:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair yes i' just like to
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
apologize for interrupting you what I
 
02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:15.800 align:start position:0%
was trying to ask is it what I was
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
thinking is that they would need to test
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
those products to see if they really
 
02:19:24.669 --> 02:19:24.679 align:start position:0%
were acidified to whatever level of acid
 
02:19:27.790 --> 02:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
you know would qualify as acidified
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I was thinking they might
 
02:19:31.469 --> 02:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
need more inspectors or take longer to
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:16.359 --> 02:20:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
left

02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.319 --> 02:29:18.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:29:18.870 --> 02:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.309 --> 02:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
one I'm going to open the public hearing
 
02:29:22.070 --> 02:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
on hb1
 
02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.670 --> 02:29:39.680 align:start position:0%

you
 
02:29:55.790 --> 02:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
um so this bill actually if you look at
 
02:29:58.110 --> 02:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
the bill you'll see it says it was the
 
02:29:59.950 --> 02:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
first committee was Health and Human
 
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
Services and it got um
 
02:30:07.309 --> 02:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
sent instead to the special child care
 
02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm on that committee so
 
02:30:12.590 --> 02:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm also one of the co-sponsors and
 
02:30:14.830 --> 02:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams who is the Prime
 
02:30:16.750 --> 02:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill couldn't be with us
 
02:30:20.830 --> 02:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
today so I will just um briefly tell you
 
02:30:22.590 --> 02:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
what happened at the special child care
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
committee we did um do a couple of um
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
fairly minor amendments to the bill one
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
of them maybe Isn't So minor the way the
 
02:30:37.710 --> 02:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill was originally written was that
 
02:30:40.990 --> 02:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
this special child care fund could be
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
used to um make direct payments to
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
childcare employees
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
ye uh for things like the cost of health
 
02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
insurance the cost of
 
02:30:57.870 --> 02:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
um benef benefit type things that they
 
02:31:00.510 --> 02:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
might they might um
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
need what we did in the
 
02:31:07.550 --> 02:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
um special committee was we amended it
 
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
to have these um grants going to the
 
02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
employer and then the employer would
 
02:31:20.269 --> 02:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
work with the employees in um providing
 
02:31:24.070 --> 02:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
incentives for the employees the um
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
major issue behind the bill is to retain
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
our child care
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
Workforce um I'm sure all of you have
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
probably seen articles heard news
 
02:31:40.510 --> 02:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
reports that the child care Workforce is
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
um in in really in Desperate shape um
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
we've we've lost many many employees in
 
02:31:52.469 --> 02:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
that in that area and it's so important
 
02:31:54.990 --> 02:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
because without the child care Workforce
 
02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
you can't have people working in other
 
02:32:02.190 --> 02:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that um are so important to
 
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
this committee because you're the Ways
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee and you're looking
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
for businesses in New Hampshire to um
 
02:32:11.990 --> 02:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
pay their pay their um business
 
02:32:15.429 --> 02:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
taxes um then the only and the only
 
02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
other I I think small amendment that we
 
02:32:21.349 --> 02:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
added was that the Department of Health
 
02:32:24.349 --> 02:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
and Human Services would um develop the
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
rules around this fund there is
 
02:32:27.520 --> 02:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
rules around this fund there is
no

02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation into this fund at this
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
time this is basically a fund being set
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
up in
 
02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
anticipation that in the future there
 
02:32:44.110 --> 02:32:44.120 align:start position:0%
will be funds available for Workforce in
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
the last budget in House Bill 2 there
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
was a $15 million appropriation made to
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
the childcare
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce and if this Bill had been in
 
02:32:59.910 --> 02:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
place it would have gone into that
 
02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:03.800 align:start position:0%
fund um it would go into this fund so in
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
anticipation that in the future there
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
will be um funds available for the child
 
02:33:12.429 --> 02:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
care Workforce this just sets up a fund
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
for how those would be distributed um
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about the
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce at both the state
 
02:33:23.269 --> 02:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
and federal level um anticipating that
 
02:33:25.630 --> 02:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
there will be more funds available to
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
retain and um and encourage people to go
 
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
into the child care um in making Child
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
Care career so
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
um I will just close there and maybe you
 
02:33:41.790 --> 02:33:41.800 align:start position:0%
have questions about
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
it representative PL I read the bill
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
represent walner and I didn't see
 
02:33:50.790 --> 02:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
non-aps anywhere so it is a lapsing fund
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
no dedicated No it should be it should
 
02:33:57.389 --> 02:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
Aly okay
 
02:34:07.950 --> 02:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
right yes representative
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative wner for taking my
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
question um in your work on the
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
commission did you come across existent
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
federal grants that are available for
 
02:34:25.550 --> 02:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
this or is this something we're hoping
 
02:34:28.150 --> 02:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
for in the future I think this is just
 
02:34:31.230 --> 02:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
something no I did not come across any
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
specific Federal money at this point but
 
02:34:36.590 --> 02:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
there is so much talk about the child
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
care Workforce and what's happening not
 
02:34:41.150 --> 02:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
just in New Hampshire but Nationwide it
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
is a very low wage profession and and
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
we're having a really hard time
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
recruiting people to go into this
 
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce and then once we get them
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
there retaining them um so we need to
 
02:34:59.790 --> 02:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
find some ways to encourage people to
 
02:35:02.349 --> 02:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
come to this
 
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce follow up please um the other
 
02:35:13.349 --> 02:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
question I had is um line 27 and line 30
 
02:35:15.269 --> 02:35:15.279 align:start position:0%
talks about child care tuition
 
02:35:15.279 --> 02:35:16.870 align:start position:0%
talks about child care tuition
assistance

02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
um my understanding of that is if a
 
02:35:23.550 --> 02:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
parent were working in child care that
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
it would help pay for their child care
 
02:35:30.309 --> 02:35:30.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um my question is I it
 
02:35:33.150 --> 02:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
does say job related education
 
02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
expenses um I'm
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
wondering how that's characterized if uh
 
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.600 align:start position:0%
if a child care worker were working on a
 
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
degree a ba
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
or associates degree um how would that
 
02:35:57.550 --> 02:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
be is what would job related mean job
 
02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
related I think would mean um there are
 
02:36:02.110 --> 02:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
certain requirements in licensing for
 
02:36:05.349 --> 02:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
what you need um in order to be a child
 
02:36:08.990 --> 02:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
care provider um and then ongoing you
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
have to have so many hours every year of
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
training so I think those job related
 
02:36:16.550 --> 02:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
expenses around that would be would be
 
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
covered as people try to move up a
 
02:36:23.230 --> 02:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
career ladder and maybe go from having
 
02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
just a few college credits in child
 
02:36:27.670 --> 02:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
development maybe they move on to an
 
02:36:30.550 --> 02:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
associates degree um I think that's
 
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
where we really would look to the
 
02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
department to in the promation of rules
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
around how that would be
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
you representa El
 
02:36:52.030 --> 02:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:53.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:36:53.710 --> 02:36:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
this on what is this eligible individual
 
02:37:01.269 --> 02:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
employee because
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
you've Empower owered an eligible
 
02:37:09.429 --> 02:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
individual employee whose employer
 
02:37:13.030 --> 02:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
didn't want to join the program to
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
get on a health saving
 
02:37:19.950 --> 02:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
account insurance all sorts of
 
02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:21.550 align:start position:0%
account insurance all sorts of
things

02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
so this actually and I'm sorry I forgot
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
that this one this actually came up at
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the um special child care committee that
 
02:37:34.830 --> 02:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
part was not in the original Bill and
 
02:37:36.790 --> 02:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
there was some concern among the members
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee that since we uh we're
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to make these um contributions
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
directly to the employe
 
02:37:49.790 --> 02:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
employer there might be some employers
 
02:37:53.110 --> 02:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that might not want
 
02:37:54.990 --> 02:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:37:58.630 --> 02:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
this maybe they didn't feel they had the
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
administrative bandwidth to do it
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
whatever their reason might be they
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
would not do that do it so in order to
 
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
be sure that this would be available to
 
02:38:13.070 --> 02:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
anyone working in the child care field
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
not just those who's their employer
 
02:38:19.110 --> 02:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
chose to do this um that paragraph was
 
02:38:22.349 --> 02:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
added so that it means that that if I
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
worked in a trial care facility that
 
02:38:28.990 --> 02:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
didn't participate in this program as a
 
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
child care professional I could Prof I
 
02:38:34.510 --> 02:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
could apply on my own and I think that
 
02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:35.960 align:start position:0%
that's another place where we would have
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
to promate some rules follow up follow
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
up on I think it's more than rules
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
because on
 
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
this individual
 
02:38:52.309 --> 02:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
employee has to go straight to the
 
02:38:54.349 --> 02:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
department and the department is saying
 
02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
they aren't going to have a
 
02:38:59.269 --> 02:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
cost because it's all going to be put
 
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
off on this uh entity that they pick to
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:10.750 --> 02:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
work I'm sorry I'm just I guess I'm not
 
02:39:18.910 --> 02:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:21.309 --> 02:39:21.319 align:start position:0%
a representative
 
02:39:24.830 --> 02:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
Ames I don't think the fiscal note says
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
that the department will
 
02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
not um incur costs in relationship to
 
02:39:34.990 --> 02:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
processing an employee it says that the
 
02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
costs are indeterminable because they
 
02:39:40.230 --> 02:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't know right uh the number of
 
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
employers who won't participate right
 
02:39:48.429 --> 02:39:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative uh shamberg
 
02:39:53.950 --> 02:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh you mentioned on
 
02:40:00.429 --> 02:40:00.439 align:start position:0%
line uh
 
02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
15 uh grants shall be awarded and then
 
02:40:07.269 --> 02:40:07.279 align:start position:0%
you me mentioned flexible funding on
 
02:40:07.279 --> 02:40:08.710 align:start position:0%
you me mentioned flexible funding on
line

02:40:08.710 --> 02:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
16 for informational purposes what do
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
you see the
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
total Grant uh cost to be for a for an
 
02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:22.670 align:start position:0%
total Grant uh cost to be for a for an
employer

02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
employer
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh what is the cost for child care
 
02:40:28.790 --> 02:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
overall the cost for child care overall
 
02:40:31.190 --> 02:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
o i mean the whole universe of child
 
02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:33.630 align:start position:0%
o i mean the whole universe of child
care

02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:40:37.429 --> 02:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire and I think that we
 
02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
actually have people and that are going
 
02:40:41.030 --> 02:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
to speak after me that can really
 
02:40:42.910 --> 02:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
probably give you that information
 
02:40:45.510 --> 02:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
better than I can but in New Hampshire I
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
I think the what famili is what it's
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
costing for um a preschool child in a
 
02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
child care center probably averages
 
02:40:55.800 --> 02:40:56.670 align:start position:0%
child care center probably averages
about

02:40:56.670 --> 02:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
$115,000 a
 
02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:00.750 align:start position:0%
$115,000 a
year

02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:41:04.550 --> 02:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
babies obviously cost more because the
 
02:41:07.230 --> 02:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
um CH staff child ratio is much
 
02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
different you have to have one staff
 
02:41:10.830 --> 02:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
member for every four
 
02:41:13.550 --> 02:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
babies um for a four-year-old you need
 
02:41:15.710 --> 02:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
one staff member for every thing it's
 
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
every 10 or 12 children so there there's
 
02:41:20.590 --> 02:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
a little bit different cost depending on
 
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:33.389 --> 02:41:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
elme thank you
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
on is there any indication of What
 
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:41.349 align:start position:0%
on is there any indication of What
entity

02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
could would take this
 
02:41:44.439 --> 02:41:46.309 align:start position:0%
could would take this
on

02:41:46.309 --> 02:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
and would it only happen if they found a
 
02:41:52.150 --> 02:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
pocket of money to do
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
it I I think there are um groups that
 
02:41:59.790 --> 02:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
would be capable of taking on a project
 
02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:02.399 align:start position:0%
like this and
 
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't I couldn't
 
02:42:07.950 --> 02:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
specifically say who they are but um I
 
02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
think that there would be would be um
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
groups that would be able to handle this
 
02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:21.550 --> 02:42:21.560 align:start position:0%
um I'll get you a minute I just want to
 
02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
let the committee know I have um six uh
 
02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
more pink cards of from those who want
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
to testify and um well I I've got one
 
02:42:34.510 --> 02:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
more question that actually I think the
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative should be able to answer
 
02:42:41.429 --> 02:42:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh which is you there was 15 million
 
02:42:43.389 --> 02:42:43.399 align:start position:0%
that was put in the budget for child
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
care do you know how it was spent and
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
who spent it yes it it was um
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
appropriated to Health and Human
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
Services it was $1 15 million for the
 
02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
workforce um the Department of Health
 
02:43:01.070 --> 02:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
and Human Services has not um finalized
 
02:43:04.870 --> 02:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
the grants at this point um I believe I
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
don't know whether the department is
 
02:43:10.190 --> 02:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
going to to uh speak today or not but
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
they could probably give you a lot more
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
information about how they we they are
 
02:43:18.750 --> 02:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
in the process but it was a $15 million
 
02:43:20.630 --> 02:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the
 
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
banum so they have time to to get those
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
employers followup follow up is that
 
02:43:35.710 --> 02:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
lapsing no I don't believe it is a
 
02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:37.110 align:start position:0%
lapsing no I don't believe it is a
lapsing

02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
lapsing
 
02:43:41.429 --> 02:43:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:44.230 --> 02:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no more questions thank
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:51.550 --> 02:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
next I have um well and let me just say
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
I've got six pink cards here I think
 
02:43:57.190 --> 02:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
everyone is aware that this policy has
 
02:43:59.990 --> 02:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
passed so we don't need to talk about
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
policy so much I think we understand the
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
need um so our our our Charter here is
 
02:44:08.830 --> 02:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
to focus on on the cost um next I'm
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:22.830 align:start position:0%
 
Stewart

microphone thank you good perfect sorry
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
about that thank you Mr chairman members
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
02:44:32.269 --> 02:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
is Will Stewart and I'm the executive
 
02:44:34.590 --> 02:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
director of stay work play New Hampshire
 
02:44:36.429 --> 02:44:36.439 align:start position:0%
which is a Statewide nonprofit whose
 
02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
mission is to attract and retain more
 
02:44:40.710 --> 02:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
young people here in the granite state
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
which is the second oldest state in the
 
02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
country and certainly don't want to go
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
over all the reasons reasons you know
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
why this is a good idea policy-wise as
 
02:44:51.389 --> 02:44:51.399 align:start position:0%
you mentioned this has been um decided
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
in that regard you know that said I do
 
02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
want to say that you know I think this
 
02:44:57.510 --> 02:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
is you know one of the smartest
 
02:44:59.910 --> 02:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
Investments the state can make uh at
 
02:45:01.349 --> 02:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
State workor play we've been going all
 
02:45:02.950 --> 02:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
around the state you these past couple
 
02:45:04.910 --> 02:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
of months last week we were in the Mount
 
02:45:06.750 --> 02:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley in The Lakes Region
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
tonight we're going to be in do we are
 
02:45:10.110 --> 02:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
hearing about child care everywhere we
 
02:45:13.429 --> 02:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
go uh the expense you know that it uh
 
02:45:15.150 --> 02:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
poses to young families and people who
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
want to start young families if they can
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
even find it um so I won't um you know
 
02:45:21.630 --> 02:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
Rumer too many more of the reasons just
 
02:45:23.510 --> 02:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
want to express our full support for
 
02:45:25.590 --> 02:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and its funding thank you
 
02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
02:45:29.910 --> 02:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
shamberg uh one question thank you for
 
02:45:33.230 --> 02:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question is cost different in
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
different parts of their state here for
 
02:45:38.030 --> 02:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
child care I would leave that uh
 
02:45:40.150 --> 02:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
specific question to some of the experts
 
02:45:42.429 --> 02:45:42.439 align:start position:0%
behind me but uh that certainly seems to
 
02:45:44.550 --> 02:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
be the case anecdotally that I hear but
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's expensive no matter where it seems
 
02:45:48.830 --> 02:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
to be based on the wages that people
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:55.070 --> 02:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
well any other
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
you next I
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:13.070 --> 02:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
Cowell good afternoon how do you do my
 
02:46:15.469 --> 02:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
name is Jackie Cowell I'm the executive
 
02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
director of early learning New Hampshire
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
we are a Statewide nonprofit uh working
 
02:46:22.950 --> 02:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
around Child Care issues here in our
 
02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:26.840 align:start position:0%
state and so um if I may ask a question
 
02:46:29.830 --> 02:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
chairman sure um so I we do have a few
 
02:46:32.070 --> 02:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
people here who've traveled far who just
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
very briefly want to talk about the
 
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
policy they're not experts in the
 
02:46:37.590 --> 02:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
finance of this or the the cost of this
 
02:46:39.630 --> 02:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
would it be okay if they just took a
 
02:46:42.110 --> 02:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
minute or so they they they they're
 
02:46:44.030 --> 02:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're here part of those pink cards
 
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes for the first time and they
 
02:46:47.269 --> 02:46:47.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to answer the question
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
about the financing would it be okay if
 
02:46:51.670 --> 02:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
they still spoke um sure thank you
 
02:46:54.990 --> 02:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that and um so I I know the
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
department is here as well to talk about
 
02:46:59.790 --> 02:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
what they feel is the fiscal impact for
 
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
them the way this was drafted and we we
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
really talked with this is a bipartisan
 
02:47:07.870 --> 02:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
bill as you know um it was a originally
 
02:47:09.790 --> 02:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that passed unan
 
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously as you know out of the house
 
02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
special committee on a bipartisan basis
 
02:47:15.910 --> 02:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
as well and so was really clear that
 
02:47:18.030 --> 02:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
this was the year to establish the fund
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
get it ready as representative walner
 
02:47:22.349 --> 02:47:22.359 align:start position:0%
said perhaps there might be some federal
 
02:47:24.550 --> 02:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
funding coming within the next year
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
before the next banian budget is passed
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so it would be up and running and
 
02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
ready to receive those funds and again
 
02:47:34.349 --> 02:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
it would be understood that there is an
 
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
administrative piece to any federal
 
02:47:38.950 --> 02:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
funds that come that DHHS can use to
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
administer also as we mentioned with the
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
entity The Entity with a contract with
 
02:47:48.429 --> 02:47:48.439 align:start position:0%
bhhs would be able to take whatever um
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
funding is passed next year during the
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget cycle if any the legislature
 
02:47:54.910 --> 02:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
would have its determination when we
 
02:47:56.670 --> 02:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
were talking with Senator Bradley for
 
02:47:58.349 --> 02:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
instance and Senator Innis and a few
 
02:48:00.750 --> 02:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
others they were very clear this is the
 
02:48:02.429 --> 02:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
year to set the fund up to that
 
02:48:05.389 --> 02:48:05.399 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and next year if possible
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
to bring in some um possibilities of
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
some fun of funding for that fund so my
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
hope is again next year when that
 
02:48:15.950 --> 02:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
funding is um determined but it would be
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
there would be a piece of that funding
 
02:48:18.630 --> 02:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
that would automatically go to the
 
02:48:20.389 --> 02:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
administration it wouldn't be an extra
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
cost that would be my thought thank you
 
02:48:26.750 --> 02:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
02:48:28.950 --> 02:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:48:31.950 --> 02:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
you uh next I have a pin card for
 
02:48:35.439 --> 02:48:38.230 align:start position:0%

02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
Maderos hopefully I said that
 
02:48:45.150 --> 02:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
correctly you got it um I will be very
 
02:48:47.550 --> 02:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
brief because um my testimony was mostly
 
02:48:49.870 --> 02:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
focused on policy so I I really do thank
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
you for your time to um hear my story I
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
come from Midstate Health Center we run
 
02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
a child care center that is located in
 
02:48:58.990 --> 02:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
Plymouth New Hampshire so we have just
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
over 60 children and I just want to
 
02:49:03.070 --> 02:49:03.080 align:start position:0%
share this brief story that's just
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
really showcasing why this is so so
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
important um recently one of our infant
 
02:49:10.630 --> 02:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
room teachers has left us she's locating
 
02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
um relocating down South for a better um
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
paying career not in child care um this
 
02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
has caused us to have to prepare some of
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
our families to cut our infant room
 
02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
attendance in half so that's really
 
02:49:25.830 --> 02:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
impacting not just the center's finances
 
02:49:28.349 --> 02:49:28.359 align:start position:0%
to stay open and and pay the rest for
 
02:49:30.750 --> 02:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
staff but also these families who are
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
relying on us for child care um we've
 
02:49:36.630 --> 02:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
struggled immensely to find replacement
 
02:49:39.990 --> 02:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
as you know uh recruiting is challenging
 
02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:42.399 align:start position:0%
but retaining the staff that we can get
 
02:49:45.910 --> 02:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
is extremely important so wage increases
 
02:49:48.429 --> 02:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
um PTO health insurance all of these
 
02:49:52.229 --> 02:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
things are so critically important to um
 
02:49:54.510 --> 02:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that those staff we can get on
 
02:49:56.550 --> 02:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
are are staying with us and taking care
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
of the families in our community um with
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
that I won't go on anymore but I really
 
02:50:03.830 --> 02:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
do thank you for hearing our story thank
 
02:50:06.229 --> 02:50:06.239 align:start position:0%
you do I have any
 
02:50:08.349 --> 02:50:08.359 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:50:11.950 --> 02:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:27.950 --> 02:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
Linette good afternoon and thank you for
 
02:50:29.710 --> 02:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
taking the time to listen to us my name
 
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
is Lyn wette I'm the director in Nellie
 
02:50:34.469 --> 02:50:34.479 align:start position:0%
treehouse in n in amers New Hampshire
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
and I've been in the field of Early
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
Childhood for 41 years um I just want to
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
take an opportunity to um have an
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of why the funds are
 
02:50:47.630 --> 02:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
needed so recently we just released
 
02:50:50.110 --> 02:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
re-registration paperwork and in order
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
to balance giving our staff an annual
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
raise or allowing our parents to be able
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
to pay for their child care um instead
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
of raising our rates to 15% we had to
 
02:51:07.389 --> 02:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
raise them to eight to try to
 
02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
balance um parents can't afford to pay
 
02:51:12.510 --> 02:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
more but these staff deserve to make a
 
02:51:14.950 --> 02:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
living wage they work hard and they're
 
02:51:17.590 --> 02:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
taking care of our youngest citizens who
 
02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
need consistency and love and so having
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
a fund that would allow us to support
 
02:51:25.550 --> 02:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
our staff whether it's through their
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
insurance would be very beneficial not
 
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
just to us but to the families of New
 
02:51:33.389 --> 02:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and I thank you for taking
 
02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
time to listen to us thank you
 
02:51:38.670 --> 02:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative PL partially because my
 
02:51:40.670 --> 02:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
ears are plugged and partially because
 
02:51:43.309 --> 02:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
you were going fast you were director of
 
02:51:45.590 --> 02:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
what Treehouse no Nell's treeh house
 
02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:46.630 align:start position:0%
what Treehouse no Nell's treeh house
Nelly

02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
Nelly
 
02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.950 --> 02:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
you anybody else representative ORS
 
02:51:57.070 --> 02:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
question so how is the money drawn from
 
02:52:02.070 --> 02:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
the fund to pay certain employees and
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
who makes those decisions so at this
 
02:52:06.510 --> 02:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
point that hasn't been decided like
 
02:52:08.670 --> 02:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
Jackie said it's just we are in the
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
process of trying to get this fund set
 
02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
up so we can make those decisions and
 
02:52:16.229 --> 02:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
hopefully work with DH HS to determine
 
02:52:18.389 --> 02:52:18.399 align:start position:0%
what those rules will be and how that
 
02:52:20.630 --> 02:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
fund will go but it will go to the
 
02:52:24.830 --> 02:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
employer to help fund maybe insurance or
 
02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
staff thank you thank
 
02:52:36.389 --> 02:52:36.399 align:start position:0%

02:52:49.750 --> 02:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um my name is Lanna
 
02:52:51.790 --> 02:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
Lorden and I am the chief operating
 
02:52:55.070 --> 02:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
officer at White Bird Center in hener um
 
02:52:57.710 --> 02:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
I've been there for the past 14 years um
 
02:53:02.830 --> 02:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
and have been in every position there um
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate you listening to our
 
02:53:08.790 --> 02:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
stories um specifically mine will speak
 
02:53:12.670 --> 02:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
to the workforce um and my tenure in um
 
02:53:15.309 --> 02:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
the field of early childhood
 
02:53:18.030 --> 02:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
um we all know the pandemic reinforced
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
and deepened public understanding of the
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
essential role of early care and
 
02:53:25.349 --> 02:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
education working families and the
 
02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
economy um and ultimately A system that
 
02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
has been deeply underfunded and
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
undervalued for example in 2019 the
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
median wage for childcare workers in New
 
02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
$169 for preschool teachers the median
 
02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
wage is $144 43 cents and New Hampshire
 
02:53:49.349 --> 02:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
early Educators with a bachelor's degree
 
02:53:50.710 --> 02:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
are paid
 
02:53:54.190 --> 02:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
225% less than their colleagues who work
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
in a K through 8 public um education
 
02:53:57.439 --> 02:53:58.349 align:start position:0%
in a K through 8 public um education
school

02:53:58.349 --> 02:53:58.359 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
system that last statistic has always
 
02:54:03.590 --> 02:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
really resonated with me um not in the
 
02:54:06.910 --> 02:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
best ways um but because I myself hold a
 
02:54:08.349 --> 02:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in elementary
 
02:54:10.790 --> 02:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
education um graduating from college
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
with the hope and dream to be a public
 
02:54:16.229 --> 02:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
school teacher um it's still something
 
02:54:21.950 --> 02:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
that I hold current today um but being
 
02:54:24.830 --> 02:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
um having experienced those lower wages
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
compared to my colleagues um and even
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
more so when I began back in this field
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
in 2010 it was solely because there
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
weren't any District positions available
 
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
I went from teaching um fifth grade in
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
conquered to not having any District
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
positions being available so my starting
 
02:54:45.110 --> 02:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
hourly wage um at White Birch Community
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
Center was
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
$9.75 compared to the $20 per hour that
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
roughly I was making within the public
 
02:54:57.469 --> 02:54:57.479 align:start position:0%
school sector um so I had to settle um
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
or so I so I thought for a toddler
 
02:55:02.510 --> 02:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
classroom teaching position which that
 
02:55:04.269 --> 02:55:04.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity however held the Silver
 
02:55:06.349 --> 02:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
Lining um leading me straight to where I
 
02:55:10.229 --> 02:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
am today um so again this this fund and
 
02:55:15.150 --> 02:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
um this this bill would really sustain
 
02:55:17.790 --> 02:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
the workforce that is incredibly
 
02:55:19.950 --> 02:55:19.960 align:start position:0%
critical for the workforce behind the
 
02:55:22.349 --> 02:55:22.359 align:start position:0%
workforce thank you for your time and
 
02:55:26.030 --> 02:55:26.040 align:start position:0%

members of the committee for hearing Our
 
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
Testimony U my name is Amanda Sears and
 
02:56:44.830 --> 02:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the New Hampshire state director for
 
02:56:46.830 --> 02:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
the campaign for a familyfriendly
 
02:56:49.750 --> 02:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
economy um I will try not to talk about
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
the importance of the policy although
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
that is really hard so I'll try to um
 
02:56:57.590 --> 02:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
stay on some of the um economic reasons
 
02:57:00.550 --> 02:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
um to uh Advance this setup for this
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
policy right now um and I do just want
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit to some of the
 
02:57:05.190 --> 02:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
things we've heard about um
 
02:57:07.870 --> 02:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative wner mentioned that um it
 
02:57:10.590 --> 02:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
is uh very expensive for families to
 
02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
access Child Care at the moment if you
 
02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
have two kids under the age of four
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
right now in the state that's about
 
02:57:19.110 --> 02:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
$25,000 per year just to give you a
 
02:57:22.429 --> 02:57:22.439 align:start position:0%
sense of how expensive that is um you
 
02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
know which for the average working
 
02:57:25.830 --> 02:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
family can be you know half of a
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
person's income or more but for the
 
02:57:29.469 --> 02:57:29.479 align:start position:0%
median person you know and that's just
 
02:57:31.309 --> 02:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
to get out the door and have your kids
 
02:57:32.910 --> 02:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
taken care of for the day so that you
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
can go to work um somebody else
 
02:57:37.110 --> 02:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this Workforce is the
 
02:57:40.190 --> 02:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
workforce behind the workforce um and so
 
02:57:42.670 --> 02:57:42.680 align:start position:0%
every uh person that we have working in
 
02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
child care that that equates to about
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
eight families that can go to work and
 
02:57:49.070 --> 02:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
what is happening right now is that
 
02:57:50.630 --> 02:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
because of the workforce shortage that
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
we have in child care centers across the
 
02:57:55.870 --> 02:57:55.880 align:start position:0%
state almost every Center you speak to
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
will say that they have empty classrooms
 
02:57:59.630 --> 02:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
right now and a weight list that is
 
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:02.200 align:start position:0%
hundreds of kids long and the reason for
 
02:58:04.070 --> 02:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
that is the empty classrooms are of
 
02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
course not because of demand but because
 
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
they can't find staff and every
 
02:58:09.750 --> 02:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
classroom that they have to close means
 
02:58:11.429 --> 02:58:11.439 align:start position:0%
families that then are looking are
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
unable to go to work because they don't
 
02:58:15.110 --> 02:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
have care for their kids or are looking
 
02:58:17.150 --> 02:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
for unsafe places to put their kids
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
because they have to get out the door
 
02:58:20.030 --> 02:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
and go to work and so they end up
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
leaving their kids in situations that
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't otherwise considered to be
 
02:58:27.269 --> 02:58:27.279 align:start position:0%
ideal and so in order to um set up this
 
02:58:29.469 --> 02:58:29.479 align:start position:0%
fund this is you know it's it's really
 
02:58:31.590 --> 02:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh not just about boosting child care
 
02:58:32.990 --> 02:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
but it's about ensuring that every
 
02:58:35.349 --> 02:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
sector in our economy has the workforce
 
02:58:37.550 --> 02:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
that they need um because as I said one
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
person in this sector means eight other
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
people can go to work in the state um
 
02:58:45.150 --> 02:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
the uh speaker before me referenced uh
 
02:58:47.630 --> 02:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
some data about wages and you might see
 
02:58:49.429 --> 02:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
that and I think it was a 2018 or 19
 
02:58:50.870 --> 02:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
number and think oh that's a long time
 
02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
ago it's probably inflated a lot since
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
then I do know that the most recent wage
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
data which is 2022 data is that it was
 
02:59:00.990 --> 02:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
$13.78 that the average child care
 
02:59:04.110 --> 02:59:04.120 align:start position:0%
worker in New Hampshire is making um and
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
if you think about the inflation and
 
02:59:07.750 --> 02:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
wages over the past couple of years in
 
02:59:10.269 --> 02:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
things like retail for example what has
 
02:59:12.229 --> 02:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
happened because Child Care wages have
 
02:59:14.269 --> 02:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
not inflated in the same way is that
 
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
people are leaving child care to go work
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
at Dunkin Donuts or at Target or at
 
02:59:19.870 --> 02:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
Walmart um and are and are really
 
02:59:21.349 --> 02:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
drawing folks away from the the
 
02:59:23.309 --> 02:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
workforce sector and so if you look at
 
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that um the current costs for
 
02:59:28.070 --> 02:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
families are already so high the wages
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
are so low um and they have all that
 
02:59:32.190 --> 02:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
competition that's why this kind of a
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
fund is needed um in terms of setup I
 
02:59:36.950 --> 02:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
know representative you had asked about
 
02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
um the sort of rules and the the
 
02:59:42.030 --> 02:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism for um getting the resources
 
02:59:44.349 --> 02:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
into the hands of employees and I think
 
02:59:46.510 --> 02:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
that while the policy doesn't get into a
 
02:59:48.190 --> 02:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
lot of detail about that I think that
 
02:59:50.630 --> 02:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
there are models in the New Hampshire in
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire policies that can be
 
02:59:55.309 --> 02:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
looked at for that um one for example
 
02:59:57.150 --> 02:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm sort of policy neutral about
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
what these different policies are but
 
03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
just in terms of mechanism um you know
 
03:00:02.510 --> 03:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
the voucher system for example that's
 
03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
used in public in um in education for uh
 
03:00:08.830 --> 03:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
school-aged kids um you know that system
 
03:00:10.510 --> 03:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
is one system where resources are
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
getting out to individual families um
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
who choose to do something other than
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
the public school sector so there are um
 
03:00:19.950 --> 03:00:19.960 align:start position:0%
models that you can look at in New
 
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire policy for this kind of um uh
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
sort of Quasi or separate from
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
governmental but you know like a a
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
system where there is a fund
 
03:00:30.670 --> 03:00:30.680 align:start position:0%
administrator that administers getting
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
funds out um to uh individuals for um
 
03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
for resources you know like this so I
 
03:00:39.349 --> 03:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to if you believe
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
that there is more definition needed at
 
03:00:42.990 --> 03:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
this stage in the policy I think there's
 
03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
places you could look for for that thank
 
03:00:46.030 --> 03:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
you yes representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:00:51.790 --> 03:00:51.800 align:start position:0%
chair so thanks for taking my question
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so how much are you hoping to raise
 
03:00:58.030 --> 03:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
the hourly rate for these individuals by
 
03:01:00.510 --> 03:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
through the fund yeah um that's a good
 
03:01:02.349 --> 03:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
question and thank you um you know
 
03:01:05.309 --> 03:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
honestly and enough to be competitive is
 
03:01:08.229 --> 03:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
the best answer I can give um I I've
 
03:01:10.830 --> 03:01:10.840 align:start position:0%
neglected to say but in um Maine and
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont last year in 2023 both of those
 
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
States passed policies to inject
 
03:01:19.429 --> 03:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
resources um into uh wages for their
 
03:01:21.309 --> 03:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
childcare workforces and Massachusetts
 
03:01:24.110 --> 03:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
already had and so um and you know that
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
the length of our borders means that if
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
having all three of those states have um
 
03:01:31.830 --> 03:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh boosts to the workforce uh resources
 
03:01:33.710 --> 03:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to be competitive
 
03:01:35.070 --> 03:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
with those States so that people don't
 
03:01:36.670 --> 03:01:36.680 align:start position:0%
just go across the border and work there
 
03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is what's happening now the people
 
03:01:39.710 --> 03:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
that are that want to stay in the sector
 
03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
but feel like they can't afford to in
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are going across the
 
03:01:44.030 --> 03:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
border and so I think that we need to
 
03:01:46.269 --> 03:01:46.279 align:start position:0%
look at um making sure that we can raise
 
03:01:47.710 --> 03:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
rates to be competitive with those
 
03:01:50.710 --> 03:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
States and I think that you know um I
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
believe $5 is sort of the um an extra
 
03:01:57.469 --> 03:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
five dollar you know um an hour is what
 
03:01:58.750 --> 03:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
would make us competitive with those
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
States um because we are so far behind
 
03:02:02.950 --> 03:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:02:06.269 --> 03:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
followup follow up yeah so I I would say
 
03:02:08.269 --> 03:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
your analysis is correct because I'm
 
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
thinking where I live in
 
03:02:13.389 --> 03:02:13.399 align:start position:0%
chiester route nine that goes through
 
03:02:13.399 --> 03:02:14.190 align:start position:0%
chiester route nine that goes through
the

03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
I mean McDonald's The Weather Vein they
 
03:02:19.429 --> 03:02:19.439 align:start position:0%
they're advertising $18 an hour so I'm
 
03:02:21.429 --> 03:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to what you're right you
 
03:02:22.990 --> 03:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
know you're trying to do is just I don't
 
03:02:25.150 --> 03:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
know how you really solve it maybe this
 
03:02:26.630 --> 03:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
is an answer
 
03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
but those kind of jobs are you know who
 
03:02:31.190 --> 03:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
needs minimum wage when they're paying
 
03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:33.399 align:start position:0%
$18 an hour and here you folks are
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
trying to raise it tough situation so
 
03:02:38.349 --> 03:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to what you're trying
 
03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
to do I thank you thank you thank you um
 
03:02:44.710 --> 03:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
I think if there's no more questions uh
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from D HHS next thank you
 
03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:59.510 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from D HHS next thank you
very

03:02:59.510 --> 03:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.229 --> 03:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh I'm Brian Clark uh
 
03:03:04.830 --> 03:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
general counsel for the division of
 
03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
economic stability on behalf of DHHS I
 
03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
have with me Jesse Davis and I am the
 
03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
bureau chief of Child Development and
 
03:03:15.229 --> 03:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
headart cl collaboration for
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
DHHS thank you very much and I'll ask
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
you both when you're done just fill out
 
03:03:19.990 --> 03:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
a pink
 
03:03:26.150 --> 03:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.550 --> 03:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
great um so I don't know if you guys
 
03:03:31.229 --> 03:03:31.239 align:start position:0%
want to say something or or you want
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
questions did you have some initial
 
03:03:35.150 --> 03:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
statements or well I guess I would just
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
say we're here to answer questions about
 
03:03:39.910 --> 03:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
the cost um ultimately we couldn't
 
03:03:42.429 --> 03:03:42.439 align:start position:0%
determine what the cost would be a
 
03:03:44.950 --> 03:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
general rule of thumb that we use in
 
03:03:46.710 --> 03:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
estimating the cost of administering
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
funds like this is
 
03:03:50.910 --> 03:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
10% um but since there's no
 
03:03:53.229 --> 03:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation or identified funding we
 
03:03:55.510 --> 03:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't really give you a number but
 
03:03:57.870 --> 03:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
we're available for questions okay thank
 
03:03:59.630 --> 03:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:04:02.670 --> 03:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you um I was just doing
 
03:04:04.750 --> 03:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
some quick research while the previous
 
03:04:07.349 --> 03:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
speakers were speaking and it seems
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
like the federal government is
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
increasing the block grants um to the
 
03:04:15.510 --> 03:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
states lately but my assumption is that
 
03:04:17.550 --> 03:04:17.560 align:start position:0%
that most of the block grants that we
 
03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
get um it looks like the kind of thing
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
that supports um families low-income
 
03:04:28.349 --> 03:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
families can get a subsidy um from the
 
03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
Department of from DHHS to send their
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
kids which provides some stability to
 
03:04:38.990 --> 03:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
the daycare that's accepting right and
 
03:04:41.349 --> 03:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
some stability to the families but it
 
03:04:43.309 --> 03:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
seems like the approach here is a little
 
03:04:46.269 --> 03:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit different supporting the
 
03:04:49.990 --> 03:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
daycare provider directly to be able to
 
03:04:54.030 --> 03:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
support their employees um to keep their
 
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um education up to date to grow their
 
03:05:00.910 --> 03:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
education so am I right is or does it
 
03:05:03.670 --> 03:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
look like there might be another source
 
03:05:04.910 --> 03:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
of federal
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
funding um that could go
 
03:05:07.520 --> 03:05:09.269 align:start position:0%
funding um that could go
into

03:05:09.269 --> 03:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
into
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh an account such as the one we're
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
trying to establish thank
 
03:05:18.710 --> 03:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
you so um there are opportunities
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
through the ccdf funding um to support
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
the workforce um the majority of the
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
funding goes as you said to eligible
 
03:05:31.269 --> 03:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
families who are lowincome and require
 
03:05:33.630 --> 03:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
subsidy to be able to afford the cost of
 
03:05:36.349 --> 03:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
care so that's a really complex question
 
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
if they put more dollars into the ccdf
 
03:05:41.670 --> 03:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
fund that may expand eligibility for
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
low-income families but it doesn't
 
03:05:47.070 --> 03:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily increase the cost to the
 
03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
Child Care Program for that slot there's
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
been a couple of questions about the
 
03:05:54.429 --> 03:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
cost of care and that's a really
 
03:05:56.830 --> 03:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
challenging question to answer
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
nationally and part of that is because
 
03:06:02.429 --> 03:06:02.439 align:start position:0%
families cannot afford the true cost of
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
care and so Child Care programs are
 
03:06:07.070 --> 03:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
charging much less in order to be able
 
03:06:10.229 --> 03:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
to have families have access to Services
 
03:06:12.229 --> 03:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
um this year is the first year that a
 
03:06:14.790 --> 03:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
narrow cost analys is is required by the
 
03:06:17.269 --> 03:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
federal government to get closer to that
 
03:06:19.229 --> 03:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
number so that we can understand the
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
cost of care so this is very complex um
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
I did have a meeting with the Senator's
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
office last week talking about the
 
03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
specific issue of the federal government
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
needing to call out the childcare
 
03:06:33.070 --> 03:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce more
 
03:06:36.910 --> 03:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
specifically um but at this time there
 
03:06:40.269 --> 03:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
are no federal dollars specifically
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the child care Workforce
 
03:06:44.399 --> 03:06:46.030 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the child care Workforce
thank

03:06:46.030 --> 03:06:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:06:48.830 --> 03:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
you yes representative shamberg followed
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
by represent okay represent
 
03:06:54.229 --> 03:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
oling I thank you thank you
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
representative chamber um on your fiscal
 
03:06:59.830 --> 03:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
note it indicates on the under the
 
03:07:01.790 --> 03:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
question does this bill provide
 
03:07:04.750 --> 03:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient funding to cover estimated
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures but you don't know what the
 
03:07:09.630 --> 03:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditures are so you mark
 
03:07:09.640 --> 03:07:12.110 align:start position:0%
estimated expenditures are so you mark
this

03:07:12.110 --> 03:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:13.630 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:07:13.630 --> 03:07:13.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
what type of
 
03:07:18.429 --> 03:07:18.439 align:start position:0%
expenditures would you anticipate
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
if say $10 came in from uh Monopoly
 
03:07:25.229 --> 03:07:25.239 align:start position:0%
money from the federal
 
03:07:28.349 --> 03:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
government well so the expenditures
 
03:07:29.389 --> 03:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:07:33.309 --> 03:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
to um contract with a designated entity
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
to administer the
 
03:07:39.190 --> 03:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
fund um that's going to be what the
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:49.950 --> 03:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
and what requirements would this entity
 
03:07:51.710 --> 03:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
have you'd have to go through the that
 
03:07:54.349 --> 03:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
process what would the time commitment
 
03:07:57.469 --> 03:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
be to set up the rules and of as to
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
who's going to be providing it how it's
 
03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
going to be provided how it's going to
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
be administered what what is the time
 
03:08:06.309 --> 03:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
commitment for that do you have an
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
estimate of that so Ru making would take
 
03:08:11.550 --> 03:08:11.560 align:start position:0%
several months the bill is supposed to
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
be effective January 1st 2025 so uh the
 
03:08:17.950 --> 03:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
if the bill passes quickly and there's
 
03:08:19.750 --> 03:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
funding available we will start right
 
03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
away uh but six months for rule making
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
aent follow
 
03:08:33.070 --> 03:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
up if funding is available yes and if
 
03:08:35.150 --> 03:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
funding is not available we have a
 
03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund with no money in it that
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
does nothing
 
03:08:43.150 --> 03:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative shamberg all about by
 
03:08:45.429 --> 03:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
representative duet yes I guess thank
 
03:08:46.870 --> 03:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question thank you Mr
 
03:08:49.229 --> 03:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess my question to the
 
03:08:49.239 --> 03:08:50.950 align:start position:0%
chairman I guess my question to the
department

03:08:50.950 --> 03:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:08:54.110 --> 03:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
is why are all these administered by
 
03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:55.590 align:start position:0%
is why are all these administered by
third

03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
third
 
03:08:59.469 --> 03:08:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:59.479 --> 03:09:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
internally

03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
internally
 
03:09:04.750 --> 03:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
um well the bill before us is
 
03:09:06.990 --> 03:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
specifically says that the department
 
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
will designate a third party uh the
 
03:09:11.710 --> 03:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
initial draft did have the department
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
administering the funds
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
um so the reason it says that is because
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
the committee drafted it that
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
way representative
 
03:09:26.750 --> 03:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
duet thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I we heard some
 
03:09:32.309 --> 03:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
testimony there was some $15 million
 
03:09:35.309 --> 03:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
that uh the department received last
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
year is this going to leave a void if
 
03:09:39.830 --> 03:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
and we also heard testimony that those
 
03:09:43.630 --> 03:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
$15 million would if this fund was
 
03:09:45.790 --> 03:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
established would be shifted over there
 
03:09:47.950 --> 03:09:47.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm wondering whether it's going
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
to leave a void 15 million was spent on
 
03:09:54.429 --> 03:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
something and I know it wasn't some of
 
03:09:56.269 --> 03:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
these I'm guessing it's not one of these
 
03:09:57.630 --> 03:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
specifics that are laid out in this
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and how are you
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to back fill that Gap with those
 
03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
dollars that you received so the15
 
03:10:10.590 --> 03:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
million appropriation we are calling the
 
03:10:13.190 --> 03:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
childcare Workforce Grant that
 
03:10:16.030 --> 03:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
application period closed February 23rd
 
03:10:17.710 --> 03:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
and the department is going through
 
03:10:19.630 --> 03:10:19.640 align:start position:0%
applications in that process right now
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
and many of the same um expenses can be
 
03:10:25.790 --> 03:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
used um that are written in this bill
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
for that funding as well um by the time
 
03:10:31.550 --> 03:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
this fund got
 
03:10:34.750 --> 03:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations allocated to it that 15
 
03:10:39.550 --> 03:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
million would be expended follow up so I
 
03:10:41.710 --> 03:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
I probably misunderstood so it's a
 
03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative Le Lee thank you Mr
 
03:10:55.269 --> 03:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking a question
 
03:10:55.279 --> 03:10:57.309 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking a question
um

03:10:57.309 --> 03:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:00.670 --> 03:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
are I'm assuming that you're reviewing
 
03:11:02.630 --> 03:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
applications but you already have
 
03:11:05.309 --> 03:11:05.319 align:start position:0%
parameters of of what you think are
 
03:11:08.630 --> 03:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate um ways to spend that money
 
03:11:11.110 --> 03:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
um does it do some of those overlap with
 
03:11:13.550 --> 03:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing here or are they
 
03:11:15.309 --> 03:11:15.319 align:start position:0%
different and can you kind of enumerate
 
03:11:17.550 --> 03:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
some of those just so we can understand
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
um differences and overlaps and then
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
another question is it sounds like
 
03:11:26.070 --> 03:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
you're administering the $15
 
03:11:28.990 --> 03:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
million the department is administering
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the $15 million and unfortunately I did
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
not come prepared with all of the ways
 
03:11:35.950 --> 03:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
that you can spend the current Grant
 
03:11:39.750 --> 03:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
dollars but they are very similar and um
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
we will know um J July 2024 is the first
 
03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
reporting period on the $15 million
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
funds to know how those um funds were
 
03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
used for those programs so we at this
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:04.030 --> 03:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
share represent me yeah thank you
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I've got two things but on one of
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
them is on this so I want to stay on it
 
03:12:16.190 --> 03:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
on there is no way that you are allowed
 
03:12:19.950 --> 03:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
to use part of this 15 million to get
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
the rules written so that you can start
 
03:12:30.070 --> 03:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
correct so you aren't going to do it
 
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.229 --> 03:12:43.239 align:start position:0%
money if this bill passes I believe that
 
03:12:46.070 --> 03:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
then we would have to solve the problem
 
03:12:49.469 --> 03:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
of getting the rules written and how we
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
would administer the program whether it
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
would be with a third party entity
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
whether it would be the department I
 
03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question specifically
 
03:13:01.510 --> 03:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
at this
 
03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:03.590 align:start position:0%
at this
time

03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:13:06.670 --> 03:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple of things in this
 
03:13:09.389 --> 03:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
bill that you
 
03:13:14.590 --> 03:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
you or just said you didn't want might
 
03:13:21.910 --> 03:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
not want to do but they're in the bills
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to if we passed it one of
 
03:13:27.910 --> 03:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
them is that
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
on handing it over to an independent
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
entity and the other one is this
 
03:13:40.229 --> 03:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
business about an eligible individual
 
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
employee uh that that can't get his
 
03:13:49.150 --> 03:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
employer to do it and you
 
03:13:54.030 --> 03:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:58.590 --> 03:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh on you would have to work directly
 
03:14:02.030 --> 03:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
with these eligible individual
 
03:14:04.670 --> 03:14:04.680 align:start position:0%
employees and it looks like it would
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
have to be outside of that other
 
03:14:07.680 --> 03:14:09.670 align:start position:0%
have to be outside of that other
designated

03:14:09.670 --> 03:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
designated
 
03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
entity so um I'm not quite sure how that
 
03:14:17.030 --> 03:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
one works and whether you would want us
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
to change some of the
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
language or how can we make sure that
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
this thing can get
 
03:14:28.830 --> 03:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
done um yes that's correct so when I
 
03:14:31.030 --> 03:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
read that I was my understanding was
 
03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
that if an eligible employee applied for
 
03:14:38.190 --> 03:14:38.200 align:start position:0%
funding to do um let's say tuition
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
assistance for professional education
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
and the employer didn't want participate
 
03:14:46.190 --> 03:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
for some reason um the employee could
 
03:14:48.349 --> 03:14:48.359 align:start position:0%
apply directly to the department instead
 
03:14:52.469 --> 03:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
of the designated entity uh for funding
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
and so the impact of that is really too
 
03:15:00.469 --> 03:15:00.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to determine um we we could do
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
it uh we would need to write
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rules on how you apply um
 
03:15:08.870 --> 03:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
where the funding how we would be able
 
03:15:14.190 --> 03:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
to draw down from that um
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
but we're not sure what percentage of
 
03:15:21.950 --> 03:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
any follow up thank you do you have some
 
03:15:30.110 --> 03:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
idea of what the
 
03:15:33.309 --> 03:15:33.319 align:start position:0%
um the difficulties might be for
 
03:15:37.990 --> 03:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
instance let's take all of the um
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
garages in New
 
03:15:45.389 --> 03:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on most of of them are are
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
three to six employees I think maybe
 
03:15:50.150 --> 03:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
they go up to
 
03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
10 and that could
 
03:15:57.429 --> 03:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
be a lot of bureaucratic work for them
 
03:15:59.590 --> 03:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
that they aren't really equipped to
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
handle of course only one or two
 
03:16:06.269 --> 03:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
kids so um but that's a lot of
 
03:16:15.030 --> 03:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who could apply as I
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
understand it as an
 
03:16:17.439 --> 03:16:19.229 align:start position:0%
understand it as an
individual

03:16:19.229 --> 03:16:19.239 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:16:25.670 --> 03:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.469 --> 03:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
them I'm I'm unsure of the question but
 
03:16:32.790 --> 03:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
yes there are some complexities in this
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill that um would need to have careful
 
03:16:40.510 --> 03:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
consideration during Ru making um I
 
03:16:42.830 --> 03:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
think that I I was ask the special
 
03:16:44.750 --> 03:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee on child care when they added
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
that it it went over about an hour um
 
03:16:52.510 --> 03:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the intent of this bill is
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
to really support the
 
03:16:54.359 --> 03:16:56.349 align:start position:0%
to really support the
workforce

03:16:56.349 --> 03:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
03:16:58.269 --> 03:16:58.279 align:start position:0%
and if an
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
employer did not want to opt into this
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity they didn't want the
 
03:17:08.429 --> 03:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
employees to not have that benefit and
 
03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
so this was the way that they were
 
03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
trying to um ensure that the child care
 
03:17:17.670 --> 03:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
workers had access to this
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
fund yes but could you handle
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
it I will say that we would need more
 
03:17:28.750 --> 03:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
employees for the complexity
 
03:17:37.510 --> 03:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.429 --> 03:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
fund who represent spilburg
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
am I correctly understanding that the
 
03:17:45.550 --> 03:17:45.560 align:start position:0%
only employers we're talking about here
 
03:17:50.349 --> 03:17:50.359 align:start position:0%
who can apply are daycare employers
 
03:17:52.349 --> 03:17:52.359 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about employers around
 
03:17:56.349 --> 03:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
the economy or employers of people who
 
03:17:58.229 --> 03:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
have children in daycare we're talking
 
03:18:03.189 --> 03:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
about people who employ daycare
 
03:18:06.790 --> 03:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
workers yes so um it says Child Care
 
03:18:08.910 --> 03:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
programs operating with an Active Child
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
Care license or that are license exempt
 
03:18:13.710 --> 03:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
and enrolled in the Department of Health
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
and Human Services child care
 
03:18:17.790 --> 03:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship program that's about 600
 
03:18:20.590 --> 03:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
programs out of the 700ish that are in
 
03:18:20.600 --> 03:18:25.189 align:start position:0%
programs out of the 700ish that are in
New

03:18:25.189 --> 03:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:28.670 --> 03:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire repres fellows thank you Mr
 
03:18:32.710 --> 03:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just wondering if um the since
 
03:18:35.670 --> 03:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
the source of funds for this could be
 
03:18:38.910 --> 03:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
any private state or federal
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
money that maybe you're what it can be
 
03:18:46.349 --> 03:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
used for needs to include some kind of
 
03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
flexibility to it because you know a
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
private donation or federal federal
 
03:18:53.750 --> 03:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
money you don't they're going to tell
 
03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
you they're going to tell you how they
 
03:18:58.670 --> 03:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
think the money ought to be spent and
 
03:19:02.790 --> 03:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
and my the other question is when money
 
03:19:05.229 --> 03:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
comes in from federal and private
 
03:19:09.710 --> 03:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
sources is it going to be clear when it
 
03:19:12.990 --> 03:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
should go into this fund versus versus
 
03:19:15.309 --> 03:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
maybe some other programs you already
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
have at your agency related to child
 
03:19:24.429 --> 03:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
care So currently for the workforce we
 
03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
really only have
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
one funding stream that is not um
 
03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
Affiliated from the state and so uh
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
that's somewhat of a complex question
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
for me to answer um because I didn't
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
write this bill but I assume that that
 
03:19:47.309 --> 03:19:47.319 align:start position:0%
the anybody any private donor investing
 
03:19:49.630 --> 03:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
money in this fund would understand that
 
03:19:51.550 --> 03:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
it would go to the childcare Workforce
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
reasons seeing no more questions thank
 
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.670 --> 03:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
much is there anyone else who would like
 
03:20:13.030 --> 03:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
to testify on hb1 1611
 
03:20:14.670 --> 03:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:18.630 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
public

03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.590 --> 03:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
hearing so um thank you everyone that
 
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
that concludes today's uh agenda
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow as you know we are meeting
 
03:20:29.950 --> 03:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
starting at 9:30 we have a work session
 
03:20:32.590 --> 03:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
and then at 1:00 uh no
