e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:58.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:28.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:45.149 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:11.949 align:start position:0%
 
too

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
so we'll open the work session we have a
 
00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
number of things we hope to get through
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
today I know there's some amendments
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
that representa Maguire yeah has already
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
informed me of
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so we have
 
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
one5 and 38 18 and Senate Bill
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
252 uh kind of rolled into one here and
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
what Melissa and Mike have put together
 
00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 align:start position:0%
comparison I've been talking to Chairman
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
Roy and some of the ranking member of
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
the Democrats on the criminal justice
 
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee and they saw the advantages of
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
rolling uh all of these bills into one
 
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
because there were some competing issues
 
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
as far as Financial impacts things
 
00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
didn't line up well representative
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
Maguire has asked that maybe we go
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
through this line by line uh and he's
 
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
got some other things he' like to
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
discuss does everybody have a copy of
 
00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.949 align:start position:0%
discuss does everybody have a copy of
this

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
this
comparison

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
of so represent Maguire you would like
 
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 align:start position:0%
to discuss this further so here's the
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
thing I I understand why representative
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
Roy and the others think of this as one
 
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
big package all right it's it's clear
 
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
when you look at the underlying changes
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
how they fit together sort of like a
 
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639 align:start position:0%
puzzle and I'd like to but I but some of
 
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 align:start position:0%
them are costly changes right the
 
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 align:start position:0%
magistrates in particular I think the
 
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is well over $2 million a
 
00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
year um and then the so the question is
 
00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
like our question always is are we
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
getting value for money right what are
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
we gaining by having this versus what we
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
have have now so I put on this little
 
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.070 align:start position:0%
have have now so I put on this little
chart

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.749 align:start position:0%
chart
here

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:04.759 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 align:start position:0%
um oh this Springs
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
memories okay what do we have now in in
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
terms of the the big in terms of the big
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
issues right I think we if we can come
 
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
to agreement on the big stuff then the
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
line by line will go Fairly smoothly or
 
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
or maybe we LBA can do it themselves but
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
so what do we have now we have bail
 
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and judges right bail
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
Commissioners there's 95 of them they
 
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
work for $40 they're only paid maybe 50
 
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
to to 80% of the time depending on which
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
one and what district and things like
 
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
that um they typically only do PR bail
 
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail they often
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't ask for cash bail although some
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
may and we're told that some of them are
 
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
ill Tred right so they're they're not
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
always making the best decision all
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
right the judges on the other hand only
 
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
work Monday through Friday they do do
 
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 align:start position:0%
both per PR bail and cash bail okay um
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then the monitoring issue so one of
 
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
these things is the ankle bracelets some
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
counties not all do ankle bracelet
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
monitoring their costs are roughly $30 a
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
week because they all rent these these U
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
ankle bracelets from some service
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
company and then they charge for it um
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'm told that marac County just charges
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
the $33 they pay straford County charges
 
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 align:start position:0%
$100 I chair I talked to the
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
Commissioners about this and I talked to
 
00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.710 align:start position:0%
Commissioners about this and I talked to
the

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
the and and one of the things is the
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
reason why they charge $100 because the
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
bracelet cost $30 but there's also
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
monitoring involved sure and there's a
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of monitoring
 
00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
involved and that's why straford
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
County's program has been so successful
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
their true cost is closer to $100 no
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
there's very very little profit if any
 
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 align:start position:0%
profit there in fact it actually may
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
still be a loss but they charge $100 to
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
cover the entire cost of the bracelet
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
and yeah and but my understanding is
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
marac county has five employees who are
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
authorized to see the the pings right
 
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
and and that's just they consider that
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
part of their you know their overhead or
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
something anyway they don't charge for
 
00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
that part okay um so that's going on
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
with the monitoring now we also have
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
have no information system that allows
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
anybody to know who's on bail at any
 
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:38.919 align:start position:0%
given time all right the way it works is
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner fills out a piece
 
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
of paper saying I let someone you know
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
Joe Smith go on bail um he's supposed to
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
show up at court on Thursday and he
 
00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
gives that piece of paper to the court
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
sometime the following week and the
 
00:07:57.149 --> 00:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
court takes a picture of that piece of
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
paper and sticks it in Joe Smith's file
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
okay so then when the court meets they
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
know that Joe Smith is supposed to be
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
there maybe he's there maybe he's not
 
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
and so on but but the piece of paper is
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
never sort of typed in so that nobody
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
and you know if Joe Smith gets picked up
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
halfway across the state nobody knows it
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
right because it's it's it's scanned on
 
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper in some file it's it's
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
not it's not in a system so that you can
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
search and and say oh this guy's out on
 
00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
bail so um and I think part of the other
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is the the court so
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
the paper doesn't get into the court
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
system for days and even when it's there
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
the police and so on are not don't have
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
access to that system so all right so
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's it nobody knows when somebody's
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
on on bail and then secondly finally um
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
the the law requires that um cases be
 
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
seen by a judge judge or somebody uh
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
within 48 hours after the person's
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
arrest and weekends and holidays don't
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
count all right so right now somebody
 
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
could be arrested on a Friday the
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
weekend doesn't count they don't see a
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
judge till Tuesday so they're sitting in
 
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
jail after being arrested okay for for
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
multiple days okay all right what these
 
00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
multiple days okay all right what these
bills

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
do for bail Commissioners it changes the
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
$40 to
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
$50 it makes it guaranteed it's going to
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
be the $50 is going to be paid by the
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
court to the bail commissioner and then
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
the court will later collect it from the
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
person so there's some expense here I
 
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
think our Mike our fiscal note is under
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
a million or something for the number
 
00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
you know the dead beats that won't be
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
paying this and we'll have to eat
 
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
it I I think it's the number I in the
 
00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839 align:start position:0%
back of my mind is about 800,000 maybe
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
for that I don't I don't know if it's
 
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
but that's the total
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
cost so the bail fee for $40 is
 
00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
$850 and for 50 it's around a million oh
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
but 80% of that's going to or some
 
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
fraction of that's going to be
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursed by the people or not or is
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
this just the part
 
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's unreimbursed right okay so call
 
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
this this this part is a million doll
 
00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:37.399 align:start position:0%
cost but everybody seems to agree that
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
I've talked to that that's Justified
 
00:10:42.509 --> 00:10:42.519 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that is a significant
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
cost um they're going to have training
 
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
all right in in one of these bills uh
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
it's the chief magistrate who's going to
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
be doing the training but in in House
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 105 we're creating a training
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
coordinator so one of my amendments is
 
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
have that training done by the training
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
coordinator okay um and these bills give
 
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:10.680 align:start position:0%
the bail Commissioners fewer cases
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
because it takes a certain list of of
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
serious cases away from the bail
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Al together and gives them
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
to the magistrates okay so it's it's
 
00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:23.079 align:start position:0%
like murder
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
and first and second degree assault and
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
certain other serious cases okay um
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
all right the Bill calls for 15
 
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
magistrates scattered around the state
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
they will work weekends and they can do
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
all cases right so all these cases that
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
are going away from bail Commissioners
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
would go to these magistrates on the
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
weekends and during the week presumably
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
they would go to judges okay all right
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
judges no change essentially right they
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
they do all cases Monday through
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
Friday um the monitoring Point P portion
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
of these bills says the courts are going
 
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
to do the monitoring okay to to me that
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense it's the counties
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
that should have the responsibility and
 
00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
I believe these bills don't allocate any
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
money to this when clearly there's
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's money involved so um where do
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
you get the magistrates all cases I
 
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:22.160 align:start position:0%
don't think you're correct well bail
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are still going to do the
 
00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are still going to do the
non

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
non
 
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.509 align:start position:0%
non
felony

00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
felony
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
arrests no I
 
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:32.199 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner is is allowed to do
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
all cases in the same way a judge is
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
magist a magistrate I mean a magistrate
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
so is that your question because because
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
well you just have magistrates all cases
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
well that's not quite I don't mean they
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
will do all cases I mean they can do all
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
cases they can do all case types all
 
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
case because the legislation has I think
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
six or seven categories that require the
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
magistrates to no longer bail
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to handle those more
 
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.550 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to handle those more
serious

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
serious
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
cases that's right so my my point was
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
case types right so so they're
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
authorized just like a judge to to do
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
cases that that the bail commission is
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
still will be working weekends that's I
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be clear they'll handle all the
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
non absolutely the bail Commissioners in
 
00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
the new model are not going away they're
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%
still there they'll still handle
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
presumably 80% of the cases or some some
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
large number of cases okay all right um
 
00:13:41.189 --> 00:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
then there's $1.7 million to to buy the
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
system to give us information about bail
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
okay personally I I have an argument why
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is way too much money but we'll
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
talk about that in a minute and now this
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
is the key part that makes it more
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
expensive is right now cases P people
 
00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
who are accused can be in jail for days
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
before going before a judge um the new
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
requirement is cases must be heard
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours and so this is the key
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
thing that causes the magistrates right
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
because number one we're taking cases
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
away from bail Commissioners number two
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
um we're we so therefore we need
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
somebody to act within 24 hours
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
and the judges are still not working
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
weekends right so therefore you need
 
00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
magistrates that that's why this whole
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
thing is kind of a package from from the
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
point of view of chairman Roy Etc right
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
it's this part that causes that part
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay and this part is
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
expensive um now
 
00:14:54.199 --> 00:14:56.110 align:start position:0%
expensive um now
so

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:58.680 align:start position:0%
so any question let's let's say any
 
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
questions on what we do now versus
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
bills represent
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
grassie I just have one one one question
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe comment um is that you're
 
00:15:16.509 --> 00:15:16.519 align:start position:0%
saying as far as holding for 24 hours
 
00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:18.519 align:start position:0%
and they have to have a bail hearing
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
before within 24 hours or or currently
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
they're being held for as much as 48
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
Hours more than that plus weekend if we
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
if you hold them for 40 hours that's a
 
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
cost that the counties are in curing
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
that we don't see if they get if they're
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
done within 24 hours that alleviates a
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
cost to the county so it would be a
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
savings to the local taxpayers but it's
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
a cost that the state would have to pick
 
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
up I think that could very well be true
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
so you know is there a direct tradeoff
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
there that the amount of money that
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
we're saving at the local level the
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
state is picking up or is it an
 
00:15:49.389 --> 00:15:49.399 align:start position:0%
additional cost that the state is
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
picking up by doing this which is the
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
more costeffective is a question I have
 
00:15:54.749 --> 00:15:54.759 align:start position:0%
to ask and I don't know if we have that
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
information or we'd be able to to know
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
what that information is which be
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
holding somebody for 48 hours or getting
 
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
them out and processed within 24 and I
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
don't know in in in the serious cases
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here whether
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
um they they frequently get out on bail
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
or you know what I mean nobody gets out
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
on bail and murd as what I understand or
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
essentially nobody but but maybe for you
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
know CL um assault level two or
 
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
something they do you know I don't know
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
hello Erin krian general counsel for the
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I just quickly wanted to
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
mention that a bail commissioner can
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
bail someone on anything that is not
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
murder a life in prison offense or a
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
violation of a protective order and a
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
stalking abuse and neglect or domestic
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
violence case um so those are not
 
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
offenses where bail is very common um
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
and the numbers of course of murders and
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
life offenses in New Hampshire is
 
00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:53.550 align:start position:0%
life offenses in New Hampshire is
relatively

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
low all
 
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
low all
right

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
so if we want to so so the part of this
 
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:09.640 align:start position:0%
that to me seems least valuable okay um
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
aside from the 1.7 million which I think
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
could be done with 200,000 okay where
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
are you getting that number from okay
 
00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you you want let's talk about
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
this okay so um I'm a former software
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
development manager all right so I know
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
something about writing software and
 
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:31.640 align:start position:0%
specifying it and so on so I went to
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
someone I know is capable and and wrote
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
a spec for for an online system that
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
would do exactly this something that the
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners the police the judges
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
the clerks everybody could have a secure
 
00:17:48.789 --> 00:17:48.799 align:start position:0%
password into that would create a file
 
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
for each person that's that's in the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
system that would have information about
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
they were arrested on such and such a
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
time they were bailed on such and such a
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
time and and so on would have their
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
photograph in it all that kind of stuff
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
so I went to somebody who's capable of
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
creating such a system basically a
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
secure website and I said could you give
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
me a rough idea of the cost of doing
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
that and so he looked at all the specs
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
and so on and the number he came up with
 
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.270 align:start position:0%
and so on and the number he came up with
was

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
$224,000 okay so
 
00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
$244,000 all right so let's say that
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
that's too low okay um it's certainly so
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
the number I'm coming up with is
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
$200,000 and it's I feel like that's
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
splitting the difference right it's
 
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
eight times bigger than what my
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
consultant says he can do it for which
 
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.430 align:start position:0%
consultant says he can do it for which
is

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:18:46.149 --> 00:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
$24,000 and it's eight times less than
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
what these bills these agencies want to
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
realistic so eron I have a question I
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
know when the Senate bill it had
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
specific dollar amounts 750,000 for the
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and then
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
$986,000 for the judicial branch where
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
did those numbers come from thank you
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
very much for the question uh in in this
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
instance this we were having this
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
discussion last year and we we had an
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to our current vendor
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and get a bit and I think the some of
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
the costlier items were the licenses for
 
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
the software and that there was the need
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
for continuing support um for the
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
software so the initial start startup
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
costs were high but our annual is about
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
300,000 for the judicial branch I I
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
could not tell you what that would be
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
for for uh the department of safety so I
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
I think representative McGuire you're
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
you're estimate around 100,000 that is
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
very close to that 300,000 bid that we
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
have for the annual maintenance um but
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
we did uh at that time and subsequently
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
have a chance to talk with the
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology and
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
Safety and see if there were other
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
Alternatives because of course we know
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
costs are are very important and at
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
least at this time I I don't think we
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
were able to find that there was a more
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
cost effective alternative although um
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
you know certainly understand the desire
 
00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:09.559 align:start position:0%
to find one so so here's why here's my
 
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
argument let's give the 200,000 to the
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
let's have them put out a bid if they
 
00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
can get a qualified vendor such as the
 
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:24.200 align:start position:0%
one I found um and uh if they perform
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
they get paid right and then we're done
 
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
um if not not okay we've delayed a year
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
or whatever and we can go with this you
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
know their vendors are way too
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculously expensive from from my
 
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
point of view so that's the way I would
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
do it is is not charge not have the
 
00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:46.039 align:start position:0%
Judiciary not have the department of
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
safety um except to distribute this but
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
but to have
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
doit hire somebody to create this this
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um secure website so that's what I'd
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
like to do and if it if it fails we you
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
know we've wasted a year but you know I
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
think it won't fail so all right well I
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
will say I don't think we can afford a
 
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
year and I'm going to caution the
 
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.470 align:start position:0%
year and I'm going to caution the
division

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
again I see representative Lynn sitting
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
out here I've had communication this
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
morning with the chairman Roy and I
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to see us go too far off into
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
policy on this where I know this 100%
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
money it has 100% money but if we don't
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
provide enough money you're not going to
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
implement the policy that's my concern
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why I asked Aaron to come up
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
to let us know where these numbers are
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
coming from because I don't want to
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
jeopardize this important policy on bail
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
reform because we're not providing
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
adequate funds to make it happen one one
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
other point on that this particular part
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
of the bail reform is independent of all
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
the other pieces right this is an
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
information system we don't have it
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
today right what it'll do for us is
 
00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
allow us to know if somebody's on the
 
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
third offense or you know they're out on
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
bail twice and therefore they need to be
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
arrested right but but we don't know
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
that today and and it's independent of
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's magistrates or whether
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's not magistrate all this other
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
stuff the 24 hours it doesn't have
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that so it's it's a
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
separate decision all
 
00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:29.590 align:start position:0%
separate decision all
right

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
further comments from the
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
Sweeny represent you B um thank you Mr
 
00:22:40.039 --> 00:22:41.549 align:start position:0%
Sweeny represent you B um thank you Mr
chair

00:22:41.549 --> 00:22:41.559 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
I I think that uh if we don't trust doit
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's a complete break from the way we
 
00:22:51.789 --> 00:22:51.799 align:start position:0%
usually do things I mean I've worked
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
with doit in various contexts like over
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
at Public Works you've worked with them
 
00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
at Public Works you've worked with them
here

00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:02.120 align:start position:0%
I think that uh commissioner goule is an
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
amazing person he's fully conscious of
 
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
cost concerns for the State of New
 
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I this just would be a I'm
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
not saying doing something different is
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
a bad thing but this would be kind of a
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
break from the way we usually uh move
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
forward on really important pieces of
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
policy like this and like you I have
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
some concern about delaying a year
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
to figure things
 
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
out so Mr Hoffman could you get a hold
 
00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
of commissioner gou and ask him if he
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
can venture over here at some point this
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
morning yes I can do that I also just to
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
add a little bit about the current
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
process all executive branch agencies
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
are required to go through
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
doit and projects are required to be
 
00:23:56.909 --> 00:23:56.919 align:start position:0%
competitively bid and approved by
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
governor and Council
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if it's helpful but you
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
may consider an any appropriation
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
language to
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
include funds may not be spent for any
 
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.070 align:start position:0%
include funds may not be spent for any
other

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.630 align:start position:0%
other
purpose

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
um I I'll contact uh Dennis glay but
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
also on the county question when we do
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
our uh annual updates to the um what we
 
00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
call get tough bills the cost to the
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
judicial and Correctional systems the
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
county provided us a a dollar amount of
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
about $15 to
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
someone uh between 105 and
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
$125 per day which of course depends on
 
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:54.669 align:start position:0%
$125 per day which of course depends on
the

00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
county yes
 
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.269 align:start position:0%
county yes
sir

00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
sir
 
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
forgive me I did just want to mention
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
since the ongoing legislative
 
00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
negotiations of the bail Bill package we
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
did have a i our director not me
 
00:25:07.909 --> 00:25:07.919 align:start position:0%
personally did connect with commissioner
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
gulay about the estimates and he had
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
thought that they sounded about right
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
the ones that we got from our vendor I
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
don't say that to discourage you from
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
speaking with him personally but we have
 
00:25:18.389 --> 00:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to connect at the
 
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
leadership level with
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
doit I figur the numbers we had here
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
were fairly accurate that other people
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
have been looking at them but I just
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
just want to again again no disrespect
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh but I don't want to see us mck this
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
thing up so we interfere with this bail
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
reform which everybody on both sides of
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
the issue wants to see get done this
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
year and as soon as possible
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so representative cambrell did you have
 
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:50.200 align:start position:0%
or thank you Mr chair um you you
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned the it's your vendor um but we
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
said it went out to a competitive bid
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
did the current vendor win that bid or
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
so is that a case of you're kind of a
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
prisoner to the current vendor we're
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question we're we
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
would have to bid it competitively it
 
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to get an estimate for
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of appropriating the
 
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
provision but we would have to put it to
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
a competitive bid and it is possible
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
that someone would come in lower um our
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
vendor knows our system is already
 
00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:23.919 align:start position:0%
plugged into our system relatively well
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
and at least the appraisals we've gotten
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
have indicated that it would be a comp
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
bid but you are certainly right that
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
someone could come with a better bid in
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
which case we would spend
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
less and especially a key thing is is
 
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
this an independent new system or is it
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
have to hook into the their existing
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
system right because that makes that
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
that vendor be the person all right so
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
anyway um before we go much further I
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
see that inquisitive look from my friend
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh sitting in the front row represented
 
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
ly did you have anything to add or you
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
observe forgive me a second the only
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is this I I do not
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
profess to have any particularly current
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
knowledge in terms of the cost issue the
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is that um
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
and I would ask uh the prior speaker if
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
if she has a different view on this but
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
I think I think the idea of having an
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
independent system for this might be a
 
00:27:33.389 --> 00:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
problem because it it seems to me that
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to be able to be integrated
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
into the current sort of case management
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
system um I I would think that that you
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
know that that would need to be in other
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
words if you had if you had a if you if
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
you developed a you know a brand new
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
system and let's say it worked so that
 
00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:53.519 align:start position:0%
police officers could determine if
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
somebody was on bail from somewhere else
 
00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
but that system couldn't talk
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the case management system that is
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
already exists for the judicial branch I
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
think that would be a problem that I
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
mean that's that's that's my sense and
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
EXA and again I'm not I defer to
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire in terms of the
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
technology because when I turn my
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
computer on in the morning I often have
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
to ask my wife you know please help me
 
00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:23.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's broken down and I
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
can't fix it so
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
I so here's the problem is apparently
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
they're not willing to do that to to
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
give everyone access to their system you
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
see what I mean their system actually
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
has the piece of paper that the bail
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner wrote on right so so their
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
system actually has the information
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
today and it actually does sort it by by
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
accused right so so you would have to
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
allow all bail Commissioners all police
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
Etc to have a log into that system allow
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
them to query the people and then they
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
could see oh here's the bail sheet for
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
this this particular guy um and so they
 
00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:15.480 align:start position:0%
don't even need any new software today
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
they just need that but apparently they
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
haven't been willing to do that right
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
they want a new $1.7 million thing well
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
you know again
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
I'm I I think it's it you need to be
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
careful there because there certainly
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
should the should police officers be
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
able to see that sure of course but
 
00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's you know I can I can easily
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
understand that there may be that it
 
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
would be improper to just give the
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
police complete access to the system
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
because there are many things in the
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
court file that police officers should
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
not see um you know confidential kind of
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
information or things that a defendant
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
may have filed in camera things like
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's I guess all I'm saying
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
is it's complicated now you see the
 
00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:07.640 align:start position:0%
reason for a separate system that that
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't have sensitive information in it
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
that just has the information in it that
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
is necessary for this task I agree with
 
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
you that in general having multiple
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
systems can be a problem but guess what
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
you know people use multiple websites
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
for all different kinds of things this
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
problem is solved by a separate separate
 
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:32.200 align:start position:0%
system and it's not solved by an
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
integrated system because they have to
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
go through and say okay for every piece
 
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:40.600 align:start position:0%
of paper type that's in this data who's
 
00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
authorized to see it and who isn't and
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
all that sort of
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
stuff the only last comment I make is
 
00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start position:0%
this I and I want I I don't know the
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
answer to this question but I mean I
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
assume that other states have dealt with
 
00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
this issue and other states must have
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
and I you know I just be curious as to
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
what if there's been some exploration of
 
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
what other states do because I would
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
assume that you know Massachusetts or
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or whatever have have had
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
the same kind of problem and hopefully
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
have have solved it uh and that that's
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
really all I can add thank you I'm glad
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
to see you have the same problem with
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
your laptop in the morning I often
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
threaten to take mine outside and shoot
 
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.549 align:start position:0%
threaten to take mine outside and shoot
it

00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
but represent Sweeney Mr I guess for me
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of it becomes a a chicken in
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
the egg scenario where we pass a bill
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
that says we're authorizing up to 1.7
 
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240 align:start position:0%
million for software package that will
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
go out to Bid And I think anybody that's
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
bidding on that is going to get close to
 
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
that 1.7 million uh it sort of justifies
 
00:31:45.639 --> 00:31:46.990 align:start position:0%
that 1.7 million uh it sort of justifies
it

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:48.919 align:start position:0%
self-fulfilling that they're going to
 
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
bid up to what we've authorized to bid
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know but I I don't I don't
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with the experts here that are
 
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
saying that this is what similar systems
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
would cost and they got there before
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
putting it out to bid officially getting
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
in the quotes is is tough because you
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
can't do that until we pass the bill so
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there would be the
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
ability not to punt on the issue but to
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
pass the the legislation allow for the
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
bid to go out and then leave the final
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
authorization to
 
00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal so I don't see us being able to
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually say we're going to appropriate
 
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
$1.7 million for a software pack package
 
00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:32.519 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to get a $500,000 or
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
$200,000 proposal because that it's not
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
in the range that the bid is looking for
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
so I it's it's a tough it's a tough
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
quandry because you do set what the
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
level of bids will come in at by setting
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
it in the legislation and so you're only
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
going to get that software so I don't
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
have a a solution to it but that's just
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
my two cents
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
thanks representative eil um do were you
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
going to try to get commissioner goule
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
in or talk to I mean it would just be
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
went yeah I'm just I mean it'd be
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
interesting to have his input on that
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
because he goes through that sort of
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
thing all the time um because it is
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
challenging especially if it's a
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
government contract that's being let
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
represented grass yeah having worked on
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
the software field as well I I think
 
00:33:23.389 --> 00:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
that you know one of the things that we
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
find is always a problem is when you
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
have different interfaces and
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes having a consistent interface
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for everybody to use and
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
if you have different vendors you're
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
going to have different interfaces and
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
what you can do is you can develop a
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
system that has different security
 
00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:40.039 align:start position:0%
levels on it as well so that someone
 
00:33:41.789 --> 00:33:41.799 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to have more sensitive
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
information doesn't have access to that
 
00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
more sensitive information I'm certainly
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
for consistency in interface because I
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
think we see it throughout the systems
 
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
that we have particularly if you look at
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
HHS when you have problems over there
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other um it it
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
creates um a mess uh and being able to
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
have and being able to ACC access
 
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
information across the system is much
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
better than having separate SE separate
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
vendors where they don't communicate or
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
they are unable to communicate with each
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
other um and you know when they say oh
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
yeah it's going to work but what ends
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
ends up happening when it doesn't work
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
they're pointing fingers in each other
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
and if it cost us a little bit more to
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
get consistency I would support that I'm
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
not saying that the $1.7 million is the
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
way to go I think that you know
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
certainly representative McGuire has
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
made some valid points on on his case
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
but the thing is is that I would rather
 
00:34:33.629 --> 00:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
see consistency of interface and
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
information in one location rather than
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
divide it up into multiple
 
00:34:41.629 --> 00:34:41.639 align:start position:0%
locations thanks we do have a number of
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
amendments I see at least two that you
 
00:34:47.069 --> 00:34:47.079 align:start position:0%
have on this particular package you do
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
you why don't we all right we're going
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
to wait on this particular issue we're
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
going to wait until we he from the
 
00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
commission let's talk about the other
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
big issue as I see it on the on the page
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
and that's the magistrates okay the 15
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
magistrates so um this these bills
 
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
imagine they're they're one per County
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
plus a few okay um and they work
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
weekends and they do all case types
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
because because bail um bail
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are being restricted right
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
to to fewer case types um but expensive
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
right each each magistrate is like
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
$150,000 a year person okay um so we're
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
adding 225,000 or so per year 2.25
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
million per year to the cost of the
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
Judiciary um what's the
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
alternative so the alternative
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
is uh number one we could
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
just we're we're improving the bail
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
Commissioners lot here right we're we're
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
giving them more money we're making the
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
money guaranteed we're getting them
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
better training so they'll do a better
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
job presumably all right so that
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully will attract the number 95 to
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
get bigger so that there will be
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
there'll be more bail Commissioners
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
there won't they won't be as uh tightly
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
um scheduled okay so we could just sort
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
of stop there
 
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
right and and say let's try that for a
 
00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
year or so and then if if still there's
 
00:36:34.319 --> 00:36:35.190 align:start position:0%
year or so and then if if still there's
a

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:36:39.069 --> 00:36:39.079 align:start position:0%
problem okay maybe add some magistrates
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
right that would be one
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
choice um another one would
 
00:36:43.359 --> 00:36:44.990 align:start position:0%
choice um another one would
be

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
um uh still have the bail Commissioners
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
tell them they can only do fewer cases
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
right and tell some judges you've got to
 
00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
right and tell some judges you've got to
work

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
weekends and uh um you've got to uh but
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
but you could do all your stuff by Zoom
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that's how it's likely that's
 
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
how magistrates are going to end up
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
working is is by Zoom
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
essentially um because some of these
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
counties are quite large and we're
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
talking about one per County the
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates not going to be driving all
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
over the place like the bail
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
Commissioners are right so so that would
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
be another thing right there there's not
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
that many cases
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
maybe do we have a number the number of
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
cases in
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
the uh you know first and second degree
 
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
on the the cases that are specifically
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
not able to be heard by a bail
 
00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner anymore under this
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislation is about 1400 a year okay
 
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
1400 a year is uh 30 a
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
week right so um
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
so so you're talking about
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
um a handful of Judges working Saturday
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
and Sunday maybe right so um I don't
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
know how long it takes to to decide such
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
a case half an
 
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
hour I don't does that sound right a lot
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
of speculation
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
yeah all right well anyways so my my
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
point is you know a judge coming in
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
somebody who's available Saturday
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
somebody is available
 
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
Sunday um doing it by Zoom so there's
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
only one in the state or two in the
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
state on Saturday and two on the state
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
on Sunday something like that um that's
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
another way to go okay um and it's cases
 
00:38:47.349 --> 00:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
that they would be deciding anyways so
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's not like there's more cases or
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
whatever U not that much more work so
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's another way to go right without
 
00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:57.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates and and don't spend the 2
 
00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
magistrates and and don't spend the 2
million

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
you could also you could also say fewer
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
than 15 right take instead of those two
 
00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
or three judges working weekends get two
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
or three magistrates working weekends
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
right not 15 that's another way to do it
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
all right but but the main thing is it
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
seems likely that since these
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates are not traveling because
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
because the issue is if if they go to
 
00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
court if they have to go to the county
 
00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
court that means you got to have a clerk
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
there you got to have security there you
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
got to have you know all that sort of
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
stuff opening the door on the weekend uh
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
those people are going to be paid
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
overtime and your time and a half and
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
all this stuff so so it has to in order
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
for this to work even the way it's
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
written now it's got to be over Zoom
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
right and and my
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
point to make it so the problem with
 
00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is the bail commissioner is there
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
in person with the accused they can take
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
the measure of the Accused by talking to
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
them directly right and so making that
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
decision I have a hard time seeing that
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
the bail magistrate is going to make
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
that much better of a
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
decision meeting somebody over the phone
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
or over Zoom you see what I mean so I
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
have I have a hard time seeing that that
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
$2 million is worth
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
spending representa Griffin
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
please I think in your scenario one
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
where we expand the bail
 
00:40:40.109 --> 00:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and guarantee the payment
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
and get them some
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
training and see how it goes for a year
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
or two I think that's far superior to
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
setting up magistrates that we have no
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
idea how it's going to work how it'll
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
work out and it's very
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
expensive uh I'm impressed with bail
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners I met one
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
recently and most of them I think are
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
there they're volunteers really the
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
money doesn't mean that much to them I
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
mention the fact that we had a bill that
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
was going to guarantee the money and
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
they said well if you think we're doing
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
it for the money you're
 
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
crazy they're really good people they're
 
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about you know they they're
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
very diligent in their job and I'd like
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
to see us not just bail out on them I'd
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
like to see us see if we can expand it
 
00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
and and make it work a little better
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
before we spend millions and millions of
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
magistrates pres of Evo um I I like to
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
ask one of the experts in the room
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't the point of the ne the intense
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
negotiation on this uh a point of
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
contention was that there was the list
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
of crimes was it 14 that uh people felt
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
in particular needed a higher level of
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
review and that's why they came up with
 
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.069 align:start position:0%
review and that's why they came up with
the

00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:14.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:17.069 --> 00:42:17.079 align:start position:0%
magistrate concept I mean that was a
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
point a huge point of
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
negotiation um because they didn't want
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
these bigger crimes to be handled by
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners I'm I'm I'm seeing
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
nods yeah if you look at the Senate bill
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 that came out there were
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
a number of
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
um crimes that are no would no longer be
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
handled by bail Commissioners first
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
degree assault second degree assault
 
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
felony level domestic violence
 
00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
aggregated uh
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
a aggravated fonia sexual
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:05.480 align:start position:0%

of child sexual abuse
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
images and the list goes on so those are
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
all the items again it came out of the
 
00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
Senate that would be restricted
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
specifically towards two magistrates
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners this is one of those items
 
00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
where if you pull the thread the s
 
00:43:29.069 --> 00:43:29.079 align:start position:0%
letter is going to start to fall apart
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I think a lot of this uh Rose and
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
fall fell on the existence of the
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
magistrate system um I also not
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
recalling exactly what the
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the magistrates were
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
were the attorneys
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
orne so it's a much higher level of
 
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:51.440 align:start position:0%
review than what would be given by a
 
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.109 align:start position:0%
review than what would be given by a
bail

00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner further questions
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative sweenee I I seem to
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
recall I think the number 15 was said to
 
00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
come from a previous bill in which there
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
were no bail
 
00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:14.030 align:start position:0%
were no bail
Commissioners

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
present uh the judicial branch did
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
complete a fiscal note for a previous
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
Bill about what we would do if we were
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
required by Statute to eliminate bail
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and we estimated 15 I
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
understand from speaking with chairman
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
Roy his estimate of 15 comes on
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
Geographic coverage most bail
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioners go in person to the jails
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
and he wanted there to be at least one
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
person Per County and some coverage so
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers are the same but and I had
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
originally thought he had taken that
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
from that previous bill but I understand
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
he wanted to have Geographic coverage
 
00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
and that's his policy intention thank
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
you follow follow
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
conversation so I understand the need
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
for magistrates in order to get the
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
24hour case turned
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
around for those specific cases and 30
 
00:45:02.109 --> 00:45:02.119 align:start position:0%
cases a week uh I just think I'd be
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with five
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
magistrates and I'm thinking one per
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
executive Council District if we set it
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
up that way I do think a lot of it would
 
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:10.430 align:start position:0%
up that way I do think a lot of it would
be

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
telecommunications of the magistrates
 
00:45:15.069 --> 00:45:15.079 align:start position:0%
into the the county areas so they
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be physically there but
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
in my mind five magistrates could handle
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
six cases a week that gets us over the
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
that gets us to the 30 cases that need
 
00:45:27.549 --> 00:45:27.559 align:start position:0%
to be handled and they would allow
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to work for the judicial
 
00:45:31.710 --> 00:45:31.720 align:start position:0%
branch on other areas as well helping
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
speed up the the meeting the audit of
 
00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:35.640 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch that we saw last
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
year for case load so I I I can't
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
support 15 I I'm I'd be more comfortable
 
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:44.440 align:start position:0%
with five since it seems to be the Lynch
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
pin to get the 24hour cases uh going and
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it's easier to start with a
 
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
smaller number of magistrates and if in
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
two years the judicial branch says it's
 
00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
it's overc capacity a future legislature
 
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
can look at that but we're not going to
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
start with 15 and be able to scale that
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
back if it's not
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
necessary um I think that if we're going
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
to try to cut costs it is the number of
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
magistrates we should be focusing on i'
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
I'd be interested in what chair Roy's
 
00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
idea would be I remember I asked him
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
specifically because we had thought
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
about this what he thought the bare
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
minimum should be and he did say 10 and
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
he was focused on the n number of um
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
counties so maybe there's a magical
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
number between five and 15 but it really
 
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I'd find a I'd be interested to just
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
get his feedback since he's
 
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:46.440 align:start position:0%
the he's so deeply involved in this but
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
look represent Maguire so I'll ask Judge
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
Lynn um
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
you've talked to me personally before
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
about Judges working
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
weekends right what what do you think
 
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:07.280 align:start position:0%
about that he's just really glad he's
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
retired no you know I have to say it
 
00:47:13.309 --> 00:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
respectfully to who to to
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
everyone it the idea that judges
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't work weekends is baloney I
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
mean they they're working weekends now I
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
to be to be you know I in the 27 or
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
almost 27 years I was at the in the
 
00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.870 align:start position:0%
almost 27 years I was at the in the
judicial

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
judicial
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
branch unquestionably the majority of of
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
the weekends that fell in that time I
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
was working at least part of the time
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
and sometimes both days now I wasn't
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
working in the court generally I was
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
working from home but working on stuff
 
00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
but sometime it was in the court doing
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know not doing hearings but doing
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
doing research or writing or being at
 
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
the library so the idea I mean judges
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
are paid a very good salary and the idea
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
that they shouldn't have to work some
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
weekends that you couldn't you know
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
include them in the mix of of like
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
having rotating Duty it I find that
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
offensive it's just because they're
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
doing it anyway and there's no reason
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they that they shouldn't do it they
 
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
do it in other states in some states
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
they have night courts and stuff I'm not
 
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting that necessarily but there's
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's just no reason that judges
 
00:48:20.589 --> 00:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to work uh you know some
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
some weekends and so I guess I would say
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
I think you ought to figure that in the
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
mix of what whatever you're doing that
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's not you know it's not offensive to
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
me in any way that judges should have to
 
00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
work weekends because as I said they're
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing it anyway I have no doubt about
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
that represent mire so if we were to ask
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
them to do bailed decisions over the
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
weekend right um number one do they need
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
ancillary people their clerk the other
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
people together with them at the same
 
00:48:55.309 --> 00:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
time and number two roughly how much
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
time would you think average bail case
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
takes I think Pro I mean particularly if
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to have I assume as you did
 
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
I think that Mo that virtually all of
 
00:49:06.589 --> 00:49:06.599 align:start position:0%
these would be done you know
 
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
electronically through Zoom or something
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
like that um nonetheless I think there
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
probably would still need to be some
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
ancillary people they also prob
 
00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
presumably could be done by Zoom all you
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
know also but you would probably need
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
some ancillary support people uh uh to
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
be doing that and in terms of you know
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
how uh for initial appearance bail kind
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
of thing I think uh you said a half an
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
hour I think that's probably a good
 
00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
estimate some in some in some matters
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know it that's probably it would
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
take significantly less than that there
 
00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
might be a few where it would be more
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
but I I would say you know the idea of a
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
half an hour is probably a reasonable
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
estimate would be my
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
view I'm I'm sorry I I mean this is a
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
lot to learn for us are are Judges doing
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
some bail work now over the weekends do
 
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
you know okay I'm seeing no I don't
 
00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:03.720 align:start position:0%
think so no I don't think they are so
 
00:50:05.309 --> 00:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
when I saying you know as I said again
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
as I said the work that I that I think
 
00:50:08.589 --> 00:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
most judges are doing now on the
 
00:50:10.829 --> 00:50:10.839 align:start position:0%
weekends is writing orders doing
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
research that kind of thing most of that
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
is probably from home but I you know I
 
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
think sometime they are going into the
 
00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
to the local court because it's got a
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
better Library situation or something
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
like that but but the idea that they're
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
not working is just it's not accurate
 
00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.630 align:start position:0%
not working is just it's not accurate
they

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.589 align:start position:0%
they
are

00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.599 --> 00:50:34.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
Aaron thank you Mr chairman I I did just
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
want to mention that we did have an
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity the judicial branch to speak
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
with the uh policy committee about the
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
alternative of of Judges doing these
 
00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
determinations on weekends and and there
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
are some complications uh the need for
 
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
support staff which is typically
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
unionized and has a no weekend clause in
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
their um in their contracts uh the need
 
00:50:59.069 --> 00:50:59.079 align:start position:0%
for a Judicial decision rather than a
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
magistrate or bail commissioner decision
 
00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
to be immediately reported to the
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
registry which means the registry has to
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
be open through the weekend rais the
 
00:51:09.309 --> 00:51:09.319 align:start position:0%
costs and I think the policy committee
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
came to the realization that the
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
magistrate saved a lot of those
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
ancillary Staffing costs they would work
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
like a bail commissioner does now sort
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
of a super bail commissioner a highly
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
qualified bail commissioner and it those
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
additional costs wouldn't be incurred uh
 
00:51:24.069 --> 00:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with chairman Lynn
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
that judges work a lot of hours and they
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
are certainly working weekends right now
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
um we we have 44 Circuit Court judges
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
and our latest evaluation of how many we
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
need was 65 um so they are they are
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
working um but judicial time is not
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
unlimited um and magistrates time is
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
time are there any more questions I
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
don't see the commissioner of doit yet
 
00:51:56.109 --> 00:51:56.119 align:start position:0%
so maybe this would be a good time for
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:51:59.390 --> 00:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
explain some of your amendments I have
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
sent a text to commission uh chairman
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
Roy to get his input on the
 
00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
number maybe we can just oh oh sorry
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
yeah commissioner goule is at Governor
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
counsil this morning and he asked if two
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock would be
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:25.390 --> 00:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well we'll talk I'll tell them
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up later all right all
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
right so why don't we
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
um how about this we'll just move that
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
we have five magistrates why don't why
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
don't we do
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
that I would rather wait until we talk
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
to uh chairman Roy you know he was
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
adamant to on numbers I think he said
 
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
there was some flexibility but I don't
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
know whether
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
five would meet uh the criminal justice
 
00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799 align:start position:0%
committee's recommendation and as you
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
recall the criminal justice committee
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
committee voted
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously uh these bills to bring that
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
number of magistrates forward so it's a
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
courtesy to uh chairman Roy I'd like to
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
hear from him first if that's all right
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't I mean these are all the
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
other you know line by line type stuff
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
is to make everything consistent right
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
right it's
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
not you know it it's not
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
um these are the main decisions I don't
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any other cost
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
item that that aren't up there I have
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
one question for um represent on the
 
00:53:36.069 --> 00:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
monitoring by the court is that that was
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
something you said was right okay so why
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't we talk about that yeah that's a
 
00:53:41.549 --> 00:53:41.559 align:start position:0%
good point that that is the other big
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
cost thing so um monitoring so I believe
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
in these bills you've got an amendment
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
on monitoring right yeah I think we do
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
actually this is with the electronic
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
bracelets is this yeah the the ankle
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
bracelets yeah
 
00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
so um as we understand it some counties
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
and I know marac does and straford does
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
have uh already they're using these
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
ankle bracelets on serious um serious
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
offenders who who are out on bail and
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:54:23.309 --> 00:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
so there's a cost to that they they all
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
these none of these are owned by the
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
counties they're all rented and so
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an ongoing cost for
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
renting but then there's also monitoring
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
because there's somebody who's got you
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
know their cell phone beeps anytime
 
00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
somebody steps inside the the the
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited Zone which according to the
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
person I talk to happens all the time
 
00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
right so um and so there and and it
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
turns out the way this software works is
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
that the ankle bracelet has effectively
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
a walkietalkie in it and so the person
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
monitoring when they get the beep they
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
can go into the software and say to the
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
guy hey you're in a restricted Zone get
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
out of there what are you doing you know
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
and the guy can answer back and all this
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff I mean it's you know crazy
 
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
and and um charge for a second okay sure
 
00:55:15.789 --> 00:55:15.799 align:start position:0%
so so uh do do you see what I mean so so
 
00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:17.720 align:start position:0%
the ankle bracelet talks to them and
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
they say oh I didn't realize and they
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
leave whatever so
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
um and and then the person monitoring if
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
the person person stays inside this
 
00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
restricted Zone they call the cops and
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
the cops come and get the guy so um so
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
anyways but all that stuff is done by
 
00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
counties but I the way the bills read
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
it's done by the courts right so the
 
00:55:46.109 --> 00:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
courts would have to set up a whole new
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
system and all that sort of stuff and
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
they're not in general in charge of
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
prisoners right they're they're in
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
charge of um what happens in court so so
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
number one I would move all this stuff
 
00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
from the courts to the counties and then
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
I would simply put in it doesn't seem to
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
be a cost item because uh except in this
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
in the case of um of uh people who can't
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
afford it right there's there's language
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
in these bills about if somebody is
 
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:20.200 align:start position:0%
Indigent and can't afford the $100 a
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
week or whatever it is then it'll be
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
covered by the state right so uh um or
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary so effectively the state
 
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
so so um I don't know if we can
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
estimate what that's cost is going to be
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
but but it seems like it's a good idea
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah one of one of the the
 
00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:43.240 align:start position:0%
questions I have is my understanding is
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
that the state does this when they do
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
early early release from the state
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
prison a lot of times they will have
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
them on ankle monitors I'm sure we could
 
00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
find out from the state prison what it's
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
costing them to do it and if they've
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
already got a system set up at the state
 
00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:56.789 align:start position:0%
already got a system set up at the state
level

00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:56.799 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
why would we have to create a new system
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
to you know the court system to do this
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
if the state is already monitoring and
 
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
if they've already got the provisions
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
for monitoring um you know if it's if
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
it's established we should use what's
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
there well we're talking about here I
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
think pre-trial people right Andor right
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
but but the state is not normally
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
involved in the pre-trial phase of it
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
right they're either in the county jail
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
or or not right or or in the county
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
courts right so yeah um anyways go ahead
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so just again being respectful of
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
the process that this has been through
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the negotiated points I guess I
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
pretty much believe that practically
 
00:57:39.069 --> 00:57:39.079 align:start position:0%
everything in here is in here for a
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
reason so before I would interpose our
 
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:44.559 align:start position:0%
judgment on it I would ask why it would
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
set up this
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
way so I don't know who can answer that
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
question Miss Gan and uh rep use if you
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak as well but I I believe
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
this was relatively late edition that it
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
was assigned to the courts um so I don't
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
understand that to be an essential
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
feature that it be the courts rather
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
than the counties conducting the
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring but but we do not conduct
 
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:06.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring now I know in many states
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
there's a pre-trial division in the
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
courts and folks that might have worked
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
in other states uh are familiar with it
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
we simply don't have that we don't have
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
any staff that covers monitoring um so I
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
understand why someone who might have
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
been in mass or place that there's a
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
pre-trial would be very familiar with
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
that and would think that that's an
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
intuitive place for it um but I I think
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
the counties administer that here and
 
00:58:32.109 --> 00:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
prerogative that is my understanding as
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
well uh so I'm I I don't think that
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
there was I think part of the reason why
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
the courts may have been in there in the
 
00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:44.920 align:start position:0%
first place is because uh we've been
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
very focused all along in this process
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of what changing the process
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
would actually uh mean for the courts in
 
00:58:55.029 --> 00:58:55.039 align:start position:0%
terms of additional cost in terms of
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
things like additional person El
 
00:58:59.230 --> 00:58:59.240 align:start position:0%
requirements um so essentially if we're
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
getting to the same
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
outcome I think that's I think that's
 
00:59:04.589 --> 00:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
workable and the outcome we're trying to
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
get to by the way is to make sure uh
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
with all of these bills I think one of
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
the things that we're trying to achieve
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
is and and what this compromise is
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
really all about is enhancing Public
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
Safety uh and I think that's that's
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
really um what kept us focus in in
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and one of the things
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
we also knew was we had a bunch of
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
things that we needed to balance uh we
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
needed to balance the civil rights of
 
00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
defendants um we needed to uh you know
 
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
to balance the fact that we couldn't
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
make every single change to the system
 
00:59:44.589 --> 00:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
that we wanted so I think the where we
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
are on on the bills that have come to
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
you uh is that I
 
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
think in criminal justice I think all of
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
us view uh these bills and these
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
processes as a as a good start and I
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we found
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
with B form as a whole is that the
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
process is evolutionary so I don't think
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
we're done yet um I don't I'm not sure
 
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
we'll ever be done I think there are
 
01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
always ways we can continue to improve
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
it but where we are now is we we're in
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
this unique situation where we have law
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement State reps uh on both sides
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh the American civil liberties Union uh
 
01:00:30.309 --> 01:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
and uh uh every stakeholder you can
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
imagine um is supporting the compromise
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
in front of you and I and I think as
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
representative yel has said um when you
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
start picking at
 
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
threads that's the easiest way to kind
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
of unwind uh the whole thing because so
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
many of these things are are so
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
interrelated to we found that to Pro to
 
01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
solve one problem we had to address
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
another problem and sometimes to address
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
that under Ling problem there were two
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
more problems that we needed to to do
 
01:01:02.109 --> 01:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
and that's what made this so involved
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
and and made it so complicated and you
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
know I apologize that it came to you in
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
the form of so many bills um but um
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
that's what it took to to get it through
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
and and I really appreciate your work in
 
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:16.520 align:start position:0%
trying to move this
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
forward and we're trying to get to a
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
home base here representative evil okay
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I just uh as we go down this uh
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring issue I just want to be
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
crystal clear that whether it's the
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
courts or we come up with another
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
concept for the counties it's okay from
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
a policy standpoint that you guys don't
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
think it is a thread that's going to
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
make everything ra unravel I think the
 
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:45.640 align:start position:0%
most important thing is it gets done uh
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh who does it and who's in charge of
 
01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:50.230 align:start position:0%
uh who does it and who's in charge of
it

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so I did speak to Chairman Roy and
 
01:01:56.430 --> 01:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh on the magistrate issue
 
01:01:58.990 --> 01:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
and he said doesn't really like the idea
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
but 10 would be better than five or none
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
but he said 10 would be his preferred
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
number one for each
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
County representative
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
wer we forget we say one per County the
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
relative sizes of populations to the 10
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
counties I like his idea better five the
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
same as each executive counsel because
 
01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
each one has the same population roughly
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
so they should have the same exposure to
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
bad guys on a per capita basis whereas
 
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
in counties you got two counties that
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
have over half the
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
population so you know it it kind of
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
makes it awkward when this county has
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
300,000 people this one has
 
01:02:50.269 --> 01:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
30,000 you pay the same but your
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
exposure is much different how many
 
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
people are likely to be needing bail so
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's a good way to look
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
at it if you want equal populations
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
obviously district one is going to have
 
01:03:05.069 --> 01:03:05.079 align:start position:0%
a lot more driving time if someone had
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
to drive but you know the the
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh by looking at the population I think
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
we have a strong argument to say this is
 
01:03:16.109 --> 01:03:16.119 align:start position:0%
equal exposure for each magistrate to
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
how many what's the percentage of bad
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
guys per population and I don't think it
 
01:03:23.029 --> 01:03:23.039 align:start position:0%
varies much from County to
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
County well there's probably more bad
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
guys than Kingston than there are in my
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
town but in all seriousness I think
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
allow them they send them to the
 
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
allow them they send them to the
legislature

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:34.030 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:03:34.030 --> 01:03:36.990 align:start position:0%
legislature
[Laughter]

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
yeah but I I just think again you know
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
if you look at the executive council
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
districts as you mentioned district one
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
up is huge yeah and uh I don't think the
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
magistrates are going to be restricted
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
to the counties if you need it the court
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
needs to have two magistrates that they
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County due to you know the
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
workload in Manchester and Nashville
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
there's two courts as you know in
 
01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:04.839 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County they can be moved
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
around even though the specific 10
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
counties they're not going to be
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
restricted to Sullivan County or
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County yeah but you know if
 
01:04:16.109 --> 01:04:16.119 align:start position:0%
you're trying to look at the exposure of
 
01:04:19.870 --> 01:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
a magistrate likely to have a call The
 
01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:22.359 align:start position:0%
Districts would be about equal but if
 
01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
you start to go to counties one little
 
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
County with 25,000 people you know they
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
might not have two a
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
weekend want to add that my idea kind of
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
works with the fact that Hillsboro has
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
two courts nashwa and Manchester are in
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
separate executive counc
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
districts so you could have a magistrate
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
stationed in each area there with the
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that they are
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
going to use
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
telecommunications to address most of
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
their workload and very rarely will be
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
in person in front of somebody uh which
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
is that's the the bail Commissioners
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
will be traveling to be in person in
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
front of people the magistrates can be
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
in an office or a courtroom uh depending
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
on how the judicial branch lines it up
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
and do their jobs from the computer to
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
to have their hearings within those 24
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
hours so I I I'm I'm in support of five
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
and obviously the conversations will
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
continue we know what happens in this
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
division goes through the full finance
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
committee and then to the floor of the
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
house where who knows what happens but I
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
think out of this Division I would
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
support five
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
magistrates so I'm taking that you're
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
moving that I would I would move we
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of magistrates from 15
 
01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
to five and representative Campell is
 
01:05:59.390 --> 01:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
seconding that further discussion
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I just want to
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
point out to everybody here there's a
 
01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
reason why the finance committee is
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
involved in this process and that is
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
that um people in the subject area
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
certainly have their focus but that's
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
all their focus and we are in charge of
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
the limited resources of the state and
 
01:06:27.789 --> 01:06:27.799 align:start position:0%
and we have constraints on us that are
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
not just however important Judiciary and
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and all those things are
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's also education there's also
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
Health there's also Dees there's also
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
this that and the other you know
 
01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State everything else and
 
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we are not made of money you know and
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that um when we
 
01:06:54.349 --> 01:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
spend we're spending wisely it's it's
 
01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
that simple and and
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
just because chairman Roy or anyone else
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
says it's got to be this way well it's
 
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:07.480 align:start position:0%
not that way now so so whatever you know
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
if we can give you halfway to what you
 
01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
want that's that's some improvement you
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.630 align:start position:0%
 
sometimes

01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
questiones it's not so much a question
 
01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
is you know I'm I've always I I thought
 
01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
the failure in the previous system was
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill Commissioners just weren't
 
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:27.640 align:start position:0%
trained and if the bail Commissioners
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
were trained that we wouldn't have the
 
01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
problems that we're having in the system
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
and but I've come around a little bit on
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
supporting the magistrates because of I
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
think the court systems are overburdened
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
and this may be a way to help uh help
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
some of the burden that they have uh and
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
also take some of the burden off on bail
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
Commissioners who you know for whatever
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
reason and again I think one of the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
biggest problems is they were not
 
01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
trained and if they were given training
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
I think they could do their job
 
01:07:56.670 --> 01:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
adequately I'm to support A reduced
 
01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
number of magistrates and you know you
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
talk about meeting them halfway that
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be seven so would be closer than
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
halfway than five but um I may vote for
 
01:08:09.309 --> 01:08:09.319 align:start position:0%
the five I'm still really thinking of it
 
01:08:10.589 --> 01:08:10.599 align:start position:0%
because I think we can work with a
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
reduced number of magistrates because I
 
01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
think the bail Commissioners once they
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
receive training will be able to do more
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.789 --> 01:08:22.799 align:start position:0%
adequately yeah I'm so um Can somebody
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
remind me um what the cost is for the
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
magistrates and what the difference
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
between five mostly I want to know what
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
the difference between five and 10 is
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman based on the fiscal
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
note 15 and dividing it's
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
156,000 per
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
magistrate and five would cost you
 
01:08:47.759 --> 01:08:50.030 align:start position:0%
magistrate and five would cost you
$781,000

01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
$781,000
 
01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
1.4 and then you'd double that for 10
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
arithmetic could you do the arithmetic
 
01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
and 10 would be double that just under
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
1.5 million or just yeah just under 1.5
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
million so it's 780 versus
 
01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:26.829 align:start position:0%
million so it's 780 versus
1.5

01:09:26.829 --> 01:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
right yes I
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
mean this is the public safe so this is
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I really think this is the place
 
01:09:37.789 --> 01:09:37.799 align:start position:0%
we should be looking but I'm so like
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
respectful of all the work that has been
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
done by the policy committees and chair
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
Roy in particular I feel like we're
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
interposing our opinion on how to best
 
01:09:53.709 --> 01:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
make this system work and support Public
 
01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
Safety and I would go along with 10 I
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
cut yeah overall yeah you're right
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney do you have any
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
further suggestions on your five or no I
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
I would just say I think with firm on
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
five I'm firm on five I think with the
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
case load that's presented for these
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
magistrates under the bail system
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
they're looking at five to six cases a
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
week on bail uh that frees up they still
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
have time to work on other projects and
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
other cases for the judicial branch as
 
01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch sees fit it's a they
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
may use them it's not a sh you know they
 
01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
use them as they see fit um so I think
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
five is a good place to start at again
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
we could be back here a year from now or
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
two years from now and they say we need
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
10 we need seven and we can build up
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
from that five once you have a position
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
you don't skip we don't scale it back so
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
five is I think the place to start from
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
um and five is bigger than zero so
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
infinitely infinitely representative
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
Griffin well I I I think I've already
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
Express and I'm not real supportive of
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
the uh magistrates but I think five is a
 
01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.830 align:start position:0%
the uh magistrates but I think five is a
reasonable

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
compromise okay when the clerk is ready
 
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
please call the role okay on this
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
Sweeney amendment to reduce the number
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
from 15 to five magistrates seconded by
 
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell so I'm just
 
01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out we don't I don't
 
01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
have an amendment number no we just if
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
this passes an amendment with a number
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
the while she's writing out the motion
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
I've been certainly torn we are creating
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
a a new system we're going to try to
 
01:11:59.390 --> 01:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
make it better I think the work that was
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
done by the criminal justice committee
 
01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
and the house Judiciary Committee was
 
01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:04.910 align:start position:0%
and the house Judiciary Committee was
very

01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:12:08.110 --> 01:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
commendable um if we went with some of
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
the options we've discussed today no
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates I think that would be a huge
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
step backwards so I I'm very torn but I
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
think I will support the reduction down
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
to five because it gets us started so at
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
least it gets us started could I ask um
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman can you just tell me
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
I think it would be best if we
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
identified uh the bill number and the
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
line and the
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
page I think it's Senate Bill 252 right
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
magistrates and 240 it's a little bit
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
confusing 249 establishes the
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
magistrates um subject to appropriation
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
which is in the other bill and the
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation is in the other bill so I
 
01:12:57.629 --> 01:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
believe on the first page of this we can
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
amend 15 down
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
to five then figure and elsewhere I'll
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
do the same thing and these will all
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
eventually be drafted as an amendment to
 
01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
so okay um representative Maguire yes
 
01:13:21.239 --> 01:13:22.910 align:start position:0%
so okay um representative Maguire yes
representative

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin yes representative swe
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative cambrell yes chair
 
01:13:36.030 --> 01:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
Wier left okay clerk votes no uh
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
Representative walner no representative
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
grassie yes okay the motion carries and
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
leean has already
 
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
leean has already
yes

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
yes okay one two three four five six to
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
two the motion passes
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right do we want to take a
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
little break from this 318 and go to the
 
01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
next bill since we probably it's really
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
quick I think they're here they're all
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
here yeah waiting for us and I I just
 
01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:12.590 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendment I think the sponsors
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
are um Melissa do you have a Amendment
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:32.189 --> 01:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
so we are now going to House Bill 5 1577
 
01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
you so as soon as
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
represent representative Maguire as soon
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
as Melissa's finished handing things up
 
01:14:59.070 --> 01:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay so um as you you may recall this is
 
01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:02.080 align:start position:0%
the bill that said for the new Mach new
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
voting machines that have uh that do
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
scans of of the ballots and store those
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
scans on internal memory cards the uh
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
the bill was to
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
um allow those scans to be seen by the
 
01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
public and so the way the bill was
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
originally written is that is that the
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would have an
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
employee to to um arrange viewings of
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
these of these scans and so the cost of
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
it was that employee right so there'd be
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
a there'd be a person and in general
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
what we found out was the the memory
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
cards are not stored by the secretary of
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
state they're stored by the towns and
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
they belong to the towns and and that
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
sort of thing so uh what this amendment
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
does does is uh El essentially
 
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
eliminates the cost it it um keeps the
 
01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
memory cards where they are now which is
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
with the towns and it allows um it it
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
requires the towns to sell uh memory
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
cards for their cost uh to people who
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
are who are interested so um all of this
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
viewing and and look at the cards and
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
all that stuff happens after the
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
election eltion is already finalized so
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's not about changing election results
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's just a a
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
matter of interest in in viewing the um
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh viewing these images and the other
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
data on the memory cards so that's what
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
the bill does other questions for
 
01:16:45.679 --> 01:16:46.950 align:start position:0%
the bill does other questions for
representative

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire I have representative able thank
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
you how does this answer the concern
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
expressed by the by Aaron Hennessy
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
concerning um accessible ballots and the
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
Privacy issue right so this does not um
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
address that issue it's um all ballots
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
are are essentially viewable during
 
01:17:17.629 --> 01:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
recounts and um all ballots would be
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
viewable by the original bill so the
 
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
original Bill anybody could come in and
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
say I want to see all the ballots and
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
and they would they would be viewed so
 
01:17:29.550 --> 01:17:29.560 align:start position:0%
that question has sort of already been
 
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
bill so from my notes I see here that
 
01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
this original bill came out of the
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
election law committee without
 
01:17:43.990 --> 01:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations so there was obviously
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
some disagreement there have you talked
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
to anybody on Election law or the chair
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
um I've talked to uh representative wood
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
and obviously the the the sponsor here
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they were both um in favor of this I
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
anything you're good if you're if you're
 
01:18:08.669 --> 01:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
okay so but I did not speak to
 
01:18:08.679 --> 01:18:11.350 align:start position:0%
okay so but I did not speak to
representative

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
Barry any further discussion are you
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
moving your I'm sorry representative eil
 
01:18:19.189 --> 01:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
all I was going to say is I did review
 
01:18:21.310 --> 01:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
um some of the background on this it did
 
01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
come without recommendation um the con
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
concerns that were expressed during that
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and plus when we had the
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State there don't seem to
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
be answered to me so I would have I'm G
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
to have problem with the bill either way
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
I I think I could uh go ahead and
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.470 align:start position:0%

you Mr chair I just like to make the
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
comment that since uh representative
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire's amendment has removed the the
 
01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:26.149 align:start position:0%
Maguire's amendment has removed the the
fiscal

01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%

look at it from a fiscal point of view
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so um I I think that that's a great
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%

no okay we have a few minutes
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
before our 11:30 we like to bounce back
 
01:21:15.719 --> 01:21:18.350 align:start position:0%
before our 11:30 we like to bounce back
to

01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
discuss B reform representative mire you
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
have some amendments um around so I
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
guess we decided on the magistrates
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
issue right we did so the other two were
 
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
the the monitoring and the 1.7 million
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
which I guess you wanted to delay so the
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
monitoring by by counties I think we
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
have an amendment yeah you have an
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
amendment saw county is picking up the
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
yeah who would be the person to speak on
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of the counties whether they have
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
a view or not I don't
 
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
a view or not I don't
know

01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't see currently doing it I oh
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true spoke to my County you
 
01:22:02.590 --> 01:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
know jail and the Commissioners they
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
would prefer that we not uh get involved
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
in the work that they do um you know
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's one of one of the concerns that
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
they had was that if we were set a cap
 
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
on the uh on on the the cost of the
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
monitors or what we what they charged
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
the prisoners or the people that were
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
out on bail for the monitors is that
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
they could lose money on them and they
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
basically make enough to cover the cost
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh I know some some counties roll it
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
into their County cost and so the
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pick it up but in straford
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
county in particular the the person on
 
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:36.639 align:start position:0%
bail actually pays the um or on that
 
01:22:39.510 --> 01:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
been paroled actually pays the cost they
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh they don't do it any other way and so
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
they they don't want any restriction on
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
that but they've been doing it and they
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
have it all set up to do it so that's
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
not a it's not an issue as long as you
 
01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:51.639 align:start position:0%
don't interfere with
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
it representative McGuire would you like
 
01:22:56.030 --> 01:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
to explain your Amendment
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
please yeah I I think this may be the
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
first time I've seen it but but what I
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
asked for was um again just to switch
 
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
the the monitoring function from from
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
these um the courts to the counties um
 
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
and and um essentially require them to
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
do what some of the counties are are
 
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
already doing um I I think we want to
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
retain the the bus business of if if
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
people are
 
01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:29.030 align:start position:0%
people are
Indigent

01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
Indigent
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
um and and maybe we would have to pick
 
01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
up we the state would have to pick up
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
that cost rather than uh the county
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
picking up the cost and I I doubt that's
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
written I see on the second page it says
 
01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
the court May reimburse yeah right at
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
the top it says a court May re May order
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of the cost of monitor to
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
the county in cour ordance with the
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
provisions okay so I think that that's
 
01:23:59.310 --> 01:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
but it would be the court that would
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
make that decision right well the court
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
is effectively the state
 
01:24:07.750 --> 01:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that works Erin would you have
 
01:24:12.830 --> 01:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
question uh I would just like to uh
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
really commend representative McGuire
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
you did so much work and research with
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
uh so many parties and I think that this
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
is a very useful um addition to the
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
package that will really help delate
 
01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
some of the responsibilities that some
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
of the parts of the Criminal Justice
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
System have so I just appreciate all of
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
that groundw work and I think that this
 
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.109 --> 01:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
helpful president
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
Griffin I'd like to ask
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
um I I see a problem here depending upon
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
the effective
 
01:24:57.709 --> 01:24:57.719 align:start position:0%
date because uh you require ing a 24hour
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
review and uh we we don't have the
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
magistrates in place so what when would
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
effective well let's get out the how it
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
252 although again we're we're planning
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
to to rewrite this as as House Bill 318
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
and it'll have an effective dat section
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
then presumably if there was an issue
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
there this section could be effective
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2025 yeah that's when
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.070 --> 01:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
effective but yeah if you want to if you
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
want to put in into the final bill that
 
01:25:46.109 --> 01:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
the magistrates can be hired
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
immediately and and these kind of
 
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
sections take place January 1st I think
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
that to be yeah okay that makes sense
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
immediately I'm just suggesting that you
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
be careful well I mean the part about
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
hiring magistrates could be on passage
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
right and
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
so you know and the same thing with
 
01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
coordinator Mr
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
Hoffman I I expect that after the
 
01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
committee goes through all all three
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
bills then
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
um you would revisit all the effective
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
dates um to make sure that everything
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
aligns so maybe after all the amendments
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
are approved and adopted and we can go
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
back and look at the effective dates
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
consider are you okay with that yeah
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
represent Sweeny shman I saw Kate Horgan
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
from the County Association came in I
 
01:26:55.149 --> 01:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to bring her up
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
speed on how this impacts the counties
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
sorry to put you on the spot
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
K so thank you if you could just
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
identify yourself because we're just
 
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:05.550 align:start position:0%
about ready to pass on all these costs
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:07.350 align:start position:0%
about ready to pass on all these costs
[Laughter]

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
for thank you representative bman and
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
to representive Sweeney for giving me a
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
a text message I sprinted over from the
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
state house so I apologize for being a
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
little out of breath um I did talk to
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire about this
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
amendment yesterday we would draw your
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
attention to page two lines 9 through
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
18 the way I am reading this it would
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
cause an administrative nightmare for
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
the association of counties and county
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
government um so it says if a court
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
finds a person is Indigent for repaying
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
the is not Indigent the court will order
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
shall order them to reimburse the county
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the payment unless that
 
01:27:50.109 --> 01:27:50.119 align:start position:0%
person's case terminates without a
 
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
conviction for any
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
offense that means unless someone is
 
01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
found guilty you we can't be reimbursed
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
for anything regards to electronic
 
01:28:03.870 --> 01:28:03.880 align:start position:0%
monitoring not specifically just the
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
electronic monitoring that is posted
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
previously in this bill and the amount
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
of work that it would take to try and
 
01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
find these people to get that
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement after they are released we
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
never getting paid back for anything and
 
01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
this language we believe would be an
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate on the counties
 
01:28:28.910 --> 01:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
okay so I will respond to that so um I
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
think in general and maybe um Judge Lynn
 
01:28:33.149 --> 01:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
would like
 
01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:37.710 align:start position:0%
to agree or not agree but in general we
 
01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.070 align:start position:0%
to agree or not agree but in general we
[Music]

01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
um it's okay to charge people who are
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
accused um when they're not Indigent
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
right so so in the sense that they pay
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
for their attorney they pay for all
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
kinds of costs right so so this
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
particular line maybe could simply be
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
struck I mean this this unless so on
 
01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
right because because
 
01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.350 align:start position:0%
right because because
essentially

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
um there's there's no sort of legal
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
reason that that everybody has to be
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
made whole on all their costs when
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're accused of a crime go through
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
the whole process um that that would
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
certainly make us happier okay and I
 
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
think um it would uh you would probably
 
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
to cross out the next line too that
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
include could we get your name again
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
please for the record Kate Horan h o r g
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
an and what I will suggest is you and
 
01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire get together and
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
work out some language that will satisfy
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
the County's concerns I would be happy
 
01:29:49.950 --> 01:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
to thank you thank
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
you miss all right we're almost to 11
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
almost to 11:30 so we can bounce the
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
next one you're okay with getting
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
that veterans court I think we have an
 
01:30:07.709 --> 01:30:07.719 align:start position:0%
amendment for that so next on our agenda
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
is House Bill 1589 stablishing a
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
veterans treatment Court representative
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire you have an amendment
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
I so we're going to name you Mr
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's fine with me so um
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
like's cutting trees down yeah
 
01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
all right anyways um if you remember
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
this bill it just had a straight uh $2
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
million a year cost uh for veterans
 
01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
court in the and the way it it divided
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
that cost was just straight C payments
 
01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
that cost was just straight C payments
to

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
counties um to implement the veterans
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
court and it was it was so much to
 
01:30:47.149 --> 01:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County and so much to
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and so on down the
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
list and
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
um so whereas the numbers we were
 
01:30:59.109 --> 01:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
hearing about the number of cases were
 
01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.719 align:start position:0%
were you know kind of in the low double
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
digits or something you know annually I
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
mean it it
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't like a lot of cases and so $2
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
million every year for you know what
 
01:31:15.669 --> 01:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
sounded like 40 or 50 cases was was too
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
much so um what we talked about and
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
what's in this amendment is to instead
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
have the payments to the counties be
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
$5,000 a case up to the number that was
 
01:31:33.750 --> 01:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
originally in the bill right so so my
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
estimate I think our estimate was that
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
this would reduce the 2 million to maybe
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
more like
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
300,000 it says 245,000 ought to exceed
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
per year right but I think that's for a
 
01:31:49.390 --> 01:31:49.400 align:start position:0%
particular County that's size County
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
there's three different standards for
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
right so so those are the numbers that
 
01:31:55.629 --> 01:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
we're in the bill originally right the
 
01:32:00.350 --> 01:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
245 the 150 and the 100 I think those
 
01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
were or maybe it was even more than that
 
01:32:06.030 --> 01:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
question represent grassy what we're
 
01:32:08.669 --> 01:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
looking at here in this is it said up to
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
so a county who is a Louge County they
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
would not be able to get more than
 
01:32:14.790 --> 01:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to set up their veterans court
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
and a medium County wouldn't be able to
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
get more than
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
$150,000 for setting up their Court a
 
01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
small County wouldn't be able to get
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
more than a 100,000 I'd like to see
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
Which counties those were um to you know
 
01:32:28.270 --> 01:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
who fits into what what's considered a
 
01:32:30.189 --> 01:32:30.199 align:start position:0%
large what's considered a medium County
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
if we could get that breakdown it on
 
01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:35.560 align:start position:0%
line 20 oh okay I'm sorry I was looking
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.159 --> 01:32:41.790 align:start position:0%
 
side

01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
side
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
okay and I think those are unchanged so
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
in other words my County would get 250
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
could could get up to $250,000
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
$245,000 for setting up their Court
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
have you had a chance to discuss this
 
01:32:59.470 --> 01:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
with our friends at the National
 
01:33:01.669 --> 01:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
Guard National
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
Guard uh
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
no no but they were here he's here now
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I thought maybe we could
 
01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay I mean he's the one of the source
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:18.830 --> 01:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
numbers so for the record Warren Perry
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
Deputy agent General New Hampshire's
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
Department of military Affairs and
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
veteran services so again I can't get to
 
01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
the cost or how the costing would work I
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not I'm not an expert in the
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
court system or court costs I can really
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
just reiterate what we believe the
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
demand would be on this veteran court
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
system and you know based on numbers
 
01:33:39.790 --> 01:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
that we were able to glean from the past
 
01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
we think you know the big the best
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
estimate we have is about 27 a year
 
01:33:47.229 --> 01:33:47.239 align:start position:0%
across the state and then we inflated
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
those numbers a little bit to up to
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
about 40 so that we would just make sure
 
01:33:52.590 --> 01:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
we covered the cost of what's going on
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
but still not a tremend mendous Demand
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
on the system right so that's that's
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
kind of you mean that's that's where I'm
 
01:34:01.750 --> 01:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
at uh so with regard to the amendment I
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
I don't think I could comment directly
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
on the impact of cost I think that's
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that the judicial system and
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections would be
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
better suited to talk about in terms of
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
cost I apologize for just not being an
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
expert in the money piece no problem are
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
there any
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
questions singan thanks for being
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
here all right the division's pleasure
 
01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:24.430 align:start position:0%
here all right the division's pleasure
with

01:34:24.430 --> 01:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:34:28.109 --> 01:34:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
1277 representative grassy oh I'm sorry
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
first with Aaron about this the only
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
question I have
 
01:34:41.239 --> 01:34:42.870 align:start position:0%
question I have
is

01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
um it's not clear to me how in other
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
words if a if a county wants to apply
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
grant um it's not
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
they may not know how many cases they're
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
going to have in the in applying so I'm
 
01:35:01.870 --> 01:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
that's my guess I I guess I'm just
 
01:35:04.470 --> 01:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
wondering about the the mechanics of
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
this how What You Know The Envision
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
envisioning how this is going to work if
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
the if Hillsboro County is going to
 
01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
apply for a grant um you know how how
 
01:35:18.430 --> 01:35:18.440 align:start position:0%
are they going to know what they're uh
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
should should there be some language
 
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
that says they may you know this will be
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
based on the prior year
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
or uh you know that that's my only
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
concern yeah I would agree with this and
 
01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
and um basically this language is
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
unchanged from the bill when it was a
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
grant but I think it should be more of a
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know reimburse the
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
counties annually or quarterly or
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever is to a Max up to this maximum
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
per year you know something like that so
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
we we can work on changing that that
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
would be that would be that would make
 
01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to do that and can I can I
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
just ask one other question just to make
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
sure the the section the the first Roman
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
numeral one the the first amend RSA 490
 
01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:06.229 align:start position:0%
numeral one the the first amend RSA 490
colon

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:36:08.590 --> 01:36:08.600 align:start position:0%
i-11 that first paragraph of the
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
amendment is that is that just is that a
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
change or is that just it seemed like it
 
01:36:16.709 --> 01:36:16.719 align:start position:0%
was very close if to the original Bill
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if there was
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
actually any change at all this is this
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
is a sh to
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
May um so if you remember oh
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
oh no I'm sorry I that that's fine I was
 
01:36:33.990 --> 01:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
it is a CH that's that is airly
 
01:36:36.669 --> 01:36:36.679 align:start position:0%
significant change right so we're
 
01:36:36.679 --> 01:36:38.430 align:start position:0%
significant change right so we're
allowing

01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
um we're allowing counties to implement
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
veterans courts not forcing them to Sor
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
and and we're um we're giving them a
 
01:36:50.669 --> 01:36:50.679 align:start position:0%
little carrot which is the
 
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
$5,000 right so that's the no that makes
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
sense good I have no problem with that I
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
think I recall you being in here and
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
discussing the sh May issue on this well
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
you know what I was thinking of the Shel
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
May issue on the training the judge's
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
training that's what I was yeah that's
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
what I was I know you don't like shell
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
no no no no no I do I actually do like
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
shell I I think it's uh it's some other
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
people maybe I was just kidding
 
01:37:19.629 --> 01:37:19.639 align:start position:0%
represented grassy yeah looking at this
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
and if and particularly if we put it in
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
as a reimbursement I think would
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
probably be a better way to go but the
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
thing is is that based on the size of
 
01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
the counties that you have here this
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
could cost us up to $3 million just shy
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
of 3 million it's
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
2.95 so if everybody maxed out their
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursements so represent Willer
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah representative Maguire will
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
get together with the general lady from
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
the county that was behind Mr Hoffman
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
sure try to work this out yeah we can do
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
it yeah all right thanks
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll have an
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
amendment on this with that correction
 
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:03.800 align:start position:0%
Monday we're gonna meet Monday okay good
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
you like meeting Monday works for me is
 
01:38:08.790 --> 01:38:08.800 align:start position:0%
Monday okay with everybody or Tuesday is
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
that the day after
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
I we haven't made it official yet but
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to meet I'm sure got
 
01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
button these things up representing
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
cambrell so you'll okay for a Monday or
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
would you rather have it
 
01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.629 align:start position:0%
would you rather have it
Tuesday

01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%

oh come
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
on 10 o' 10 10 o'clock on Tuesday then
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.639 --> 01:38:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
close

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
yous no actually represent
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
W so do we want to go back and discuss
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
any more on 318 represent McGuire
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
because you do have another amendment
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
right um 318 or 249 or
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.870 --> 01:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
delay we haven't done
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
105 were just Bas that yeah so 105 well
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to merge it into 318 I think
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
the other we yes I think I think there
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
is one so represent Maguire has an
 
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
amendment on 1
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
005 we'll pass out since we have a
 
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
here you stay pretty
 
01:39:36.189 --> 01:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
busy I'm burning the candle at both ends
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.990 align:start position:0%
 
burned

01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
burned
 
01:40:03.629 --> 01:40:03.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
on all right he representative Maguire
 
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
has an amendment
 
01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
1113 on
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
10:05 all right so some of this um there
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
may be people objecting but the main the
 
01:40:19.199 --> 01:40:20.430 align:start position:0%
may be people objecting but the main the
main

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:20.440 align:start position:0%
main
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
thing this was in response to um what we
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
heard from the
 
01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
Judiciary about
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
um how effective this would be right we
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
heard that they wanted a Judicial
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
training coordinator but that the
 
01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
details they wanted left up to them so
 
01:40:44.350 --> 01:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
so this one cut out the original Bill
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
had a significant you know prescriptive
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
inspection said you know this kind of
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:58.990 --> 01:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
trains so and so this cuts out except
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
for new judges those kind of
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
restriction and the other thing it also
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
does is it it has the training
 
01:41:16.109 --> 01:41:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
train so that um bail Commissioners are
 
01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
adequately trained and it keeps the
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
original remember we had talked about
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
moving this to the end of the the next
 
01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
days

01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
all representative Lynn I see this came
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
out of your committee like uh 18 to one
 
01:41:52.550 --> 01:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
are you any comments on the amendment or
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment so this bill was actually
 
01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
based on a lot of testimony that we
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
received uh sorry for the record
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
representative Caitlyn cab um on a lot
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
of testimony we received in the special
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the family court and I
 
01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
think it really is important to leave
 
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:21.960 align:start position:0%
the number of hours in here because they
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
already were supposed to doing it by
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
Court rule and it's just been on the
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
back burner because it's not required I
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
think it's really important that we do
 
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
require a number of hours we had lots of
 
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
testimony regarding this it was
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
basically the priority bill that came
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
out of that committee so um I really do
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
do think that it's important that we put
 
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
that back in and um I'll let
 
01:42:45.589 --> 01:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn speak to it but he
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything wrong with saying
 
01:42:50.830 --> 01:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
shell do this specific number of hours
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
and so that was why the committee had
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
changed from May to
 
01:42:58.990 --> 01:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
Shell so you like the amendment I don't
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
like this no I don't like the amendment
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
because it's taking out the number of
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
hours sorry I why I want to make it
 
01:43:05.950 --> 01:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
clear I'm fine with putting in like it's
 
01:43:07.990 --> 01:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
interesting because with the bail
 
01:43:09.830 --> 01:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners were prescribing a certain
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
number of hours but then with our judges
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're not I mean we our judges should be
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
more trained than our bail
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners but I'll let judge
 
01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:21.639 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I think has a
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
question for you thank yes thanks for
 
01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.830 align:start position:0%
question for you thank yes thanks for
coming

01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
um one thing that you didn't have with
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
the hours is the concept that a new
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
judge needs more hours of training than
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been in 10 years 20 years
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
something like that do you because it
 
01:43:41.950 --> 01:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
had a flat number for every judge for
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
every year does that still make sense to
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
you or or not so it it it did have a
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
difference because it did state that it
 
01:43:50.669 --> 01:43:50.679 align:start position:0%
in the beginning like you'd complete an
 
01:43:52.669 --> 01:43:52.679 align:start position:0%
orientation and then after that it was a
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
certain number of hours per year
 
01:43:58.350 --> 01:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
and if
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
you think of it in the context of I
 
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
mean the number of hours that were in
 
01:44:06.910 --> 01:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
there was 16 hours or something like
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't really think it's that much
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
when you consider that a doctor does a
 
01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:11.800 align:start position:0%
100 hours you know every two years I
 
01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
mean I just I think our judges should be
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
as educated as as other professions they
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
don't have to do the number a certain
 
01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
number of hours as required by the bar
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
anymore when they're judges either so
 
01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
um I think it's just important that
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
there so the number of hours on there
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
was 24 hours um for judges and it
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
was 16 hours for the superior court
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
clerks and uh 12 hours for the circuit
 
01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.149 align:start position:0%
clerks and uh 12 hours for the circuit
court

01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:44:46.070 --> 01:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
clerks and the number of hours for the
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
orientation wasn't specific in here it
 
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
just said that they had to complete it
 
01:44:53.350 --> 01:44:53.360 align:start position:0%
within 3 months but then after that was
 
01:44:55.310 --> 01:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
like kind of the continuing education
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
requirement in there it's not changing
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
the impact of the fiscal Noe or not
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
because it's still providing the
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
training coordinator and what we are
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
told with the training coordinator is is
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
well they can kind of a lot of times
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
arrange to bring somebody in or or you
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
know to conduct these trainings rather
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
than send people off to conferences and
 
01:45:14.189 --> 01:45:14.199 align:start position:0%
whatnot that might cost a lot more money
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
but I still think that it is important
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
that the whole purpose is to make sure
 
01:45:19.790 --> 01:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
that our our judges are trained and not
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
just to put it on the back burner so I
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it makes sense to give them
 
01:45:23.629 --> 01:45:23.639 align:start position:0%
the money for the training coordinator
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
position but then not actually require
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
that they do the training I mean that
 
01:45:28.830 --> 01:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
completely def defeats the purpose of
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
the bill okay I don't I don't have a
 
01:45:33.629 --> 01:45:33.639 align:start position:0%
strong objection so I we could put those
 
01:45:35.589 --> 01:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
things back in that's
 
01:45:39.589 --> 01:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Lynn the only the
 
01:45:45.550 --> 01:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
only thing I want to say and I um here
 
01:45:49.629 --> 01:45:49.639 align:start position:0%
is that uh apparently there had been
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
some suggestion that um to have the more
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
detailed thing in somehow violated
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
separation of powers um respect I don't
 
01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:02.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure who said that but I
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
remember you know for I I have the
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
greatest respect for you all may
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
remember hoe zibble uh who used to be
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
our uh legal counsel um frequently he
 
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
would come over here and make that kind
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
of an argument and with great respect
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
for Howie who I I I love dearly
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um it's baloney it has no it had stop
 
01:46:30.030 --> 01:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
and think about this the argument always
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
was you can't tell another branch of
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
government um uh how to how to do this
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
and whenever that argument is made you
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
have to ask yourself well if we can't
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
tell another branch of government to do
 
01:46:46.629 --> 01:46:46.639 align:start position:0%
this we the legislature okay let's
 
01:46:48.109 --> 01:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
assume that's true then that means you
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
can't tell the executive branch to do
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
this either but as representative she
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
didn't really reference this in her in
 
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
in what she just said but U if you look
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
in the executive and the laws we have
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
dealing with the executive branch we
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
tell them what kind of training and all
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things we say you have to
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
have you know somebody to fill this
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
position has to have this kind of
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
training or this kind of there's no
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
there's no Prov no problem at all with
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
doing that um it doesn't in any way
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
interfere with the judiciary's
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
independent Independence in terms of
 
01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
making decisions it doesn't tell them in
 
01:47:26.830 --> 01:47:26.840 align:start position:0%
any way this is how you should decide
 
01:47:29.270 --> 01:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
this case or that it's has nothing to do
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
with that it's just um it's just saying
 
01:47:35.709 --> 01:47:35.719 align:start position:0%
judges have to have certain training and
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know that I don't see any problem
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
at all with that and I think for the
 
01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
reasons that uh representative couta
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out it it does seem like it
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense to say um you know
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
particularly given that you're going to
 
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
have the training coordinator it does
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
really make sense to say this these are
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
the kind kind of things that the
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
training should deal with and I I so I I
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
I strongly support that
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
idea so um what I think people making
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
that argument would say is well in the
 
01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
case of the courts we have in the
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution part two article
 
01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
73a which says the the Chief Justice
 
01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:16.199 align:start position:0%
shall be the administrative head of all
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
the courts he shall make rules governing
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
administration of all courts and
 
01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
practice and procedure followed in all
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
courts and these rules shall have the
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
force and effec of law right so um does
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
that no do I don't think there's
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
something equivalent for the governor
 
01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
for example with regard to his powers
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
you see I mean with regard I'm sorry my
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
recollection is that was added after
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
what was voted on as a constitutional
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
amendment they the such things shall
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
have the power of law was not in what
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
was approved by the voters I see
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
somebody just decided to add it and it
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
was illegal that's what my friend
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
U would tell me all the time Bill
 
01:49:04.790 --> 01:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
Gardner what's that I is it up to Bill
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
Gardner maybe anyway I know I I I I
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
think the short answer is that does not
 
01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
I I that does not in fact there was a
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
this was the subject of a long long
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
debate of you know 20 20 years ago or so
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
um and and in fact the the Supreme Court
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
actually wrote a decision subsequent to
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
that debate basically saying that the
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
legislature has the power to make uh to
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
to affect sort of Court procedure as
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
long as it doesn't interfere with the
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
essential adjudicatory functions of the
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
Court this kind of thing does not and so
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh um that
 
01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
that's it was Mar told me
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
that added the language later
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
um so are you clear representative
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire what needs to be done yeah I
 
01:50:00.310 --> 01:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
think so so Mike will we'll put back in
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
a this is uh going to be my third time
 
01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
putting myself at Peril disagreeing with
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
not only a former Chief Justice of the
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but the chair of the house
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee and a very very good
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer um I with one of the things that
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
I did and take before I took this job I
 
01:50:25.629 --> 01:50:25.639 align:start position:0%
read an extensive Corpus of law on
 
01:50:25.639 --> 01:50:26.550 align:start position:0%
read an extensive Corpus of law on
article

01:50:26.550 --> 01:50:26.560 align:start position:0%
article
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
73a and his influence is throughout that
 
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
body of law a very influential Bar
 
01:50:34.030 --> 01:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
review article he wrote cases that he
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
adjudicated I completely understand his
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
perspective um but the but the body of
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
law that
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
has co-existing Authority between the
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and the judicial branch is
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence it is the rules of
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
procedure it is not the internal
 
01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
administration of the court system that
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
is a separate Clause of 73a and it is
 
01:50:57.510 --> 01:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
what most people understand as the
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
independence of the Judiciary the idea
 
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
that there is something different about
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and that it is still the
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
standing law on the books in the state
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that the uh legislature
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
can't determine the discipline of the
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
judicial branch uh I don't know how it
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
could be the law that the legislature
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
can't determine internal discipline but
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
they can determine training those are
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
essentially two halves of the same
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
administrative Personnel uh
 
01:51:27.310 --> 01:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
Administration that are to the heart of
 
01:51:28.830 --> 01:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
what it means to administer the
 
01:51:30.990 --> 01:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I'm not saying this in any way
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
to challenge the power of the
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
legislature over the Judiciary which is
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
vast the legislature can abolish a court
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
it can create new judgeships it can
 
01:51:42.629 --> 01:51:42.639 align:start position:0%
raise the it create new causes of action
 
01:51:43.950 --> 01:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
it could lower the maximum punishment
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
for murder to a year the power that the
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislature has is very very vast the
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
narrow area of self Administration and
 
01:51:53.470 --> 01:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
Independence is so small small and there
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
is a lot of danger I know that the bill
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
that um rep Lyn and rep cutab worked on
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
who are both excellent legislators who
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
coordinate very closely with the
 
01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
legislature and do things that are
 
01:52:05.229 --> 01:52:05.239 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful to the branch um and
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
this this argument that there should be
 
01:52:08.390 --> 01:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
a Judicial training coordinator is
 
01:52:10.229 --> 01:52:10.239 align:start position:0%
perceptive it's not an idea that we came
 
01:52:12.030 --> 01:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
up with it's an idea that rep kutab came
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
up with and I think it's a very very
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
smart idea um but the danger that's not
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill but is contained in the
 
01:52:20.069 --> 01:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
idea that the legislature can regulate
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
this area is that you can overcome
 
01:52:24.669 --> 01:52:24.679 align:start position:0%
something that's not in the law by
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
forcing judges to be trained in it force
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
them with a presumption that a case
 
01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
should be decided a certain way um that
 
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.800 align:start position:0%
that's not here but that's why training
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
is not closely regulated by another
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
branch of government the Judiciary has
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
to be independent in its determination
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
of cases based on the law um so I I
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate the idea to have a Judicial
 
01:52:45.709 --> 01:52:45.719 align:start position:0%
training coordinator which as I said is
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
excellent um the advice that I
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
originally gave rep kutab was to Simply
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
take her recommendations and change her
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
shs to maze because the Judiciary will
 
01:52:57.790 --> 01:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
listen with respect when the legislature
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
speaks when they say we it is our
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion to you that you have this
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
number of hours or these topics we will
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
listen with respect whether that is
 
01:53:06.669 --> 01:53:06.679 align:start position:0%
verbal whether that is in a hearing
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
whether it is in a statute but if it is
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
a shall then the statute is I believe
 
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional um so I would I would
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
ask that the advice be given from the
 
01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
legislature in a form that is
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional this is something that is
 
01:53:21.550 --> 01:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
you know as you say it's been maintained
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
from the times of how he's it appears in
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
numerous other laws for example our
 
01:53:28.030 --> 01:53:28.040 align:start position:0%
training of our court security officers
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
we can certify them under executive
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
standards if the Supreme Court uh chief
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
justice allows so we language like this
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
appears in many other bills and laws in
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
order to ensure that they are
 
01:53:39.629 --> 01:53:39.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional if it's not
 
01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:41.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional it may be collaterally
 
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
attacked in litigation the person who's
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
being required to do the training can
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
say that the law is unconstitutional and
 
01:53:49.149 --> 01:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
that they're not required to do it and
 
01:53:51.390 --> 01:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
they'd very likely be victorious if it
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
is in May and the Chief Justice
 
01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
implements it his independent action is
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional and protects the
 
01:54:00.629 --> 01:54:00.639 align:start position:0%
requirement uh so I I understand the
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
arguments that are being made and I just
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
and I disagree at my Peril but I I
 
01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
simply have to maintain this argument I
 
01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
think it is very important that the
 
01:54:11.550 --> 01:54:11.560 align:start position:0%
Judiciary has this narrow area of self-
 
01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
administration so that we can maintain
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
our independence but that is not in any
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
way a suggestion that we would not
 
01:54:19.149 --> 01:54:19.159 align:start position:0%
follow the recommendations that we
 
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
received in a we would listen with
 
01:54:24.669 --> 01:54:24.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
so I see the word shell all throughout
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment and that's got got you on
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
your head I guess I and I I I think what
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
um what is in the original bill was Mays
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
it was converted in committee to shells
 
01:54:39.069 --> 01:54:39.079 align:start position:0%
and it was an 181 vote because I
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
persuaded only one person when I argued
 
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
with uh representative Lynn I we went
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
181 he had 18 I had one I think was how
 
01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
that argument went um and it was changed
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
to sha and I see that there are shs in
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
this Amendment but they have as directed
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
by the Chief Justice which is another
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
way that you can preserve the
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the bill because it
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
creates the possibility of a waiver or
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
an adjustment based on administrative
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances so as I read the amendment
 
01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:10.520 align:start position:0%
now and I and I believe you adopted the
 
01:55:11.790 --> 01:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
first page of this amendment in a
 
01:55:13.149 --> 01:55:13.159 align:start position:0%
previous meeting that you had on this
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
bill I believe that we can Implement
 
01:55:17.830 --> 01:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
that constitutionally um I I don't take
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
a position on whether you add the bail
 
01:55:21.069 --> 01:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
educational requirements to the
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
amendment but the amendment now I
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
believe is constitutional but so also
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
would be an amendment which takes rep
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
kab's original Bill and converts her shs
 
01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.990 align:start position:0%
kab's original Bill and converts her shs
to

01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
ma it certainly doesn't seem like it's a
 
01:55:37.069 --> 01:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
terribly onerous one hour of training to
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
look at ethics and other things you know
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
we have we absolutely have the ability
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
to implement this I think I mentioned
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
when I last spoke on it we we well
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
exceed these requirements I I believe
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative kutab does a great deal
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
of research um in in the bills that she
 
01:55:53.310 --> 01:55:53.320 align:start position:0%
proposes and spoke to us about our
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
existing training requirements so her
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
suggestions I had understood Were Meant
 
01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
to uh Implement some of the things that
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
we already do uh you know our hours
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
requirements are typically much higher
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
and these are all topics that we
 
01:56:04.119 --> 01:56:05.950 align:start position:0%
and these are all topics that we
currently

01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
cover further questions for Aaron seeing
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
none the uh division would like to act
 
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:16.040 align:start position:0%
on the amendment or you all we all
 
01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I'd like to point
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
out that we uh we just voted an
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to uh create the
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
magistrates and I don't see the word
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
magistrate in here anywhere shouldn't
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
they be getting the same training as a
 
01:56:31.639 --> 01:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
they be getting the same training as a
bail

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.229 align:start position:0%
 
commissioner

01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
yeah um so
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there they're
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
considered a court staff or or not I
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
113 judges comma magistrates comma bail
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
Commissioners comma administrators comma
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
staff all right we'll get a corrected
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment shortly now I'm unclear on
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not you be changing any of
 
01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
these shells to maze or should we vote
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
sure absolutely you're very much
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
involved with this bill so we'd like to
 
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
things uh so the training coordinator
 
01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't my idea it came from a a
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
meeting with judge king and and some
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
other uh staff members but um the so
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
what she's saying is the initial bill as
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
it was put in not as amended by the
 
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
house which did still say the number of
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
hours was constitutional like where it's
 
01:58:55.310 --> 01:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
where it had the shells because it said
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
under the discretion of the chief
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
justice so if we could at least put in
 
01:59:02.109 --> 01:59:02.119 align:start position:0%
the number of hours to make it match
 
01:59:04.310 --> 01:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
like that original bill and if we don't
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
want it to say
 
01:59:08.589 --> 01:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
the the shell as amended in committee
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's fine but if we could at least put
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
the number of hours back in I do really
 
01:59:16.069 --> 01:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
that I I guess on on you know we keep
 
01:59:21.950 --> 01:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
talking about policy issues right this
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
is is not a financial issue so maybe we
 
01:59:27.229 --> 01:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
should go along with the bill as the as
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
the committee passed it I don't know
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
what do you think well that would be my
 
01:59:34.350 --> 01:59:34.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion but
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean but I think why don't we
 
01:59:39.310 --> 01:59:39.320 align:start position:0%
vote on doing that right all right all
 
01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:41.560 align:start position:0%
right so so I'll propose that we restore
 
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bill to the the way that section of
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
the bill the number of hours and the and
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
leaving the sh to the the way the
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
committee passed them is it seconded
 
01:59:53.119 --> 01:59:55.709 align:start position:0%
committee passed them is it seconded
representative

01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
wer further discussion on that everybody
 
02:00:03.069 --> 02:00:03.079 align:start position:0%
clear did it come from the house as a
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
May or a shall it came as sh as shall
 
02:00:09.950 --> 02:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah May was only in the original
 
02:00:13.030 --> 02:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill that they then amended to
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
sh and so
 
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
basically if we do the shall then we're
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
discounting what the general count
 
02:00:25.069 --> 02:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
just was advising us about yes on the
 
02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill we we are citing with
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn instead of the
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
instead of the general Council of the
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
Jud okay all right I as a all right as a
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer I have I struggle with
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
that all right when the clerk is ready
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
please call the role on representative
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
Maguire's Amendment which was seconded
 
02:00:49.310 --> 02:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
by represent a Wilder okay I thought we
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
would just have an informal vote on this
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
particular issue all we can
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
do yeah you're going to withdraw
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
everything and go back to the
 
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
original no no no because we still want
 
02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.589 align:start position:0%
original no no no because we still want
bail

02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
bail
 
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we want magistrates and
 
02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.790 align:start position:0%
Commissioners we want magistrates and
bail

02:01:05.790 --> 02:01:05.800 align:start position:0%
bail
 
02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
Commissioners well we'll we'll we'll
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
hold off until we clear on what uh
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is going to add

03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
here so good afternoon we'll resume our
 
03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on House Bill
 
03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:48.389 align:start position:0%
discussion on House Bill
1633

03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
1633
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire has an amendment
 
03:07:52.429 --> 03:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
he would like to discuss which the full
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee heard yesterday as a
 
03:07:56.030 --> 03:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
non- gerine
 
03:07:58.510 --> 03:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment so representative
 
03:08:01.870 --> 03:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr chairman so a big
 
03:08:05.870 --> 03:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
decision before we get into more detail
 
03:08:08.910 --> 03:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
is the the overall structure of this
 
03:08:12.030 --> 03:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
bill and that's why we had that nerain
 
03:08:14.190 --> 03:08:14.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment hearing yesterday and so the
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
decision is between the original House
 
03:08:17.600 --> 03:08:19.110 align:start position:0%
decision is between the original House
Bill

03:08:19.110 --> 03:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
1633 and this amendment uh
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
124h and and the main difference in
 
03:08:29.790 --> 03:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
these two structures is one is what they
 
03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
call the agency model and the this one
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
is what they call the franchise model
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
and so it has to do with sort of who's
 
03:08:43.710 --> 03:08:43.720 align:start position:0%
in charge and um who's kind of directing
 
03:08:45.389 --> 03:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
the whole business and that sort of
 
03:08:50.990 --> 03:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
thing um On's one's akin to a bunch of
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
diff individual Rec regulated businesses
 
03:08:57.670 --> 03:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
obviously strongly regulated because of
 
03:09:01.030 --> 03:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
the of the subject matter but the other
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
is more akin to um a master business and
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
a and a bunch of uh um subsidiary
 
03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
franchises and so um we are told from
 
03:09:18.990 --> 03:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
the governor and from um our contacts in
 
03:09:22.670 --> 03:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate that this is what that they
 
03:09:26.190 --> 03:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
want the franchise model uh we are also
 
03:09:29.269 --> 03:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
told they will not vote for the version
 
03:09:32.229 --> 03:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
that the house passed and we are told
 
03:09:32.239 --> 03:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
that the house passed and we are told
that

03:09:34.070 --> 03:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:38.510 --> 03:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
um they are either unwilling or
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
incapable of uh making significant
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
changes in the Senate so um if we want
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
to see a bill pass passed and I'm not
 
03:09:51.950 --> 03:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody does but um for
 
03:09:55.030 --> 03:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
those of us who do um I think we should
 
03:09:58.830 --> 03:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
amendment are there questions for
 
03:10:00.960 --> 03:10:03.750 align:start position:0%
amendment are there questions for
representative

03:10:03.750 --> 03:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.910 --> 03:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:11.710 --> 03:10:11.720 align:start position:0%
Griffin this amendment is very much like
 
03:10:15.190 --> 03:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
the agency amendment in many
 
03:10:20.870 --> 03:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
respects uh and I'm concerned about the
 
03:10:22.550 --> 03:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
division of
 
03:10:26.750 --> 03:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
revenues that are in both the bill and
 
03:10:26.760 --> 03:10:27.870 align:start position:0%
revenues that are in both the bill and
the

03:10:27.870 --> 03:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
amendment if if this amendment were to
 
03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
pass the committee are you prepared to
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment to change the uh
 
03:10:39.550 --> 03:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
03:10:42.670 --> 03:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
revenues the answer is yes so regardless
 
03:10:45.309 --> 03:10:45.319 align:start position:0%
of which one this is this is sort of
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
deciding a base right and then
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
regardless of which base we have then we
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
have a long list of further topics to
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
talk about which would be true of either
 
03:11:00.870 --> 03:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
one right so either one all these things
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
make a difference right so so those will
 
03:11:07.349 --> 03:11:07.359 align:start position:0%
be individual decisions after
 
03:11:10.870 --> 03:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
this represent
 
03:11:13.630 --> 03:11:13.640 align:start position:0%
grassy I we worked on this I'm also on
 
03:11:15.269 --> 03:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee we work tired on
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
this bill for a number of weeks and you
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
know I I just have a problem and I know
 
03:11:21.950 --> 03:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
we've all received a number of emails
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill as well and I think that
 
03:11:25.389 --> 03:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
I need to support what the Commerce
 
03:11:26.830 --> 03:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
Committee came up with with the work
 
03:11:28.269 --> 03:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
that we did there and I think that is
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
the best way to go with the franchise
 
03:11:31.950 --> 03:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
program instead of going with the agency
 
03:11:33.510 --> 03:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
U approach that we have here I mean if
 
03:11:35.269 --> 03:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate has problems with passing a
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
bill I don't see why we have to do their
 
03:11:38.429 --> 03:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
hard work here for them I think they
 
03:11:40.070 --> 03:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
they need to debate this they need to
 
03:11:41.389 --> 03:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
make up their mind on a bill and they
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
need to be send something back to us if
 
03:11:45.429 --> 03:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
we want to see marijuana you know
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization in the state of
 
03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:11:50.750 --> 03:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm supporting the the commer
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee's position on this I don't
 
03:11:54.429 --> 03:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
think we should be changing the policy
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know let the Senate do what
 
03:11:56.520 --> 03:11:59.269 align:start position:0%
and uh you know let the Senate do what
they

03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
will further questions representative
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
sweee thank you I I think I understand
 
03:12:06.750 --> 03:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
where everyone's coming from and it's a
 
03:12:08.670 --> 03:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
tough part for our committee to be in
 
03:12:10.590 --> 03:12:10.600 align:start position:0%
because we're not supposed to engage in
 
03:12:13.590 --> 03:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
the policy but this model that's in
 
03:12:15.590 --> 03:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
front of us on this amendment is the
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
most likely to become law model that we
 
03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
have and I think our responsibility as
 
03:12:24.750 --> 03:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee is to make sure to
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
protect the state budget to protect the
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that we are fully vetting the
 
03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
most likely to become law option ahead
 
03:12:34.429 --> 03:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
of us so I would urge support of this
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
amendment I do I I understand there will
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
be further amendments on how we break
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
down the finances and where the revenue
 
03:12:42.950 --> 03:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
goes and potentially where penalties lie
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
and all the different parts of the the
 
03:12:46.429 --> 03:12:46.439 align:start position:0%
white board that representative Maguire
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
has listed there but I do believe we
 
03:12:50.750 --> 03:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to the legislature
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
to fully vet the financial
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
implementation of the franchise model so
 
03:13:01.469 --> 03:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
place represent a while or anything to
 
03:13:08.269 --> 03:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
add well my constituents don't expect me
 
03:13:12.990 --> 03:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.790 --> 03:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
legalization representative cell thank
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair well from a I won't look at
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
it from a policy policy standpoint but
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
from a strictly Financial standpoint the
 
03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment before us I believe to be is
 
03:13:30.190 --> 03:13:30.200 align:start position:0%
is costly and I don't believe it's cost
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
competitive and I believe it's a losing
 
03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
proposition from a financial standpoint
 
03:13:36.830 --> 03:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
from what I see here yes so I would be
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
against this
 
03:13:42.670 --> 03:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
amendment further
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
questions represent sweee thank you Mr
 
03:13:46.670 --> 03:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I I will say I think we can
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
expect an updated fiscal analysis from
 
03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission as early as
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
compared to what we've received earlier
 
03:13:56.630 --> 03:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
that showcases that for this budget it's
 
03:13:59.150 --> 03:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
not as costly as it was once presented
 
03:14:00.990 --> 03:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
to be and I think if we were to adopt
 
03:14:02.790 --> 03:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment we'd be able to get into
 
03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:06.710 align:start position:0%
the amendment we'd be able to get into
that

03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:09.229 --> 03:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you Mr chairman so
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
just to address that specifically this
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
amendment does have a higher um uh fee
 
03:14:21.510 --> 03:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
or or uh cut for the for the state
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
compared to the other one one is 10%
 
03:14:24.429 --> 03:14:24.439 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:14:26.790 --> 03:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
125% so in that sense it's more money
 
03:14:33.630 --> 03:14:33.640 align:start position:0%
for the state um and secondly it has um
 
03:14:36.670 --> 03:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
the the issue of what's the cost of the
 
03:14:39.229 --> 03:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
regulation I think is roughly the same
 
03:14:41.550 --> 03:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
in the two bills it's not the same on
 
03:14:44.710 --> 03:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
paper yet but but we're going to get to
 
03:14:47.790 --> 03:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
that issue right here
 
03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
and so it would be the same you know
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to need the same kind of
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
computer system they're going to need
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
roughly the same personnel and and all
 
03:14:59.030 --> 03:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing so um I guess it's
 
03:15:01.190 --> 03:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
possible that the the franchise model
 
03:15:03.990 --> 03:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
has more rules so it might be a little
 
03:15:06.150 --> 03:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
more costly in that sense but I I don't
 
03:15:10.870 --> 03:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:13.630 --> 03:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
amount seeing no further questions I do
 
03:15:15.950 --> 03:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
have a couple of comments first of all I
 
03:15:18.590 --> 03:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
agree with representative cells and
 
03:15:21.389 --> 03:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
representative grassy on statements made
 
03:15:23.590 --> 03:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
by them and also you representative
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
Sweeney that we need to do
 
03:15:28.030 --> 03:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
something uh however I don't believe the
 
03:15:31.150 --> 03:15:31.160 align:start position:0%
Maguire amendment is that something I
 
03:15:33.790 --> 03:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to stick with the house
 
03:15:36.670 --> 03:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
position because if you look at the
 
03:15:38.590 --> 03:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
Maguire Amendment and I believe this is
 
03:15:40.110 --> 03:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much copied from what we were
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
given by senator abbis in my quick not
 
03:15:46.750 --> 03:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
number by number but reading it through
 
03:15:46.760 --> 03:16:47.110 align:start position:0%
number by number but reading it through
yester

03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:50.269 --> 03:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment myself that strictly stays
 
03:16:53.950 --> 03:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
within the um excuse me guidelines of
 
03:16:53.960 --> 03:16:55.189 align:start position:0%
within the um excuse me guidelines of
financial

03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
financial
 
03:16:58.189 --> 03:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
policy uh for the most part and that's
 
03:17:00.349 --> 03:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh deleting some of the issues that give
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
broad authority to The Liquor Commission
 
03:17:04.510 --> 03:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
for transfer of funds that that would
 
03:17:07.550 --> 03:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
require fiscal committee oversight as is
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
done with other departments as we all
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
know in the State uh there's a maybe we
 
03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
ought to pass that out since I've
 
03:17:23.070 --> 03:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:23.080 --> 03:17:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
excuse

03:17:33.030 --> 03:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:41.389 --> 03:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
I so even though this looks like a very
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
extensive Amendment there's only a few
 
03:17:48.150 --> 03:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
things in there and as Mike explained
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
that because certain sections were
 
03:17:54.349 --> 03:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
changed within the proposal the almost a
 
03:17:56.630 --> 03:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
complete Amendment had to be redrafted
 
03:17:59.070 --> 03:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
but there's specific areas that I will
 
03:18:02.710 --> 03:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
Point your attention to uh on page three
 
03:18:02.720 --> 03:18:03.670 align:start position:0%
Point your attention to uh on page three
for

03:18:03.670 --> 03:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:18:07.030 --> 03:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
instance um doing away with the uh
 
03:18:10.910 --> 03:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention treatment
 
03:18:13.590 --> 03:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
recovery uh that was a
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
new commission if you will or fund that
 
03:18:20.030 --> 03:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
we we spoke about that uh over and above
 
03:18:21.750 --> 03:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission of drug and
 
03:18:21.760 --> 03:18:23.189 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission of drug and
alcohol

03:18:23.189 --> 03:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
03:18:25.150 --> 03:18:25.160 align:start position:0%
abuse uh it
 
03:18:27.469 --> 03:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
eliminates all the percentage
 
03:18:29.750 --> 03:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
contributions in the original Bill found
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
on page
 
03:18:35.110 --> 03:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
33 starting with the 65% education trust
 
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
fund the 10% for the community
 
03:18:40.750 --> 03:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
investment fund and so forth going down
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh on page again 33 of the initial
 
03:18:45.840 --> 03:18:47.670 align:start position:0%
uh on page again 33 of the initial
bill

03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:18:49.389 --> 03:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
there was broad language in there giving
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission complete authority
 
03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:53.439 align:start position:0%
to move money without any legislative
 
03:18:56.590 --> 03:18:56.600 align:start position:0%
oversight that's been
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
eliminated on page
 
03:19:03.670 --> 03:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
11 some more important pieces on the I'm
 
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
sorry going to page 10 of the top number
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
line three Roman five would be a
 
03:19:15.389 --> 03:19:15.399 align:start position:0%
requirement that the commission would
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to send a report report to the
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
Commerce Commission Commerce Committee
 
03:19:24.630 --> 03:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
committee on their progress as far as
 
03:19:29.550 --> 03:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
making all this work and that would be
 
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh no later than three months after the
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
effective date of the chapter and
 
03:19:36.389 --> 03:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
continuing and I don't see the time Mike
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:45.550 --> 03:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
quarterly but so I'll mark that I think
 
03:19:48.510 --> 03:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
the quarterly report got left out yeah
 
03:19:51.349 --> 03:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
okay quarterly reporting by
 
03:19:51.359 --> 03:19:53.150 align:start position:0%
okay quarterly reporting by
the

03:19:53.150 --> 03:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:56.429 --> 03:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
commission and then one of the more
 
03:19:58.670 --> 03:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
substantial Financial
 
03:20:01.189 --> 03:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
changes instead of the money coming from
 
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund whatever money that
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
would be whether it's $18 million $8
 
03:20:07.950 --> 03:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
million that would come directly from
 
03:20:12.550 --> 03:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.790 --> 03:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
funds um so the appropriation of
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
$100,000 doll is at the bottom of page
 
03:20:23.030 --> 03:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
11 appropriation uh found at line 24
 
03:20:25.469 --> 03:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
both of those Appropriations would come
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
from the liquor fund and not General
 
03:20:34.309 --> 03:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.189 --> 03:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
Hoffman I think you covered it and the
 
03:20:38.750 --> 03:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly is in there at the beginning
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
of that that section on report okay I
 
03:20:45.710 --> 03:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.670 --> 03:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
guess so again that's my amendment to
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
try to stick with the house
 
03:20:54.750 --> 03:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
position um I did share the amendment I
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative Le has had
 
03:20:59.790 --> 03:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
a chance to review my suggestions but uh
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
it's a prime sponsor I let her know this
 
03:21:05.469 --> 03:21:05.479 align:start position:0%
morning and what I had proposed so
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
think I don't think I added anything I
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:41.110 --> 03:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
five okay the way this is drafted they
 
03:21:44.070 --> 03:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
replaced the whole section so you've got
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of pages without any
 
03:21:48.349 --> 03:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
change and that's one of the things that
 
03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
was just kind of repasted so letters and
 
03:21:54.309 --> 03:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
numbers changed but content didn't
 
03:21:58.229 --> 03:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
I I guess representative cells thank you
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh just to be clear so if and
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
when revenues are generated where would
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
the revenues go once they would come
 
03:22:08.429 --> 03:22:08.439 align:start position:0%
back to the general just thank
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
you as you'll see and I think it's uh
 
03:22:13.870 --> 03:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
remaining funds shall be deposited in
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
the general funds found in page 11 so
 
03:22:16.239 --> 03:22:17.189 align:start position:0%
the general funds found in page 11 so
once

03:22:17.189 --> 03:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
once
 
03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
again everyone that I think we've heard
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
from and all the documentation we've
 
03:22:24.309 --> 03:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
received nobody expects that the state
 
03:22:27.150 --> 03:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
will receive any revenue from either
 
03:22:29.150 --> 03:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
plan for up to two
 
03:22:32.790 --> 03:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
years so there may be a lot of time to
 
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
add and Fiddle with this but anyway
 
03:22:36.910 --> 03:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
these are my suggestions based on what I
 
03:22:41.990 --> 03:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
heard from folks that support the house
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
position anyway representative evil yeah
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:22:50.590 --> 03:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
for the work that you did on your
 
03:22:54.189 --> 03:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I would be supportive of
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
your Amendment and not the Maguire
 
03:22:56.560 --> 03:22:58.269 align:start position:0%
your Amendment and not the Maguire
Amendment

03:22:58.269 --> 03:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:23:01.429 --> 03:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't know that the Senate
 
03:23:04.550 --> 03:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
can't make changes that they that might
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me they do what they want to
 
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
do um on a bill over there I think it's
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
really important that we pass a bill
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that establishes a house position on
 
03:23:16.870 --> 03:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
several things that are of great
 
03:23:19.229 --> 03:23:19.239 align:start position:0%
interest to us many of which that have
 
03:23:21.990 --> 03:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
been discussed here but in particular a
 
03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
good pathway or a better pathway for
 
03:23:29.710 --> 03:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
atcs um and and um other items like that
 
03:23:32.910 --> 03:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
and as much as you know we would like to
 
03:23:35.070 --> 03:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to fully vet the
 
03:23:37.630 --> 03:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
franchise model I just don't think that
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
we have that um option at that point and
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
I guess in going through the policy
 
03:23:46.189 --> 03:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
analysis and commerce you had both these
 
03:23:48.510 --> 03:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
options and you chose the licensing
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
option um that's here um and just again
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
out of respect for the policy work
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's been done in the house and the
 
03:23:58.389 --> 03:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
votes that have been taken on the house
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
floor I think with these few tweaks um
 
03:24:04.150 --> 03:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
we could be respectful of the process
 
03:24:07.389 --> 03:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
and also uh lay down sort of a marker on
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
on our fiscal concerns with the
 
03:24:13.389 --> 03:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
bill representative grassy I I would
 
03:24:14.830 --> 03:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
just say that the work that the Commerce
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
Committee did was basically
 
03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
herculan effort on the part of
 
03:24:21.910 --> 03:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
Representative Leon to make the changes
 
03:24:24.309 --> 03:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
that it were expressed to her were
 
03:24:25.469 --> 03:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
needed to get the governor and the
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senate on board and and I think she
 
03:24:29.990 --> 03:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
pushed it as far as she could to the
 
03:24:31.950 --> 03:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
point where the Cs committee was just
 
03:24:34.510 --> 03:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
going to say no more we like this bill
 
03:24:37.790 --> 03:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
as it is um it was a compromise on a lot
 
03:24:38.910 --> 03:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
of people's Parts there were a lot of
 
03:24:39.910 --> 03:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
things that the minority of the
 
03:24:41.550 --> 03:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
committee felt the Democrats on the
 
03:24:43.830 --> 03:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
committee felt we didn't want to see but
 
03:24:45.630 --> 03:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
we agreed to do this to get a bill over
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
the over the Finish in the house this is
 
03:24:50.349 --> 03:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
The house's position it came through a
 
03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:53.479 align:start position:0%
lot of struggle and a lot of work and if
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
we should send that position the policy
 
03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
position to the Senate and let them work
 
03:25:00.389 --> 03:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
it out and if they disagree with us and
 
03:25:01.590 --> 03:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
they want to send a completely different
 
03:25:04.269 --> 03:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
Bill back to us that's fine but let them
 
03:25:06.070 --> 03:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
make that decision because I think when
 
03:25:07.830 --> 03:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
they see our bill and they get our bill
 
03:25:09.550 --> 03:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
over there and they work through it I
 
03:25:11.150 --> 03:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
think they may see that we came to a
 
03:25:15.429 --> 03:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:15.439 --> 03:25:17.710 align:start position:0%
 
here

03:25:17.710 --> 03:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:25:21.189 --> 03:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I I think I
 
03:25:22.670 --> 03:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
understand the politics that are going
 
03:25:25.830 --> 03:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
on here
 
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
um we all know that this this um
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
amendment makes this Dead on Arrival
 
03:25:37.389 --> 03:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't bother me that much because um
 
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sort of that thrilled with
 
03:25:42.429 --> 03:25:42.439 align:start position:0%
either one of these bills but um but
 
03:25:45.269 --> 03:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen is whatever will
 
03:25:47.910 --> 03:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
pass the house it'll go to the Senate
 
03:25:52.349 --> 03:25:52.359 align:start position:0%
and die and it'll the the story on the
 
03:25:55.389 --> 03:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
headline will be uh Republicans killed
 
03:25:59.710 --> 03:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis right and so uh and since since
 
03:26:03.309 --> 03:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
70% 75% something like that want
 
03:26:05.950 --> 03:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's a political thing and I
 
03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:08.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's a political thing and I
understand

03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
it represent grassing yeah I I I don't
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
think this is the thing that the
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
Republicans Republicans and Democrats
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill hard to get it
 
03:26:19.550 --> 03:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
so Republicans have as much game in this
 
03:26:22.150 --> 03:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill the house position as Democrats do
 
03:26:23.870 --> 03:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
so if the Republicans want to kill a
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
Republican bill
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
fine I hope we can leave politics out of
 
03:26:31.630 --> 03:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
it because
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
I I know I'm I'm like a lot like
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative wer I would be happy to
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
vote itl because I I think there's
 
03:26:40.830 --> 03:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
probably a lot more work to be done here
 
03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
but I do support the work that um the
 
03:26:46.750 --> 03:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
representative from dery did my
 
03:26:50.189 --> 03:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
colleague from Rochester serving over in
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
Commerce and none of us can predict what
 
03:26:55.150 --> 03:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
the house is going to do let alone try
 
03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
to predict what the Senate's going to do
 
03:27:00.189 --> 03:27:00.199 align:start position:0%
so I think the house needs to stand
 
03:27:02.710 --> 03:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
strong and send something over in
 
03:27:04.510 --> 03:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
support of the work of the Commerce
 
03:27:07.349 --> 03:27:07.359 align:start position:0%
Committee and the representative who is
 
03:27:11.189 --> 03:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.910 --> 03:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure I am yeah but uh so and again I I
 
03:27:18.070 --> 03:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
respect the work that you've done
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire I know that this
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
is probably a struggle for you because
 
03:27:24.550 --> 03:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
the draft that came from the senator
 
03:27:26.070 --> 03:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of things that you're
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
completely opposed to and I
 
03:27:30.510 --> 03:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that so you've
 
03:27:32.950 --> 03:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
brought up a number of issues here all
 
03:27:36.030 --> 03:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
of which are on our list to talk about
 
03:27:39.550 --> 03:27:39.560 align:start position:0%
right all of which can be changed in
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
this bill right it this this bill is
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
about a base it's about a starting point
 
03:27:48.349 --> 03:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
all the other things that you brought up
 
03:27:52.189 --> 03:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
are are trivial ancillary issues right
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
that are going to be fixed if and when
 
03:27:57.229 --> 03:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
we start they're not going to be fixed
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
in one in one thing let me make the let
 
03:28:02.590 --> 03:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
me make the
 
03:28:05.870 --> 03:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
case um it's more than just what the
 
03:28:08.110 --> 03:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
governor wants or what the senate senate
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
wants it's a case
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
for why do we want this compared to that
 
03:28:17.389 --> 03:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
right I mean why do we want the
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
franchise model versus that
 
03:28:25.550 --> 03:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
okay what I think is the ultimate um
 
03:28:29.670 --> 03:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
benefit for the for the state is the
 
03:28:33.990 --> 03:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
commission model right I mean we have
 
03:28:37.150 --> 03:28:37.160 align:start position:0%
the most successful liquor business in
 
03:28:40.910 --> 03:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
the country all right it it comes with
 
03:28:43.870 --> 03:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
some cost right it comes with the cost
 
03:28:47.110 --> 03:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
of the liquor available in New Hampshire
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
is less varied than it is in other
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
places we have we have you know big
 
03:28:59.469 --> 03:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
volumes of fewer items but the the all
 
03:29:00.990 --> 03:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
profits from
 
03:29:08.309 --> 03:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
it accw to the state okay um and 50% of
 
03:29:11.269 --> 03:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
those profits are paid by people who
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
don't live in New Hampshire so uh if you
 
03:29:17.750 --> 03:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
look on paper the number of gallons of
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol drunk in New Hampshire is twice
 
03:29:23.469 --> 03:29:23.479 align:start position:0%
the national average and it's not
 
03:29:25.189 --> 03:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
because we're drunks it's because we're
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
making money out of people from M who
 
03:29:33.110 --> 03:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
visit so this is a successful model
 
03:29:36.110 --> 03:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
because those revenues
 
03:29:38.630 --> 03:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
displace other taxes we would
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to have the level of
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
spending we have right so it allows us
 
03:29:48.469 --> 03:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
to have lower business taxes lower
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
property taxes lower um uh all the other
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
taxes right and this tax is the liquor
 
03:30:01.269 --> 03:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
tax is
 
03:30:04.950 --> 03:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
particularly economically uh beneficial
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
right it's a it's a tax on something
 
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's a luxury it's a tax on something
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
that is not a necessity like housing
 
03:30:17.189 --> 03:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
like gainful employment right those
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes and those property taxes
 
03:30:23.870 --> 03:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
are taxes on Necessities not taxes on
 
03:30:27.070 --> 03:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
luxuries all of these liquor taxes are
 
03:30:28.990 --> 03:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
paid 100%
 
03:30:31.550 --> 03:30:31.560 align:start position:0%
voluntarily as as we can see from people
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
out of state I see cannabis as in the
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
same um model cannabis is a luxury it is
 
03:30:40.910 --> 03:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
not a
 
03:30:43.710 --> 03:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
necessity even though some use it as a
 
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
medication and so on but
 
03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's something where at the moment
 
03:30:55.229 --> 03:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
we we we're on the edge of History here
 
03:30:57.550 --> 03:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
in the sense that something that's
 
03:31:00.590 --> 03:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
currently not sold can be sold and we
 
03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
have to talk about how um and if in the
 
03:31:09.070 --> 03:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
long run we could have a cannabis
 
03:31:10.790 --> 03:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission similar to a Liquor
 
03:31:13.150 --> 03:31:13.160 align:start position:0%
Commission we could be in the same
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial boat that we are with liquor
 
03:31:19.590 --> 03:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
right it's not easy it's not guaranteed
 
03:31:22.229 --> 03:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
but it'd be the only way to do it if we
 
03:31:26.150 --> 03:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
go with this um agency model we will
 
03:31:30.630 --> 03:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
have ordinary businesses that sell um
 
03:31:33.670 --> 03:31:33.680 align:start position:0%
sell cannabis uh they'll be regulated
 
03:31:35.870 --> 03:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
they'll be taxed a little bit there
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
won't be any different than things that
 
03:31:41.309 --> 03:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
happen in other states and so we will be
 
03:31:43.750 --> 03:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
missing out on those
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
revenues that displac
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
important revenues and and revenues that
 
03:31:55.070 --> 03:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
are less um economically um beneficial
 
03:31:58.070 --> 03:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um that's the reason to go for the
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
franchise model
 
03:32:05.309 --> 03:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
because a franchise or can always create
 
03:32:05.319 --> 03:32:06.710 align:start position:0%
because a franchise or can always create
company-owned

03:32:06.710 --> 03:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
company-owned
 
03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
stores right we all know that 15 stores
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
is not going to be the final number all
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
right the final number is going to be
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
hundred stores or something in that
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
ballpark and with the franchise model
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
the other 85 stores can be New Hampshire
 
03:32:27.870 --> 03:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
State Stores just like New Hampshire
 
03:32:31.950 --> 03:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
liquor stores and so they can gain all
 
03:32:34.110 --> 03:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
those profits and so on that's the
 
03:32:38.590 --> 03:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
reason for the franchise model so
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know not only is this not going
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
to pass in the long run all right but
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
it's not the right thing in the long run
 
03:32:48.670 --> 03:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
in my opinion thank you Mr
 
03:32:51.150 --> 03:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks sir president MCG I do
 
03:32:55.389 --> 03:32:55.399 align:start position:0%
have one comment though um you said we
 
03:32:57.830 --> 03:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
could take what the Senate has given us
 
03:33:00.590 --> 03:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
or the senator has given us and
 
03:33:05.389 --> 03:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
then adjust this document to fit our
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
needs right so why would we go to all
 
03:33:10.910 --> 03:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
that trouble to adjust the Senate
 
03:33:12.790 --> 03:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment or your
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendment when you just told us that if
 
03:33:18.910 --> 03:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
we send the house version over it's dead
 
03:33:22.110 --> 03:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
at the Senate I'm just because of the
 
03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
model because of the base because of the
 
03:33:29.229 --> 03:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
structure that's the difference the
 
03:33:31.590 --> 03:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
details how much The Liquor Commission
 
03:33:35.070 --> 03:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
is paid where do the funds go what the
 
03:33:37.389 --> 03:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
penalties are for smoking on the street
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
and all those kind of things those are
 
03:33:43.229 --> 03:33:43.239 align:start position:0%
individual details that can be changed
 
03:33:45.510 --> 03:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
all the things you mentioned but what
 
03:33:48.950 --> 03:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't be changed is that one is
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally an um regulating
 
03:33:55.070 --> 03:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
independent businesses it's a it's a
 
03:33:57.950 --> 03:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
regulatory model it's a licensing model
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
right and the other is creating a
 
03:34:04.469 --> 03:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
franchise creating a single business if
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
you will with uh subparts with with
 
03:34:11.550 --> 03:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
franchises all right that's different
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
and so it's it would be hard if not
 
03:34:16.349 --> 03:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
impossible to
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:24.870 --> 03:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
point so just one comment that you
 
03:34:26.670 --> 03:34:26.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned the penalties now on page
 
03:34:30.950 --> 03:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
seven of the draft um it talks about
 
03:34:33.150 --> 03:34:33.160 align:start position:0%
penalties and smoking in public we heard
 
03:34:35.070 --> 03:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
from the good senator from Salem if that
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
was it included a misdemeanor charge at
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
the second offense it was done as far as
 
03:34:41.950 --> 03:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
he was concerned so I'm just concerned
 
03:34:44.429 --> 03:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
that we spent a lot of effort trying to
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
get to a model that you believe we
 
03:34:47.990 --> 03:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
should send to the Senate and we bypass
 
03:34:49.990 --> 03:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
the work of the Commerce Committee and
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
what we've already done I I just can't
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
get my head around that I'm perfectly
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
willing to change that section to be
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
what's in the other bill right I don't
 
03:35:09.309 --> 03:35:09.319 align:start position:0%
think that this is a it may be as I
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand it it's a significant issue
 
03:35:16.910 --> 03:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
for one Senator Senator not for all
 
03:35:20.550 --> 03:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
senators all right so I'm personally
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
opposed to that section as it sits in
 
03:35:26.590 --> 03:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
this amendment all right and I'm willing
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
to to change it to what's in your
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment or what's in the original Bill
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
if there's any differences or what's an
 
03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
existing really I'm I'm I would like to
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
see what's an existing law
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
um so you're right I mean this bill this
 
03:35:46.389 --> 03:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment that I'm proposing needs lots
 
03:35:49.189 --> 03:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
of changes well so what I mean you you
 
03:35:50.870 --> 03:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that makes lots of
 
03:35:53.309 --> 03:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
changes too right
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
so okay four it doesn't really matter
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
right the point is what's the structure
 
03:36:02.469 --> 03:36:02.479 align:start position:0%
what's the base that we can then move
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
forward on and we're going to borrow
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
things from the house bill and add it to
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
this base but the question this is the
 
03:36:13.630 --> 03:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
the main question at the moment is where
 
03:36:17.229 --> 03:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
do you start all right and that's
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
all and just a reminder to the division
 
03:36:22.349 --> 03:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
we have to have everything out of here
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
by Monday of next week so another
 
03:36:27.670 --> 03:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
concern we spent a lot of time on this
 
03:36:30.469 --> 03:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
issue and we have an executive session
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
that the the chair for Tuesday is that
 
03:36:35.710 --> 03:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
right Mr
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative grassie yes Mr
 
03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I think that you know one of
 
03:36:47.349 --> 03:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
Mr representative McGuire had mentioned
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
that it's the franchise system is easy
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
to do but I mean we've had information
 
03:36:53.910 --> 03:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
and testimony before this committee that
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
if we set up a franchise model here
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're now per under the purview of the
 
03:36:58.309 --> 03:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
Federal Trade Commission and the federal
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
franchise regulations so now we bring
 
03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government into this if we
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
go with franchises we now have Federal
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
interference into what we're doing here
 
03:37:06.910 --> 03:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
in the State Licensing is much simpler
 
03:37:09.550 --> 03:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
to do than than franchising because if
 
03:37:11.469 --> 03:37:11.479 align:start position:0%
somebody has a complaint it goes to
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
through Federal process not State
 
03:37:17.229 --> 03:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
process present of
 
03:37:17.239 --> 03:37:19.429 align:start position:0%
process present of
evil

03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
evil
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I was going to do is
 
03:37:27.910 --> 03:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
ask um Mr Hoffman um if he tried to do a
 
03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
side by side of the abbis version versus
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
out I tried to do a three column
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
comparison in as um to keep the font
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
size legible and to get all three on one
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
page it it blew up to 90s something
 
03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
Pages um some of the sections were very
 
03:37:56.110 --> 03:37:56.120 align:start position:0%
close at the beginning and the end of of
 
03:37:58.950 --> 03:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
the bill but when you got into the uh
 
03:38:00.630 --> 03:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
the ru making and some of the little
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
technical things there were a lot of
 
03:38:03.590 --> 03:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
things that were similar but they're in
 
03:38:05.670 --> 03:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
different places so that's a long answer
 
03:38:09.189 --> 03:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
of I failed well but but that's an
 
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
indicator of how many differences there
 
03:38:14.349 --> 03:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
are between the house version and the
 
03:38:18.630 --> 03:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
Senate version number one um and the I
 
03:38:20.590 --> 03:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
guess the other thing I would say is
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
that if we do away with the version of
 
03:38:26.950 --> 03:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
the bill with some tweaks for other
 
03:38:29.910 --> 03:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
things that the house actually
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
passed there's no guarantee the house is
 
03:38:34.590 --> 03:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to accept the amendment that we
 
03:38:37.229 --> 03:38:37.239 align:start position:0%
work on they may give it the heave ho
 
03:38:39.670 --> 03:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
and just go back to the Layon Amendment
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
because they like it better so by really
 
03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
deviating from the house position in a
 
03:38:50.750 --> 03:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
policy way that's also it's a potential
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
risk I don't know how huge it is but
 
03:38:55.070 --> 03:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that um should be
 
03:38:58.150 --> 03:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
considered and considering the time
 
03:39:01.229 --> 03:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
frame that we have to turn this around I
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
just think the hurdle is too big and I
 
03:39:04.750 --> 03:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
should just say I I'm not even sure
 
03:39:06.349 --> 03:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
whether I like the franchise or the
 
03:39:09.150 --> 03:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
licensing model better but I think I
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time to and I'm not
 
03:39:13.870 --> 03:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
sure we have enough time to do all that
 
03:39:16.990 --> 03:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
filtering out in our head and I do not
 
03:39:19.710 --> 03:39:19.720 align:start position:0%
believe that the Senate uh won't feel
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
free to mess around with the bill once
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
it gets over there but at least things
 
03:39:26.950 --> 03:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
we really care about are in the house
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
version so we have a leg to stand on
 
03:39:31.030 --> 03:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
when it goes over
 
03:39:33.670 --> 03:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
there representative Sweeney thank you
 
03:39:35.830 --> 03:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I get it everyone
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
I do want to reiterate representative
 
03:39:40.110 --> 03:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
McGuire's comments and just add the
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
agency model based on the sources that
 
03:39:45.070 --> 03:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
we had in front of us is Dead on Arrival
 
03:39:46.189 --> 03:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
in the C
 
03:39:48.110 --> 03:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
and won't see the light of day and then
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
we scratch off legalization for this
 
03:39:52.670 --> 03:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
year potentially have a governor next
 
03:39:55.189 --> 03:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
year that's not in favor of legalization
 
03:39:57.550 --> 03:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
and so the window for legalization or to
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
build up the model in New Hampshire
 
03:40:02.550 --> 03:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
before it's federally legalized is gone
 
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
and then we'll just be thrown to the
 
03:40:07.950 --> 03:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
Wild Wild West I think we can vote and
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
be purists on what we want and similar
 
03:40:12.670 --> 03:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
to the discussions we had on the budget
 
03:40:15.150 --> 03:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
last year if we all wrote Our Own budget
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
there' be 400 different budgets in the
 
03:40:19.150 --> 03:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
house if there if we all wrote Our Own
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis bill there'd likely be 400 well
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
there'd probably be 130 no legalization
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
and then 270 whatever model works for
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
that individual
 
03:40:33.070 --> 03:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative I think realism and the
 
03:40:34.990 --> 03:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
ability to have influence on the
 
03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
financial model of the franchise model
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
is our best course of action as the
 
03:40:42.510 --> 03:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee because if there were
 
03:40:44.349 --> 03:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
to be a legalization bill that became
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
law it would would be the franchise
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
model and I have no doubt in that and I
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
think anyone that's paying attention if
 
03:40:52.710 --> 03:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
the Senate can takes our bill and amends
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
it to the franchise model if it's not
 
03:40:57.030 --> 03:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
Dead on Arrival and it was a bluff then
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the franchise model
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
that comes to either a concurrence Vote
 
03:41:02.710 --> 03:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
or a committee a conference vote and I
 
03:41:04.429 --> 03:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
have a feeling at that State in June
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
it's probably just going to be
 
03:41:08.429 --> 03:41:08.439 align:start position:0%
concurrence of the house so I think we
 
03:41:11.750 --> 03:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
owe it to the house in June to analyze
 
03:41:13.429 --> 03:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
the financial aspects of the franchise
 
03:41:15.550 --> 03:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
model today let's go through the
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
penalties the funds The Liquor
 
03:41:19.870 --> 03:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
Commission budget atc's transfers
 
03:41:22.269 --> 03:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
reporting licensing appeal schools let's
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
go through all of those functions of the
 
03:41:27.630 --> 03:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
franchise model let's fully analyze the
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
financials of it let's get updated
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes I think we can spend the
 
03:41:33.990 --> 03:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon put together a working
 
03:41:36.750 --> 03:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and strike out parts of of
 
03:41:38.830 --> 03:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
the Maguire Amendment and add things in
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure representative Maguire
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
wants as well uh and make it working so
 
03:41:45.630 --> 03:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
that Tuesday morning we can adopt new
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to this um I think we owe it
 
03:41:50.670 --> 03:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
not only to the the house to on the
 
03:41:52.469 --> 03:41:52.479 align:start position:0%
financial side of things but I think we
 
03:41:55.349 --> 03:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
owe it to ourselves so that's my that's
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
my pitch I think we we should be
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
realists on this and we should be
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
realists as to where this is going and
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
not stick to to what we all may
 
03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:04.750 align:start position:0%
not stick to to what we all may
individually

03:42:04.750 --> 03:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
individually
 
03:42:07.630 --> 03:42:07.640 align:start position:0%
want represent McGuire thank you Mr
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
chairman so um two representative
 
03:42:13.630 --> 03:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
grass's point about the federal um
 
03:42:17.349 --> 03:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
connection I tend to Discount that
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
testimony because I think it's
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
self-serving from people that want um uh
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
they want the agency they want to run
 
03:42:29.429 --> 03:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
agencies and
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
um it just doesn't make sense to me that
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
03:42:37.149 --> 03:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
government could go after individual
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
businesses arbitrarily not just in this
 
03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
state but anywhere they want to versus
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
they decide oh the state you know they'd
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
rather go against the state I mean that
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense to me um you
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
know I don't think our federal
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
delegation would sit for it and things
 
03:42:59.550 --> 03:42:59.560 align:start position:0%
like that um but I do think that
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
representative eel's uh point is very
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
well taken right I mean it's this is
 
03:43:09.710 --> 03:43:09.720 align:start position:0%
quick um it's easier to to go with the
 
03:43:13.030 --> 03:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
house position all that sort of stuff um
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's just a decision we have to make
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
uh um but you know it's her points were
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
good okay we do have the Maguire
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%

124h uh seeing no more discussion would

03:43:38.469 --> 03:43:38.479 align:start position:0%

03:45:56.110 --> 03:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
have ought to pass on um Amendment
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
1339 uh representative
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
Maguire whoops or you want discussion
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
apologize if there's any discussion

representative

03:46:06.510 --> 03:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
Griffin I hate the I I literally hate
 
03:46:13.070 --> 03:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
the agency model and I think it's going
 
03:46:16.630 --> 03:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
to be dead on arrival but I do like the
 
03:46:18.830 --> 03:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
fact that we got all the funds going
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
into the general
 
03:46:25.389 --> 03:46:25.399 align:start position:0%
fund and we are financed and I think if
 
03:46:28.510 --> 03:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
if nothing else this amendment puts
 
03:46:30.750 --> 03:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
whatever Revenue we have in the general
 
03:46:33.469 --> 03:46:33.479 align:start position:0%
fund and I and I will support the
 
03:46:37.189 --> 03:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
amendment for that purpose only thanks
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
sir any further discussion representing
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
Kim BR thank you Mr chair yeah I I'm in

03:46:47.950 --> 03:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
believe that this amendment makes it a
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:56.950 --> 03:46:56.960 align:start position:0%

right what what is her wording about uh

some changes I believe
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
that uh division has U some suggested
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
changes that we will hear it's a
 
04:01:08.960 --> 04:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
changes that we will hear it's a
Amendment

04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
1356 and we've also been given a
 
04:01:14.680 --> 04:01:16.030 align:start position:0%
1356 and we've also been given a
more

04:01:16.030 --> 04:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:01:16.040 --> 04:01:18.670 align:start position:0%
more
detailed

04:01:18.670 --> 04:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
detailed
 
04:01:23.070 --> 04:01:23.080 align:start position:0%
change um as well along with that right
 
04:01:25.630 --> 04:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you Mr chairman um because
 
04:01:27.070 --> 04:01:27.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't know of what the turnaround
 
04:01:29.830 --> 04:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
time would be with um OS I printed out
 
04:01:31.830 --> 04:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
the document that I sent to them with my
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
changes um what I did is I realized that
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of question about what is
 
04:01:40.269 --> 04:01:40.279 align:start position:0%
in the operational choice and what is in
 
04:01:43.710 --> 04:01:43.720 align:start position:0%
the regulatory Choice um so there are
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
many things that are operational
 
04:01:47.469 --> 04:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
decisions that we had put into the
 
04:01:51.149 --> 04:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
regulation of cannabis section uh 318
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
F9 this amendment what it does is it
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
separates out that operational control
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
because truthfully a lot of this
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about franchise or agency um
 
04:02:02.590 --> 04:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
because at this point free Market's off
 
04:02:04.750 --> 04:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
the table but between franchise agency
 
04:02:07.750 --> 04:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
or even state run is operational control
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so by separating those I added the
 
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:11.439 align:start position:0%
definition of operational control model
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that everybody knows what they're
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
talking about with those different
 
04:02:17.710 --> 04:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
um if my interpretation of those isn't
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
right then maybe that may be part of our
 
04:02:21.630 --> 04:02:21.640 align:start position:0%
disagreement about a franchise is where
 
04:02:23.510 --> 04:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the state adopts a franchise or
 
04:02:25.469 --> 04:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
franchisee relationship with private
 
04:02:27.070 --> 04:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
businesses licensed by The Liquor
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
Commission the agency store model which
 
04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
I still believe is the strongest model
 
04:02:33.590 --> 04:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
is where the state requires agreement
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
and compliance from private businesses
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
granted limited licenses by The Liquor
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
Commission beyond the traditional health
 
04:02:42.110 --> 04:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
and safety regulatory role of government
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so to carve that out to make it so
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
that our discussion of franchise versus
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
agency model um if that discussion is um
 
04:02:53.630 --> 04:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
even still alive you would turn to page
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
um move past the first three pages in
 
04:02:58.469 --> 04:02:58.479 align:start position:0%
this separate one it's uh has the
 
04:03:00.269 --> 04:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
operational control of cannabis I have
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
that in as 318 F 9-a so that everything
 
04:03:06.990 --> 04:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
didn't need to get reshuffled in the mix
 
04:03:09.309 --> 04:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
and that separates out um quite a few
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
sections it's probably easier for me to
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
run through those changes off of the
 
04:03:16.389 --> 04:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
leechman one one because we have um or
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
which wherever you'd like me to do it I
 
04:03:19.149 --> 04:03:19.159 align:start position:0%
can tell you which sections were moved
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
out and then um what I think is also
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
most important because there is that
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
risk um let's say that we pass this over
 
04:03:28.910 --> 04:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
to the Senate with the agency model here
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
and they decide to change that section
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
the 9A section to be franchise and then
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
let's say that the federal government
 
04:03:37.710 --> 04:03:37.720 align:start position:0%
puts in a stay and says that we can't do
 
04:03:40.110 --> 04:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
the franchise if we were to concur with
 
04:03:43.309 --> 04:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
them um it adds a sever severability of
 
04:03:45.269 --> 04:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
operational control so if the
 
04:03:49.110 --> 04:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
operational control in RSA 318 f9a is
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
not implemented I put a placeholder date
 
04:03:53.309 --> 04:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
of June 30th
 
04:03:55.870 --> 04:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
2026 operational control provided in
 
04:03:58.110 --> 04:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
that section shall become null and void
 
04:03:59.710 --> 04:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
and all references to operational
 
04:04:01.950 --> 04:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
control requirements shall be waved
 
04:04:03.469 --> 04:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
that's why having the difference between
 
04:04:05.710 --> 04:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
operational control and Regulatory
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
control is important we may choose to
 
04:04:11.269 --> 04:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
change where some of those lines fall uh
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to understand
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
what's operations and what's
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory so looking at that um it
 
04:04:19.269 --> 04:04:19.279 align:start position:0%
basically takes anything where it is
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
beyond normal regulation this is the one
 
04:04:23.710 --> 04:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
about choosing the 15 stores that's a
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
feature of the franchise or agency store
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
model um that capacity isn't really
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
basic regulation that's operational
 
04:04:33.670 --> 04:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
control so that is moved in there the
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
concentration of stores getting new
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
stores becomes operational control um
 
04:04:40.269 --> 04:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
the same as the procedures it would
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
require a franchise um sorry not a
 
04:04:45.990 --> 04:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
franchise an agency store to be approved
 
04:04:47.870 --> 04:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
by the portion of the Liquor Commission
 
04:04:50.510 --> 04:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
that approves agency stores or franchise
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
if they were to change it that way first
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
before they get a license which then
 
04:04:56.309 --> 04:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
would streamline some of the licensing
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
process since they've meet met the
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
requirements for the agency store um I
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
know it's a little bit more complicated
 
04:05:04.309 --> 04:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
but when we had that hearing and we
 
04:05:06.710 --> 04:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
heard about the $5 million computer
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
system if we don't have operational
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
control and Regulatory control separate
 
04:05:13.389 --> 04:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
we're going to be locked into one model
 
04:05:13.399 --> 04:05:14.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to be locked into one model
forever

04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
forever
 
04:05:16.510 --> 04:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
at least if we have these clear lines
 
04:05:18.429 --> 04:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
between the operational control and the
 
04:05:20.269 --> 04:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
regulatory control There's an
 
04:05:22.349 --> 04:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the state to Pivot if
 
04:05:25.550 --> 04:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
we've adopted the wrong model so um just
 
04:05:27.309 --> 04:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's making moving a
 
04:05:29.110 --> 04:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
lot of those
 
04:05:31.750 --> 04:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
into into the operational that's where
 
04:05:33.630 --> 04:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
the restrictions on the logo signage
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
marketing and display of cannabis and
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis products is um it
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
moves it moves all of those over that
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
way and honestly I looked at it and I
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
looked at what if I were
 
04:05:47.469 --> 04:05:47.479 align:start position:0%
to may have been at the bottom of my
 
04:05:50.590 --> 04:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
stack if I were to um write it and write
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
it with a franchise that actually would
 
04:05:54.750 --> 04:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
require changing the words within the
 
04:05:57.070 --> 04:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
agency model and then adding a section
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
where you can set the prices where you
 
04:06:02.149 --> 04:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
can set employee terms and conditions at
 
04:06:04.189 --> 04:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
that point let's lay out specifically
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
what a franchise would do beyond the
 
04:06:08.950 --> 04:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
agency store model and make that clear
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
if the Senate were to change it that way
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
or if there were enough people with the
 
04:06:14.670 --> 04:06:14.680 align:start position:0%
will to bring an amendment um
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
either here or on the floor to change
 
04:06:19.229 --> 04:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
that agency model to a franchise model
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
because other than interfering with uh
 
04:06:23.870 --> 04:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
specific prices and some other business
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
operations the difference between the
 
04:06:29.510 --> 04:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
difference between them um
 
04:06:31.870 --> 04:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
becomes becomes a little bit more clear
 
04:06:33.790 --> 04:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
if we separate out the operational
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
control otherwise the amendment has
 
04:06:37.710 --> 04:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
everything else in the amendment that I
 
04:06:39.710 --> 04:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
brought to you initially it has some
 
04:06:42.429 --> 04:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
improvements in the definitions because
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
I had looked at Senate definitions and
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
it brought some nonsensical ones um that
 
04:06:50.429 --> 04:06:50.439 align:start position:0%
are nowhere nowhere involved any end of
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
this chapter so I removed the
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary ones um and most importantly
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment has the protections for
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment centers so
 
04:07:01.070 --> 04:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
that they can continue to cultivate
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis and they would be able to do
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
both adult use and um and therapeutic
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis at the same location um there's
 
04:07:10.349 --> 04:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
quite a few of those that are very
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
important and even if you don't like my
 
04:07:14.590 --> 04:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
separation of operational control from
 
04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory control um I think it would
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
be necessary to bring back some of those
 
04:07:20.070 --> 04:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
clarifications that I had brought in
 
04:07:20.080 --> 04:07:21.750 align:start position:0%
clarifications that I had brought in
Amendment

04:07:21.750 --> 04:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:07:24.070 --> 04:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
1237 so I know I just jumped a lot on
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
you at the last minute with this but um
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to continue to work to make
 
04:07:33.109 --> 04:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
this correct the um Appropriations that
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
I have in my Amendment are still the
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
previous ones that have what's necessary
 
04:07:38.189 --> 04:07:38.199 align:start position:0%
for the health and human services to
 
04:07:40.109 --> 04:07:40.119 align:start position:0%
collect their data and what not
 
04:07:41.550 --> 04:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
obviously those would need to be changed
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
to coming from liquor funds because it
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
you take send money from one place and
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
you put it to send money for
 
04:07:55.870 --> 04:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.309 --> 04:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
questions good job
 
04:08:03.830 --> 04:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
um is the division prepared to move on
 
04:08:06.510 --> 04:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lan's uh proposal
 
04:08:06.520 --> 04:08:09.750 align:start position:0%
representative Lan's uh proposal
Amendment

04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:12.229 --> 04:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
1356 can I recommend that movement is
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
with um incorporating some of those
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
changes that are inconsistent between
 
04:08:17.109 --> 04:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
yours and mine that you I was going to
 
04:08:18.990 --> 04:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that if this passes I was
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
going to make sure that Mr Hoffman would
 
04:08:23.469 --> 04:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
have done it on his own anyway
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
but okay there's been a motion made by
 
04:08:27.750 --> 04:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Grassi and I apologize
 
04:08:30.269 --> 04:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
who seconded representative
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
Maguire is there any further discussion
 
04:08:36.550 --> 04:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
can I just ask a question sure yeah um
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify for us that are
 
04:08:40.990 --> 04:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
hanging on here by our fingernails how
 
04:08:42.990 --> 04:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
does this duvail with the amendment that
 
04:08:46.189 --> 04:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
we just ad adopted of yours to 1633
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be combined
 
04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
this these are different areas so they
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
will be added to for instance her
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment still has General funds for
 
04:08:57.070 --> 04:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
instance uh funding this U your
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
microphone not on I can actually I I
 
04:09:00.510 --> 04:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
went through and made some notes on here
 
04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
if that' be helpful to know how it
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
dovetails with that good um so the up on
 
04:09:08.550 --> 04:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh the leechman amendment going until
 
04:09:12.469 --> 04:09:12.479 align:start position:0%
page two line 32 nothing has changed
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
until then um that had that section was
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
changed um some I can I will find the
 
04:09:24.510 --> 04:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.630 --> 04:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
there the new section I believe was the
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
annual mandatory training and continuing
 
04:09:33.109 --> 04:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
education um this is one where I did
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
strip out several sections because and
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
sorry and um for sure on page 10 um item
 
04:09:44.070 --> 04:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
five lines 3 through 7 which is is the
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
part part of no later than 3 months
 
04:09:47.510 --> 04:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
after the effective date of this chapter
 
04:09:49.349 --> 04:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
and quarterly thereafter the commission
 
04:09:51.030 --> 04:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
shall report to the house Commerce and
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs committee and the joint
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal um that section would need to be
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
added into mine because that is not in
 
04:10:00.670 --> 04:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
mine um and that is actually one that um
 
04:10:03.790 --> 04:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
we probably would want to look to tie in
 
04:10:07.109 --> 04:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
the um the protective measure that I add
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
into mine on P page 19 line 31 where if
 
04:10:12.990 --> 04:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
the operational control is not
 
04:10:15.550 --> 04:10:15.560 align:start position:0%
implemented on a certain time um perhaps
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
that should be a vote of those
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
committees about whether or not the
 
04:10:21.149 --> 04:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
operational control um seems to be on
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
track but that that section and then in
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations I believe the data
 
04:10:28.309 --> 04:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
collection related to cannabis and
 
04:10:30.030 --> 04:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
legalization which is Page 11 of the
 
04:10:32.710 --> 04:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
leechman amendment from 6 to 14 I can
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
compare and let you know what the
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
differences are there and then um the
 
04:10:39.149 --> 04:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
general funds um but my amendment I
 
04:10:41.550 --> 04:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
don't think touches that section and
 
04:10:45.109 --> 04:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
then the Appropriations because I have
 
04:10:48.070 --> 04:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
Appropriations um including positions
 
04:10:49.870 --> 04:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
that are required for the data
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
collection but I I think that they I
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
think that they mesh very well um it's
 
04:11:01.109 --> 04:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.469 --> 04:11:04.479 align:start position:0%

appropriately thanks so what we can do
 
04:11:58.429 --> 04:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
is if it's all right with everyone we'll
 
04:12:02.790 --> 04:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
vote on the uh bill as amended on Monday
 
04:12:04.429 --> 04:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
everyone has a chance to look at it over
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
the weekend we are not going to meet
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
until 1 o'clock on Monday a couple of
 
04:12:11.750 --> 04:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
our members had some previous
 
04:12:13.950 --> 04:12:13.960 align:start position:0%
engagements but we should be able to
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
move through this pretty quick um
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire so I handed out a
 
04:12:21.950 --> 04:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that deals
 
04:12:24.750 --> 04:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
with I handed out a piece of paper that
 
04:12:28.269 --> 04:12:28.279 align:start position:0%
is the um liquor commission's request
 
04:12:28.279 --> 04:12:29.389 align:start position:0%
is the um liquor commission's request
for

04:12:29.389 --> 04:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:12:32.349 --> 04:12:32.359 align:start position:0%
positions uh or or explanation of how
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
they came up with their fiscal note and
 
04:12:39.550 --> 04:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to assume that these are
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
similar in this in this bill do we know
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
um if if I can comment the fiscal note I
 
04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
believe was based off of mine there were
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
three positions on marketing and
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
advertising that would not be necessary
 
04:12:55.630 --> 04:12:55.640 align:start position:0%
because my Pro my bill prohibits the
 
04:12:58.550 --> 04:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
advertising okay um but I wanted to
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
speak specific to to have us talk at
 
04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
least about um
 
04:13:08.189 --> 04:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement so they want uh
 
04:13:08.199 --> 04:13:09.990 align:start position:0%
enforcement so they want uh
10

04:13:09.990 --> 04:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
um uniformed law enforcement Essen
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
eventually um I don't know if they're
 
04:13:17.109 --> 04:13:17.119 align:start position:0%
all uniform but the 10 law enforcement
 
04:13:19.389 --> 04:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
officer group two law law enforcement
 
04:13:24.030 --> 04:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
officers currently as I understand it um
 
04:13:27.630 --> 04:13:27.640 align:start position:0%
the there's only there's none in the in
 
04:13:30.269 --> 04:13:30.279 align:start position:0%
HHS with the current enforcement of the
 
04:13:35.870 --> 04:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
medical um cannabis program so 10 for 15
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
businesses with with um you know some
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
handful of Growers and so on seems way
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
excessive to me
 
04:13:45.600 --> 04:13:47.309 align:start position:0%
excessive to me
um

04:13:47.309 --> 04:13:47.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:50.229 --> 04:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
yeah and and especially you know hiring
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
of of law enforcement is you know next
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
to Impossible right so we do have the
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Liquor Commission
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
here would you like to address
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
question so yeah so that that one uh
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
just seems Seems way too high
 
04:14:14.159 --> 04:14:15.790 align:start position:0%
just seems Seems way too high
um

04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:18.070 --> 04:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
and what I was told I asked this
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
question of someone of someone else
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
earlier and it said what they told me
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
was they intend to uh aggressively go
 
04:14:31.349 --> 04:14:31.359 align:start position:0%
after um
 
04:14:34.590 --> 04:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
bootlegging right of of cannabis right
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
so because this is now a revenue stream
 
04:14:41.109 --> 04:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
for the state they want to shut down any
 
04:14:43.269 --> 04:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
you know any outside people but it seems
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
to me we've been trying that for a long
 
04:14:49.429 --> 04:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
long long time with with Zero Effect so
 
04:14:49.439 --> 04:14:51.109 align:start position:0%
long long time with with Zero Effect so
you

04:14:51.109 --> 04:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:14:54.389 --> 04:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
know I would think that that we we could
 
04:14:57.109 --> 04:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
greatly reduce that that section of this
 
04:15:02.750 --> 04:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.550 --> 04:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
no all right you've heard U
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's question if you
 
04:15:09.550 --> 04:15:09.560 align:start position:0%
have any information for us on Monday
 
04:15:12.109 --> 04:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank
 
04:15:12.119 --> 04:15:13.630 align:start position:0%
that would be great thank
you

04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
one other question and this might be for
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
representative Lam the
 
04:15:25.109 --> 04:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
um the other Bill had a section on
 
04:15:28.109 --> 04:15:28.119 align:start position:0%
transfer Authority and hiring Authority
 
04:15:31.109 --> 04:15:31.119 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission it suspended
 
04:15:31.119 --> 04:15:32.229 align:start position:0%
by The Liquor Commission it suspended
certain

04:15:32.229 --> 04:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:15:35.109 --> 04:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
rsas and I want to make sure that those
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
are not in these um in what we currently
 
04:15:42.750 --> 04:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
have do you know about that there were
 
04:15:45.870 --> 04:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
number of different um Personnel hiring
 
04:15:48.750 --> 04:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
related things that was that in
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1237 or was that in the bill
 
04:15:55.109 --> 04:15:55.119 align:start position:0%
is passed by the house I'm not sure it's
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's something I saw in actually
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
1214 that I was going to bring up let me
 
04:16:04.990 --> 04:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
see if I can find it here yeah but I
 
04:16:06.910 --> 04:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure it's not a lot of
 
04:16:10.149 --> 04:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
the Senate stuff is copied from the from
 
04:16:11.950 --> 04:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
the house stuff so I just wanted to make
 
04:16:13.950 --> 04:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
sure it's actually I did did uh I did
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
the best I could to compare the two um
 
04:16:19.149 --> 04:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
using find and word and that sort of
 
04:16:21.070 --> 04:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing and most of that seems to come
 
04:16:23.109 --> 04:16:23.119 align:start position:0%
more from the commission report that was
 
04:16:25.269 --> 04:16:25.279 align:start position:0%
never adopted as opposed to from the
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
house house position I did work with
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
them to adopt as much as I possibly
 
04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
could from their model uh but there were
 
04:16:33.550 --> 04:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
some areas where it just didn't
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
integrate well or I fundamentally had
 
04:16:37.469 --> 04:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
the problem with them choosing the
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
setting the
 
04:16:42.630 --> 04:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
prices okay I I'll have to find it I'll
 
04:16:44.469 --> 04:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
do a search myself once we have an
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
electronic ah here it is um it's it's
 
04:16:53.309 --> 04:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
suspending RSA 9 colon 16a N9 colon 17A
 
04:16:55.269 --> 04:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
and N9 colon 17
 
04:16:59.950 --> 04:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
C and is that in 1214 or in which one
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
1214 but but do you have RSA 9 colon 16
 
04:17:07.910 --> 04:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
9 colon 17 in yours anywhere let me let
 
04:17:10.030 --> 04:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
me pull up the bill and that to look for
 
04:17:11.349 --> 04:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
it sorry and which one so that I can
 
04:17:13.630 --> 04:17:13.640 align:start position:0%
look sorry
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
RSA if you could repeat them N9 colon
 
04:17:21.790 --> 04:17:21.800 align:start position:0%
16- a N9 colon 17- a and N9 colon
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
17-c those have to do with you you can't
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
hire people arbitrarily right that you
 
04:17:31.510 --> 04:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
need you need uh author authorization to
 
04:17:33.670 --> 04:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
hire people I can answer that question
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
if You' like yes please uh that section
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
provided for the commission to be able
 
04:17:44.030 --> 04:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
to transfer funds is necessary
 
04:17:47.070 --> 04:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
currently agencies go to the fiscal
 
04:17:50.429 --> 04:17:50.439 align:start position:0%
committee to uh transfer funds Beyond a
 
04:17:50.439 --> 04:17:51.389 align:start position:0%
committee to uh transfer funds Beyond a
certain

04:17:51.389 --> 04:17:51.399 align:start position:0%
certain
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
threshold that was in both bills and
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman's Amendment um
 
04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
removed that so that transfers will have
 
04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
to go to the liquor commit uh the fiscal
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:11.910 --> 04:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
Griffin I'm a little perplexed here
 
04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
because we are the finance
 
04:18:20.389 --> 04:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee and there's a lot of money
 
04:18:20.399 --> 04:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
committee and there's a lot of money
being

04:18:21.510 --> 04:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:18:24.269 --> 04:18:24.279 align:start position:0%
spent with the proposed
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
bill and we raised some questions I
 
04:18:30.670 --> 04:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
think uh representative
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
Maguire raised some questions about
 
04:18:36.030 --> 04:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
where some of that money's
 
04:18:39.149 --> 04:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
going and I think we as a committee we
 
04:18:43.109 --> 04:18:43.119 align:start position:0%
need to spend some time on that so that
 
04:18:46.429 --> 04:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh and I would like to do that before
 
04:18:50.550 --> 04:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
Monday so we know what we're
 
04:18:53.510 --> 04:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
funding that actually we spent a lot of
 
04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
time on policy and models and we haven't
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
spent any
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
time really where the 8 million's going
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
8 million
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
plus and I think we need to address that
 
04:19:10.990 --> 04:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I was a little surprised that the Le
 
04:19:17.550 --> 04:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.550 --> 04:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman hopefully you can have some
 
04:19:22.550 --> 04:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
of that information available to address
 
04:19:24.670 --> 04:19:24.680 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and Griffin's
 
04:19:28.030 --> 04:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
questions as far as some of the expenses
 
04:19:31.389 --> 04:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
for licensing and enforcement and others
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
we did get a draft
 
04:19:36.309 --> 04:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
unapproved for distribution which I
 
04:19:39.389 --> 04:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
guess was from The Liquor Commission
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
Mike the fiscal note on the bill as
 
04:19:45.070 --> 04:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
amended by the house has been updated
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
with that information provided by The
 
04:19:49.950 --> 04:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission typically we will send
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
out a request for a fiscal note when the
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
full body adopts an amendment um and
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's when The Liquor Commission
 
04:20:01.990 --> 04:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
will first get the request to prepare um
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
we can ask sooner and try to put
 
04:20:05.710 --> 04:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
something together because of the time
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
crunch here but uh they everything that
 
04:20:11.630 --> 04:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
they've provided is current as far as
 
04:20:14.590 --> 04:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that have been
 
04:20:17.030 --> 04:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
adopted I think representative Maguire
 
04:20:19.349 --> 04:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
and Griffin ra some interesting points
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
especially when you've got the Cannabis
 
04:20:24.109 --> 04:20:24.119 align:start position:0%
group out there and they don't have a
 
04:20:26.790 --> 04:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
team of investig or law enforcement if
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
you will is that correct Mike no correct
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
inspect thank you represent thank you
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
one of now that we have this language I
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
can go through and find out what needs
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be funded in this budget cycle so
 
04:20:42.990 --> 04:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
that we understand what's necessary for
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
now and what would need to go into place
 
04:20:46.630 --> 04:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
for the next budget cycle given that
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
this is mostly going to be Ru making and
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
setting and establishing the ground
 
04:20:52.510 --> 04:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
rules because we won't have anybody
 
04:20:54.790 --> 04:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
licensed or anybody operating until
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
cycle represent McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
chairman let me ask um is the person to
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
head this
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
position do we know I think think the
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner is going to head the
 
04:21:16.750 --> 04:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
operations commissioner is that correct
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
no well but there'll be a deputy right
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.950 --> 04:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
so right but are those on my question is
 
04:21:30.950 --> 04:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
are those unclassified or one of them
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
unclassified or
 
04:21:36.389 --> 04:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
not they're they're not they're CL
 
04:21:39.830 --> 04:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
classified positions I see
 
04:21:43.870 --> 04:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me to be successful full
 
04:21:48.189 --> 04:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
you need an independent unit
 
04:21:50.870 --> 04:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
04:21:55.349 --> 04:21:55.359 align:start position:0%
runs in uh outside of the normal um
 
04:21:56.830 --> 04:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission stuff because
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise people get get um get pulled
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
different ways right and and and uh you
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
know something urgent happens in liquor
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
and they say well you're not doing
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're not too busy come on over here
 
04:22:13.309 --> 04:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
and help us with this and so on so I I
 
04:22:15.389 --> 04:22:15.399 align:start position:0%
tend to think that the the
 
04:22:18.830 --> 04:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
Cannabis um section needs to be as
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
independent as possible and therefore
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
should have kind of a an independent
 
04:22:29.910 --> 04:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
more independent head so um I tend to
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
think it should be an unclassified
 
04:22:32.399 --> 04:22:35.389 align:start position:0%
think it should be an unclassified
position

04:22:35.389 --> 04:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
anyway now we'll get some information
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
for you from Monday as far as some of
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
those costs okay good representative eil
 
04:22:45.429 --> 04:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
just changing the subject a little bit
 
04:22:48.109 --> 04:22:48.119 align:start position:0%
but uh also getting into money I just
 
04:22:50.349 --> 04:22:50.359 align:start position:0%
want to raise again on page nine of the
 
04:22:52.469 --> 04:22:52.479 align:start position:0%
original bill which is a million years
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
ago um and I don't see Miss chaffy here
 
04:22:59.030 --> 04:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
but this has to do with the misdemeanor
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
issue and how the third time around that
 
04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
you're caught smoking the the um penalty
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
is actually higher than it even is now
 
04:23:12.670 --> 04:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
in existing law and I remember we talked
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
about this to some extent and that it
 
04:23:16.750 --> 04:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
actually is going to put more of an
 
04:23:18.950 --> 04:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
expense and strain on the judicial
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
system than what exists right now um so
 
04:23:27.389 --> 04:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to raise that and see what
 
04:23:36.109 --> 04:23:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:39.309 --> 04:23:39.319 align:start position:0%
that anybody like to comment up
 
04:23:51.269 --> 04:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:54.030 --> 04:23:54.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so we do have a question for you we
 
04:23:56.070 --> 04:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
have not changed the penalty Clause that
 
04:23:58.189 --> 04:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
came out of house Commerce and I guess
 
04:24:00.229 --> 04:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
you spoke of your concern that it was a
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
mror for the Third charge whereas this
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
proposal from the Senate was the second
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
offense was of Mr Mina so so um just to
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
clar thank you representative thank you
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
very much for the opportunity to speak
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
to this I think the primary concern is
 
04:24:20.550 --> 04:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
that the highest penalty is an undefined
 
04:24:24.070 --> 04:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
MISD meter which means that whoever is
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's the the second offense as
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
it was um in uh representative Maguire's
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment or whether or not it's the
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
third offense as it is in the underlying
 
04:24:38.229 --> 04:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
Bill HB um
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
1633 um the concern is that that
 
04:24:42.870 --> 04:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor shouldn't be undefined mind
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple Amendment you would
 
04:24:48.550 --> 04:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
just insert Class B before misdemeanor
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
just I keep saying two little words and
 
04:24:53.229 --> 04:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
with those two little words you would no
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
longer have to find uh fund public
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
defenders for individuals caught smoking
 
04:25:00.269 --> 04:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
in public you would bring the penalties
 
04:25:02.109 --> 04:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
to be much more in line in what the
 
04:25:04.790 --> 04:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
penalties are now currently if you
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
possess um less than 34 of an ounce and
 
04:25:10.510 --> 04:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
are caught smoking in public um and also
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
would avoid the cost of potentially
 
04:25:15.469 --> 04:25:15.479 align:start position:0%
housing um people convicted of this
 
04:25:17.990 --> 04:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
crime for up to a year a year in our
 
04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
County jails um for the penalty and so
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
um again it would be a very simple
 
04:25:27.269 --> 04:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix this issue to a class B
 
04:25:29.070 --> 04:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
it would still be a crime it would still
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
be a fine of up to TW um $1,200 for
 
04:25:35.309 --> 04:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
these individuals so a serious penalty
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
but but not with the cost Associated of
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
putting somebody um in
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
jail represent
 
04:25:44.750 --> 04:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
would that bring it into line with what
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
the current decriminalization penalties
 
04:25:49.309 --> 04:25:49.319 align:start position:0%
are yes sir it would that's I would
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
highly support that considering that was
 
04:25:50.640 --> 04:25:53.870 align:start position:0%
highly support that considering that was
my

04:25:53.870 --> 04:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.550 --> 04:25:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill so I'm getting a general okay
 
04:26:00.590 --> 04:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
from all right Mike if you could change
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
that I guess it's on page nine line 15
 
04:26:04.710 --> 04:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
and I had a little B in front of Mr Meer
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
on line 15 I guess my fault that I
 
04:26:08.429 --> 04:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
didn't include that in one of my
 
04:26:11.469 --> 04:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
suggestions so thank you all right thank
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:21.109 --> 04:26:21.119 align:start position:0%
sir we'll see you on Monday at 1 a.
 
04:26:23.109 --> 04:26:23.119 align:start position:0%

04:26:39.119 --> 04:26:40.750 align:start position:0%
that um yes I believe this has 1,000
ft

04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%

not he wants 2,000 ft I don't know if
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
that well then we won't be able to get
 
04:26:51.870 --> 04:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
one in sale them schools are too closed
 
04:26:57.750 --> 04:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.510 --> 04:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
right the fiscal note
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
um your Amendment changed the source of
 
04:27:05.269 --> 04:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
funds of the
 
04:27:07.710 --> 04:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
appropriation but as written in the bill
 
04:27:09.870 --> 04:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
the appropriation from the
 
04:27:13.429 --> 04:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
fund um does doesn't change the fiscal
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
impact but where the appropriation comes
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
from right and the bill lays out the $8
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
million will cover Administration so the
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
response that the Liquor Commission gave
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
us for the bill as amended by the house
 
04:27:31.030 --> 04:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
which they passed out um last week would
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
still be current except for the change
 
04:27:36.269 --> 04:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
in the source of funds yeah that's how I
 
04:27:39.429 --> 04:27:39.439 align:start position:0%
see it yes yeah so no general fund
 
04:27:42.309 --> 04:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
direct general fund impact no no Direct
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
General funding and and Mr chairman I
 
04:27:45.710 --> 04:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
think representative McGuire did point
 
04:27:47.950 --> 04:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
out that for 15 stores some of their
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
position was asking for seemed excessive
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to have more backup on why
 
04:27:54.750 --> 04:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
they needed those positions and you know
 
04:27:56.750 --> 04:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
they're hiring a Human Service person
 
04:28:00.429 --> 04:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
you Human Services person seems like why
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
but you
 
04:28:05.189 --> 04:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
know well the I believe the commissioner
 
04:28:08.070 --> 04:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the Liquor Commission is here and
 
04:28:11.229 --> 04:28:11.239 align:start position:0%
taken all those questions under
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.980 --> 04:28:24.990 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.990 --> 04:28:27.950 align:start position:0%
