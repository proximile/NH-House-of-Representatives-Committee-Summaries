00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 align:start position:0%

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 align:start position:0%

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
before we begin I just want to indicate
 
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
that we have a aggressive schedule
 
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
hearing schedule for today and for
 
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we have 10 bills scheduled
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
today five in the morning five in the
 
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon and the same for tomorrow
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
we've front-ended the the bills as much
 
00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 align:start position:0%
as possible to hear them and I've tried
 
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 align:start position:0%
to put on the earliest bills the bills
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
that I think can be heard in a in a
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
the and without extensive testimony
 
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.189 align:start position:0%
the and without extensive testimony
the

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
I plan I have already submitted the
 
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 align:start position:0%
bills for next week we'll also have a
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
number of bills for next week there'll
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
be eight on Wednesday and eight on
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
Thursday we have a total of 44 bills
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
that have been assigned to the committee
 
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
that so at the end of next week we will
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
have heard 36 of them
 
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
um the other remaining eight bills are
 
00:06:59.090 --> 00:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
all bills which I think will have long
 
00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 align:start position:0%
hearings and so we I've set them off at
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
the end
 
00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
and we'll plan for that I did say that
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
we would have an executive session on
 
00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
the 26th but uh
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
my vice chair is going to be unavailable
 
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
on the 26th so we may schedule hearings
 
00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
that day as opposed to having the exact
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
session and we may have
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
an exact session that following week
 
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
which would be the first week in
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
February on February
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
2nd and 3rd
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
and what I was thinking of perhaps doing
 
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
was setting aside
 
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
one day for either party to caucus that
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
day we perhaps could have a caucus in
 
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
person that day because we're going to
 
00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:45.710 align:start position:0%
person that day because we're going to
have

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
at that point in time as many as 40
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
bills to look at and then a second day
 
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:53.580 align:start position:0%
where we'll have a full day of executive
 
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
session which I think might work out
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
well for everybody and at that point in
 
00:07:59.710 --> 00:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
time if there needs to be
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittees established we can do that
 
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.770 align:start position:0%
subcommittees established we can do that
and

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
and or work sessions we can plan to do
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
those as well
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%

Concord Ward 6.
um so

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:02.459 align:start position:0%
police officer associations
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
calling and asking for money I'm sure
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
you all have gotten calls like that
 
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.889 align:start position:0%
you all have gotten calls like that
before

00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.899 --> 00:11:14.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
they where police officer associations
 
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
someone will call and
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
tell you about all these things they
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
need money for
 
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.130 align:start position:0%
need money for
um

00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.110 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
solicitation in general is one thing but
 
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.829 align:start position:0%
solicitation in general is one thing but
um

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:36.740 align:start position:0%
the thing that makes police officers
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
associations different is
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
their association with the state people
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
could hear the word
 
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
just that association with state power
 
00:11:56.769 --> 00:11:56.779 align:start position:0%
the power of the state behind it
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
could lead them to think oh no I'm in
 
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
trouble with the police or something
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
I'll be in trouble if I don't donate
 
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.250 align:start position:0%
I'll be in trouble if I don't donate
so

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
and that could lead them to thinking
 
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.550 align:start position:0%
and that could lead them to thinking
that

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
the police are nothing more than just a
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
big extortion wreck it there's something
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
which is not what we want people to be
 
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.590 align:start position:0%
which is not what we want people to be
thinking

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
thinking
so

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah my um
 
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
so my first preference
 
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.110 align:start position:0%
so my first preference
um

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
so would be just to ban the cause
 
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:35.700 align:start position:0%
entirely but that would probably run
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
afoul of freedom of speech
 
00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
um freedom of speech Provisions in the
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution so instead of restricting
 
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:48.620 align:start position:0%
speech I am to solve the problem by
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
adding more speech and
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
having the police officer associations
 
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.550 align:start position:0%
having the police officer associations
be

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
clear about who exactly they are
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're not the police themselves
 
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.269 align:start position:0%
they're not the police themselves
they're

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
a non-profit associated with them and
 
00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
that people are
 
00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
free to refuse to donate and they're not
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
in any trouble legal trouble and
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be afraid or anything so
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will
 
00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:25.579 align:start position:0%
make the experience of
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
receiving these phone calls less
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking for
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
everyone involved so
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
that's why I introduce this bill
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.490 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:45.500 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
hi I'm just curious have you talked with
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
the the people who do these calls and
 
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.329 align:start position:0%
the the people who do these calls and
gotten

00:13:53.329 --> 00:13:53.339 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
not about the bill specifically
 
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
I mean I have when I've received the
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
calls I've asked them
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
to stop calling many times and they
 
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.170 align:start position:0%
to stop calling many times and they
wouldn't

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.730 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
so

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
I felt the need to go
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
ahead with this bill rather than just
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
trying to solve it at the interpersonal
 
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
trying to solve it at the interpersonal
level

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
isn't is isn't compelling speech as much
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
a violation as the first amendment as
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
restricting speech
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
well we do it in we do it in other
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
situations where it's been allowed such
 
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.629 align:start position:0%
situations where it's been allowed such
as

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
the you know this ad
 
00:14:56.329 --> 00:14:56.339 align:start position:0%
I I'm so and so that I approve this
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
message on political advertisements and
 
00:15:03.889 --> 00:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
you know nutrition labels on food
 
00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.689 align:start position:0%
you know nutrition labels on food
and

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
and all other sorts of it's this is put
 
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.329 align:start position:0%
and all other sorts of it's this is put
into

00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
um a section of the rsas about other
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements for phone calls
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
so there's already other disclosure
 
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.670 align:start position:0%
so there's already other disclosure
requirements

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:25.860 align:start position:0%
that other solicitors have to follow and
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is just
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
making it stricter
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
yes oh awesome thank you Mr chair and
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.449 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
question

00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious on how you arrived to
 
00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:50.459 align:start position:0%
specifically just law enforcement
 
00:15:50.459 --> 00:15:51.650 align:start position:0%
specifically just law enforcement
agencies

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
um the reason why I'm asking that is
 
00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:55.019 align:start position:0%
because we have other groups like for
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
instance political parties that might
 
00:15:59.090 --> 00:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
call to call somebody and say you're at
 
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660 align:start position:0%
risk of losing your sustaining
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
membership status and you should you
 
00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
know donate immediately you know it
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
could scare you know a voter into
 
00:16:08.449 --> 00:16:08.459 align:start position:0%
thinking they're losing some sort of
 
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
status so my question is like how you
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
specifically got to just law enforcement
 
00:16:16.129 --> 00:16:16.139 align:start position:0%
well so the difference between
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and a political party is
 
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.470 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and a political party is
that

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.069 align:start position:0%
that
so

00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
the state has a monopoly of violence
 
00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:27.899 align:start position:0%
like that's how it was defined as in the
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate use of force so um
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
the yeah police
 
00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.290 align:start position:0%
the yeah police
um

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
and political parties political parties
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
generally don't
 
00:16:44.569 --> 00:16:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
um armed like
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
police police officers do and it's that
 
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
association with state power
 
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:56.420 align:start position:0%
now if political parties
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
started like employing their own private
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
security forces then yes I would be
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
worried about them too but so far that's
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
not really something we've been seeing
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
we've just been
 
00:17:08.939 --> 00:17:10.970 align:start position:0%
we've just been
seeing

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.750 align:start position:0%
seeing
um

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
so so far it's still the case that the
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
police are the main enforcers of the
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:42.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
okay wouldn't it be easier if um
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
a written disclaimer was required
 
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.970 align:start position:0%
a written disclaimer was required
um

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
in reference to this bill to say
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
something like um
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
this is you are not required to
 
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:57.770 align:start position:0%
this is you are not required to
um

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
donate and whether you donate or not
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
this will have no effect on your
 
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.250 align:start position:0%
this will have no effect on your
personal

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
personal
 
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.870 align:start position:0%
personal
itself

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
so I guess my main question in response
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
to that would be how would a ran
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
disclaimer be provided if it's a phone
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
call we're talking about
 
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.890 align:start position:0%
call we're talking about
um

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
you know that that would have to be
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
that would have to be sent separately in
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
the mail I guess and if people want to
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
cut the conversation off before it even
 
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
gets to the can I mail you a card or
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
something step then they wouldn't get
 
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan do you have a
 
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.110 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan do you have a
question

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
very much representative Gallagher
 
00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:51.539 align:start position:0%
because I think the most recent calls
 
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
are I got on behalf of the police
 
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.529 align:start position:0%
are I got on behalf of the police
um

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it was easy to say no because the
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
caller was actually a robot was um
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
for a pack you know political action
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee and I think it was a federal
 
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
pact too so is your intent
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
to cover those along with the other
 
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
various other entities that
 
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
various other entities that
um

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
purportedly represent the police who uh
 
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
who call us on the phone and try to get
 
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
money out of us
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
um if there's some ambiguity about what
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
counts as a police or law enforcement
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Association I would welcome an amendment
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.850 align:start position:0%
Association I would welcome an amendment
to

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:30.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
clarify the language around what counts
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
as that and what doesn't I think in your
 
00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
particular example that that would count
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
um since it's yeah it does say police
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I I do agree that could be
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
I did have a question and
 
00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:59.450 align:start position:0%
I did have a question and
in the

00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
what would be required for them to say
 
00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:05.220 align:start position:0%
is that they clearly identify themselves
 
00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:08.700 align:start position:0%
and I'm not exactly sure what that means
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
typically when you get a call they say
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
we're calling from the
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
police benevolent Society whatever else
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
what does clearly identify themselves
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
does that mean individually
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
how how would they clearly identify
 
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.110 align:start position:0%
how how would they clearly identify
themselves

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:36.289 align:start position:0%
themselves
um

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:36.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah again
 
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
so yeah again
um

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
this is
um

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
if you think that language is unclear
 
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.710 align:start position:0%
if you think that language is unclear
um

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to reword it a bit
 
00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:52.850 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to reword it a bit
um

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.250 align:start position:0%
um
for

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.169 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:20:57.169 --> 00:20:57.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:59.450 --> 00:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I think
 
00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.130 align:start position:0%
just saying
um

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
who yeah who who they are who they're
 
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
who yeah who who they are who they're
with

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
with
um

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'm actually not too clear
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
on that myself sorry about that
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
what was your intent
 
00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.810 align:start position:0%
what was your intent
um

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.409 align:start position:0%
um
well

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah normally I mean normally people say
 
00:21:27.049 --> 00:21:27.059 align:start position:0%
their own name when they're calling
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
on some um making a phone call hi I'm
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
Eric Gallagher I'm calling about such
 
00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
and such
 
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.649 align:start position:0%
and such
um

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah if they if they could include
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it's not uncommon
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
for people to use pseudo names when
 
00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.090 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:02.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.270 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.529 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:10.070 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really sure how to how to um
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
in the wording though like
 
00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:21.110 align:start position:0%
in the wording though like
if

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
if they're going to use a suit on him
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
like there's not really anything you can
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
do about that is there
 
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.649 align:start position:0%
do about that is there
um

00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
that that would just be in violation of
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
I size with um your bill I get it
 
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:48.659 align:start position:0%
because I got an invitation in the mail
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
from the police department to go to an
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
open house and my husband handed me the
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
letter and said the police are looking
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
for you and you get that what'd I do
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
yeah but as far as phone calls go and
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
rather than having legislation just
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
don't answer the phone screen your calls
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
goes right to voicemail
 
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
goes right to voicemail
well

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
um I mean yeah you can do that with a
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
cell phone but um
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
for those of us with outdated technology
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
like so I live in an apartment complex
 
00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
where there's a buzzer to let people in
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and part of the agreement is that you
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
have to have a landline phone
 
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.409 align:start position:0%
have to have a landline phone
um

00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:27.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
to for the buzzer to be able to work to
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
be able to let people in the main
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
apartment door and
 
00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.570 align:start position:0%
apartment door and
um

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
all I have for it's hard to find
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
landlines these days like I can't
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
um I have to use this old
 
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
um I have to use this old
receiver

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
receiver
 
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.630 align:start position:0%
receiver
from

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.289 align:start position:0%
from
um

00:23:48.289 --> 00:23:48.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
from my pair that's a hand-me-down for
 
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.059 align:start position:0%
my parents that you know it doesn't have
 
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
call screening or anything on it so
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
you have to weigh
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
when you got phone calls from them like
 
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:07.740 align:start position:0%
oh well maybe it is actually something I
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
need to take since I'm expecting a call
 
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.149 align:start position:0%
need to take since I'm expecting a call
from

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
so and so versus oh no is it just
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
another person asking for money so that
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
yeah there are still cases where
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
people can't necessarily screen their
 
00:24:22.919 --> 00:24:26.990 align:start position:0%
people can't necessarily screen their
calls

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.169 align:start position:0%
 
Gallagher

00:24:33.169 --> 00:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:33.830 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
um

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
are you aware that these non-profit
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
agencies that are trying to solicit
 
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.549 align:start position:0%
agencies that are trying to solicit
money

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
have to register with the state prior to
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
being allowed to do that
 
00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:49.669 align:start position:0%
being allowed to do that
um

00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that was mentioned in
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
I think that was mentioned in the RSA
 
00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.750 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
um

00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
I think that's additional information
 
00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful for people to know
 
00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.190 align:start position:0%
that could be helpful for people to know
and

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
these phone calls
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
so that way
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
that way if there's some sort of part of
 
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.510 align:start position:0%
that way if there's some sort of part of
the

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:19.620 align:start position:0%
they they have to make some sort of
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
agreement when registering right about
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do with this
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
registration so
 
00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
um if people know that they have a
 
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:32.460 align:start position:0%
chance to
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
report that they're violating the terms
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
of whatever they signed up for when
 
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
they're registering that would be
 
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
I have another question and at the end
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
of what you've added in as language it
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
says and that the individual has the
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
right to refuse to be contacted at a
 
00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
future time yeah
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the right to refuse is different than
 
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
requiring them not to call you
 
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.409 align:start position:0%
requiring them not to call you
so

00:26:08.409 --> 00:26:08.419 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
is there something in there that would
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being able to call you
 
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.330 align:start position:0%
prevent them from being able to call you
again

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.970 align:start position:0%
again
um

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:23.340 align:start position:0%
at one point in my own version of the
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
text I was drafting I also had a
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
well there's the federal do not call
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
there's the federal do not call list
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
right and um
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
people making calls are supposed to are
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to abide by that so
 
00:26:45.409 --> 00:26:45.419 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to go for something
 
00:26:45.419 --> 00:26:47.149 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to go for something
similar

00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:58.260 align:start position:0%
it being enforced I'd look um
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
I I imagine it would work some like
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
if not
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and fellow
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
representatives of the judicial
 
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.389 align:start position:0%
representatives of the judicial
committee

00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
today I would like to present
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
um house bill
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
1020 in reference to additional
 
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:28.100 align:start position:0%
emergency lighting on
 
00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
police and fire vehicles
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
so my main intention with this bill is
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to Federal standards
 
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to Federal standards
whereby

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
whereby
 
00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.889 align:start position:0%
whereby
um

00:31:42.889 --> 00:31:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
police vehicles can add a red light to
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
the left hand side of the vehicle which
 
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
my intent is the driver's side and fire
 
00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
apparatus can add a single blue light to
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
the right rear side of their apparatus
 
00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
um which is going to be the passenger
 
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:06.470 align:start position:0%
um which is going to be the passenger
side

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
there's a few reasons that I am bringing
 
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:10.700 align:start position:0%
this forward
 
00:32:14.889 --> 00:32:14.899 align:start position:0%
number one is to bring up the federalize
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
standards and also there are other law
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies that travel
 
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
throughout the country
 
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:25.100 align:start position:0%
um like the sheriff's department
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
to do transports of prisoners and some
 
00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:33.299 align:start position:0%
states do not recognize the lighting
 
00:32:37.549 --> 00:32:37.559 align:start position:0%
system of of New Hampshire some States
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
run blue lights for their fire in red
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
red lights for the police so that's why
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing this forward
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and it's um
 
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
for any police and any of the vehicles
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
have to be either owned or leased by the
 
00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.590 align:start position:0%
have to be either owned or leased by the
municipality

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
County or state law enforcement or fire
 
00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:02.149 align:start position:0%
County or state law enforcement or fire
services

00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
in my bill
 
00:33:03.779 --> 00:33:04.430 align:start position:0%
in my bill
um

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
no personally owned
 
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.690 align:start position:0%
no personally owned
um

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is being used as a call
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
member or for fire service will be
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to put a blue light of any type
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
on their vehicle and a
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's fire and on police they are not
 
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to put a red light on their
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
personally owned vehicle this way we can
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
tell police and fire
 
00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:32.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm not familiar with many law
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
enforcements if there's any in the state
 
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that are using the
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles for law enforcement
 
00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.649 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles for law enforcement
um

00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
so my goal is it with this bill is to
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
bring it up to
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
um Federal standards
 
00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
I do have an amendment
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
um which will be Amendment uh
 
00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:57.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
two-018 which I realized in the original
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
um Bill there was a mistake that said it
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
show allow
 
00:34:09.649 --> 00:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
private vehicles to be um
 
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
allowed to put a blue light and this
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
bill this amendment will just change
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
that saying is she'll not permit a
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
privately owned vehicle to put a blue
 
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.329 align:start position:0%
privately owned vehicle to put a blue
light

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:20.339 align:start position:0%
light
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
for a fire service
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much the gist of this
 
00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:34.190 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much the gist of this
bill

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative chartier so is
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
this something that
 
00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
the all the other states have first and
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
also is this going to be so if these
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
were changed would we the public
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
understand what these lights are or is
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
this more just for responders to
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
understand what you're transporting
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question currently
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
this is going to bring it to a
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
standardized requirement in New
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have seen many law
 
00:35:09.349 --> 00:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies and fire agencies
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
putting these lights already on
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
but there's no standardized reasoning
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
when they do it I have seen police
 
00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:20.300 align:start position:0%
vehicles with red and blue
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
across their whole light bar and I have
 
00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.010 align:start position:0%
across their whole light bar and I have
seen

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:24.020 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
fire apparatus with blue
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
um on either side
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping this will standardize that
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
and I really don't think it's going to
 
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.410 align:start position:0%
and I really don't think it's going to
make

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.329 align:start position:0%
make
um

00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
much change I mean because I believe
 
00:35:42.849 --> 00:35:42.859 align:start position:0%
that a lot of the public
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
already sees this in their communities
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
clear representative
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about light bars
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
and lights are we talking about
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
permanently affixed or the ones that
 
00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
people just attach to their groups no
 
00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
these are permanently fixed Lighting
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
systems as you've seen either the light
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
bars on the roof or the ones that are
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
above the visor on the Windows front and
 
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.250 align:start position:0%
above the visor on the Windows front and
back

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome thank you for
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you again
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
I'm still not clear
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
why we need this and again who are these
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
codes for are they for other responders
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
are they for the public to know oh
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
they're transporting a prisoner or oh
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to a fire
 
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.670 align:start position:0%
they're going to a fire
um

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
what's the reason
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
number one is the federal standards and
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
basically I just I have seen again like
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
I said that a lot of agencies are
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
already running
 
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:54.060 align:start position:0%
different light colors
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
um in their light bars or their lighting
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
apparatus and I'm just trying to
 
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380 align:start position:0%
standardize it so I just don't like
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
seeing you know like a cruiser having
 
00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
four red in the front across the whole
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
bar in four blue so I'm trying to
 
00:37:13.310 --> 00:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
standardize it that one side
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
is completely
 
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.030 align:start position:0%
is completely
um

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
no matter which like a left will be for
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
the red for a law enforcement vehicle
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
and the blue on the back of a fire
 
00:37:25.079 --> 00:37:28.250 align:start position:0%
and the blue on the back of a fire
apparatus

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sylvia
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.609 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
do you intend by this to have uh
 
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
modifications made to existing vehicles
 
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
um my bill says
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
it's not a shell it's the agency May so
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
it's going to be the
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
choice of the agency but if they do have
 
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.050 align:start position:0%
choice of the agency but if they do have
um

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.390 align:start position:0%
 
their

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
patent different than what's required
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
they would have to move the lenses or
 
00:38:00.589 --> 00:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
the light
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
you go with the federal standard
 
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.010 align:start position:0%
you go with the federal standard
ly

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
ly
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
I cannot answer that question I'm sorry
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.569 align:start position:0%
 
hello

00:38:26.569 --> 00:38:26.579 align:start position:0%
hello
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe there there was a
 
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:49.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill
 
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.030 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill
um

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
someone goes
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
too much
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
and where it's not a man a mandatory
 
00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
mandate it's going to be up to the
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
community or the agency if they want to
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
right so just follow up the Mandate
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
would come after the effective date so
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
the Mandate would say that if if there
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
were lights that weren't following
 
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:16.980 align:start position:0%
that standard they would have to change
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
it so the the Mandate would come after
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
what what would be the cost if
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
to like change lights around on a
 
00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
other questions representative De
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr Shannon
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
I have representative so does that mean
 
00:39:36.589 --> 00:39:36.599 align:start position:0%
that all new
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
place and fire vehicles after this bill
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
is passed would have to have that
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
standard it does not say that in the
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
bill it says they may choose to do that
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
pattern so if a police department says I
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
want to be strictly blue
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
they can do that
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
or if a fire department says no I want
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
all my lights red they can do that but
 
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
if they decide to do a red light on a
 
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
law enforcement vehicle it does have to
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
be on the left hand side or the driver's
 
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
side of the vehicle and fire wrappers
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
apparatus would have to be on the right
 
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.310 align:start position:0%
apparatus would have to be on the right
rear

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
rear
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
I had a couple questions and and you
 
00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
already mentioned the issue of
 
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
uh what is the left or what is the right
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
um are you going and it depends on which
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
end of the vehicle you're looking at so
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
are you going to do an amendment to
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
this representative Sylvia
 
00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh sorry if this has
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
already been asked um is there a
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
currently in the law is there a
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on doing these various
 
00:40:59.930 --> 00:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
not that I'm aware of
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative another question and that
 
00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
was since the intent as I understand it
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
is to have our state comply with Federal
 
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.630 align:start position:0%
is to have our state comply with Federal
standards

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
would it be easier to Simply refer
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
in our statute that we have to comply
 
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
with Federal standards as as opposed to
 
00:41:31.310 --> 00:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:34.339 align:start position:0%
that might be a little easier Mr chair
 
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
I can explore that and have an amendment
 
00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.150 align:start position:0%
I can explore that and have an amendment
done

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I guess the other question I had was
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
it says privately owned vehicle and
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
you're putting in an amendment in the
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
second part of that but privately owned
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
Vehicles shall not be permitted to a fix
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
red lights in accordance with this
 
00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.310 align:start position:0%
red lights in accordance with this
paragraph

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
it says in accordance with this
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
paragraph but
 
00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
are private vehicles at all allowed to
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
have red lights or
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
or blue lights yes
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I believe in that if you look
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
under that paragraph
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
um that would fall under
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
 
00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.710 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
um

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
police vehicles so any privately owned
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle that is used
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
to do any law enforcement cannot affix a
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
red light
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
because the standard has been for the
 
00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
volunteers or call members that red
 
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.910 align:start position:0%
volunteers or call members that red
lights

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
lights
 
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.170 align:start position:0%
lights
um

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow up so would it be
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
better to clarify that it says privately
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
owned vehicles used for law enforcement
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
shall not be permitted as opposed to
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
just private vehicles that
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use it ordinarily
 
00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:59.329 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to use it ordinarily
anyway

00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:42:59.339 --> 00:43:06.170 align:start position:0%
anyway
yes

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions Mr chair yes thank
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
you representative page thank you
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
um when and forgive me for my ignorance
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
on the federal standards which for these
 
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
I believe it comes under
 
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
I believe it comes under
um

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation I believe that's where
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
it's located but I would have to do a
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
little more research to confirm that
 
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.430 align:start position:0%
little more research to confirm that
okay

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
and is there anything else who would
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
seeing none we will close the hearing on
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
We're not scheduled to for our next
 
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
I have a text from representative
 
00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.609 --> 00:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's all of us or
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
else you just said um I appreciate a few
 
00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
folks would speak louder so I think all
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
I think we can do that we can
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
accommodate representative Smith by
 
00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
just for the committee's benefit I'd let
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know that we do have timelines and
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
the timeline being the
 
00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh the tenth of
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh being the 17th of February to have
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
out any bills that need to go to a
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
second committee and we only have one
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill which we already have scheduled to
 
00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
hear in the next either today or
 
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:34.849 align:start position:0%
hear in the next either today or
tomorrow

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
that needs to go to a second committee
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
and then we need to have all the bills
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
out by
 
01:02:20.829 --> 01:02:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.839 --> 01:02:22.370 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Muse
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
um I'll keep things relatively short
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
this is a relatively uh simple bill that
 
01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
increases the maximum recovery amount
 
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
per claimant in the the state victims
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
compensation fund from 40 to 50 000
 
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.349 align:start position:0%
compensation fund from 40 to 50 000
dollars

01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
it also extends the repeal date of the
 
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:53.780 align:start position:0%
frm recovery
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
contribution Recovery Fund a full year
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
from July of 2023 to July of 2024. one
 
01:03:05.089 --> 01:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
of the other things that it does is it
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
specifies that any money that is left
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
over in the fund at that time would go
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
back into the victims compensation fund
 
01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:15.900 align:start position:0%
so other victims of crime can be
 
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.049 align:start position:0%
so other victims of crime can be
compensated

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
compensated
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
um something that is important to know
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
is that outside of frm money for the
 
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
victims compensation fund uh is not
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
taken from the general fund this is an
 
01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
established fund that's operated by the
 
01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:33.980 align:start position:0%
State Attorney General's office
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
the money that that pays for other
 
01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:39.500 align:start position:0%
victim compensation
 
01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
consists of money from restitution from
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
fines and things of that nature
 
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
and this is a program that has made a
 
01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:54.900 align:start position:0%
big difference in the lives of of
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
victims of crime over the years and I
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
are there questions for representative
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
Muse representative Alexander
 
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.370 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair thank you
representative

01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
um was there some sort of need to extend
 
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:16.140 align:start position:0%
it to the like 10 000 more dollars I
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering like what can what
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
spurred you know the increase here
 
01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
um to be honest I have not had a chance
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
to talk to representative Cushing about
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
the specific rationale for the ten
 
01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:30.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I do know that over the
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
last few years there have been uh
 
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
several attempts made
 
01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
to expand uh the scope of the law so for
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
instance during the session last week
 
01:04:42.609 --> 01:04:42.619 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that we actually passed
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
was a bill that actually would open up
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
the compensation fund to victims of
 
01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
human trafficking it still has to go to
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
the Senate and I believe in 2019 we also
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the issue of the maximum the
 
01:04:58.450 --> 01:04:58.460 align:start position:0%
maximum amount
 
01:05:01.849 --> 01:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
I think the idea behind it is that a lot
 
01:05:04.910 --> 01:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the a lot of the victims of some of
 
01:05:06.829 --> 01:05:06.839 align:start position:0%
these crimes especially the the sexual
 
01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:08.540 align:start position:0%
and the violent crimes
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's an impact on their lives that
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
lasts a long time there's a lot of
 
01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
psychological healing that needs to
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
happen and there are also Economic
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
Consequences of being damaged by crimes
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
like that so it's hard to go out and
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
work every day when you've had something
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
like that happen to you and there are
 
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
some people
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
who can't who have a great deal of
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
difficulty doing it so I think part of
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
the um you know part of what we're
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this fund
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
um is to make sure that there's a part
 
01:05:47.089 --> 01:05:47.099 align:start position:0%
of the Criminal Justice System that's
 
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:49.740 align:start position:0%
there not just for people who are
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
accused of crimes but people who are
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.890 --> 01:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative De Lorenzo
 
01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sherman and thank you Mr
 
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
Muse for taking my question
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
um could you please tell me why the
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
frm Recovery Fund is included in this
 
01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:16.789 align:start position:0%
frm Recovery Fund is included in this
bill

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
again without having spoken to
 
01:06:22.849 --> 01:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
representative Cushing it it I I'm not a
 
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
hundred percent clear on uh on the whys
 
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
and the motivations and things things
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
as as I see it one of the the primary
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
reasons is if there are monies that are
 
01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:39.900 align:start position:0%
left over after the uh the compensation
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
fund has had a chance to run its course
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
those monies would go into the the back
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
into the general victims compensation
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
fund so I think that's one of the things
 
01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:52.700 align:start position:0%
that the bill achieves
 
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:55.740 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:06:57.849 --> 01:06:57.859 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
other than that that's the the rationale
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo you'd like to
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank you
 
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.490 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank you
um

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
I am concerned
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the frm money comes out of the
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
I have concerns about that I know it's
 
01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:25.380 align:start position:0%
been signed into lar but um
 
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to register my concern that
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's appropriate for
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
money from the state budget
 
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
to have funded uh the frm victims
 
01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:39.299 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund because
 
01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
those folks made a funny they made a
 
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk by investing
 
01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
and they were victims of a Ponzi scheme
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
but um I'm just not comfortable with
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.799 --> 01:07:58.210 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:58.220 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and um
 
01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
like my question would probably better
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
be addressed to representative walls or
 
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
Cushing if they're here but um and
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
actually first I had to make a
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
preparatory comment I actually do have a
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
bill that's in Ways and Means which also
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
addresses the frm fund issue the
 
01:08:18.650 --> 01:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
what my bill does is basically just
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh just sunsets as of a 2023 rather than
 
01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
2024 and puts all the funds back in the
 
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:27.660 align:start position:0%
general fund but that's uh that's a
 
01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:28.610 align:start position:0%
general fund but that's uh that's a
matter

01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
matter
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
I can go into that more in the executive
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
session so my question for you
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative Muse is um
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
does this bill have the effect of does
 
01:08:39.530 --> 01:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
that cap that's in the section two so
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
that would apply to the frm victims like
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
any other victim so they would
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
henceforce only be entitled to no more
 
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
than 40 or 50 000 rather and I'm sure
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
most of them rather than whatever amount
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
it damages they're claiming on their
 
01:08:53.759 --> 01:08:55.130 align:start position:0%
it damages they're claiming on their
applications

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
applications
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding the bill also
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
would limit
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
recovery assistance to 50 cents on the
 
01:09:04.749 --> 01:09:04.759 align:start position:0%
dollar for per actual damage
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
so what it would do effectively would it
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
would it would make
 
01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:10.729 align:start position:0%
would it would make
um

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
a higher volume of claimants be eligible
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
for payment without necessarily having a
 
01:09:19.729 --> 01:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
couple of people who suffered extremely
 
01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:21.980 align:start position:0%
large losses kind of running the table
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
before every everyone else had a chance
 
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
to get compensated
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that is also what
 
01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:31.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would achieve okay thanks I
 
01:09:35.570 --> 01:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Chase
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure I understand
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
this so say a victim not not the fmr do
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
they have to submit
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
receipts and who do they go to and who
 
01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.630 align:start position:0%
receipts and who do they go to and who
actually

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:09:59.570 --> 01:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
is watching or overseeing the funding
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
and getting people reimbursed and then
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
how do you know there's more money that
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
was given out and that gets back put
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
back into the fund does that make sense
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
is there a like a lump sum that is for
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
every victim they put their receipts in
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
and then if they don't qual get all that
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
money back then it goes back into the
 
01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:17.630 align:start position:0%
money back then it goes back into the
fund

01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm not I'm not 100 sure exactly
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
how the fund is is uh is administered I
 
01:10:26.050 --> 01:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
believe the Attorney General's office
 
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
administers it um
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay but what process they use to
 
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
determine uh who is eligible and uh the
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
process they use to determine the amount
 
01:10:41.229 --> 01:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
of compensation
 
01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
is probably something you would need to
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
ask them
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying that clearer than I
 
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.770 align:start position:0%
thank you for saying that clearer than I
did

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
and if you would fill out a pink card
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
and some people do that thank you
 
01:11:06.719 --> 01:11:07.850 align:start position:0%
and some people do that thank you
appreciated

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
01:11:09.770 --> 01:11:09.780 align:start position:0%
you indicated that representative walls
 
01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
is on her way do you know what her
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
status is at all
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
I do not
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I had my text messages off so okay
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who here
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
who would like to testify on House Bill
 
01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.370 align:start position:0%
who would like to testify on House Bill
1235

01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
I would note that this is our only bill
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
which is designated to go to a second
 
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:43.970 align:start position:0%
which is designated to go to a second
committee

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:48.900 align:start position:0%
criminal justice no I finance I suspect
 
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:51.470 align:start position:0%
criminal justice no I finance I suspect
uh

01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:53.219 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do at this point in
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
time is recess the hearing and
 
01:11:59.450 --> 01:11:59.460 align:start position:0%
but I will close the hearing at have
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
passed if no one else shows up to
 
01:12:02.219 --> 01:21:36.530 align:start position:0%
passed if no one else shows up to
testify

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to come out of recess on
 
01:21:41.090 --> 01:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1235
 
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:43.340 align:start position:0%
reconvene the hearing
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
and call upon
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh to provide her
 
01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:52.270 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh to provide her
testimony

01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.649 --> 01:21:54.659 align:start position:0%
first of all let me apologize for being
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
late I have agreed to be the permanent
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
sub for Mel Miler on education and we
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
were involved in a hearing and I just
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
lost track of time so I apologize just
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
I've taken on probably more than I
 
01:22:08.820 --> 01:22:10.189 align:start position:0%
I've taken on probably more than I
should

01:22:10.189 --> 01:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
um obviously I was not here for
 
01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative Muse's testimony so I'm
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what he said
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm presuming he introduced the bill
 
01:22:21.050 --> 01:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
we spoke last night so I had some ideas
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
to what he was going to talk about but
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
what I would like to talk about is two
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
things one is is that the need to raise
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
the threshold for the payment to victims
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
of crime from forty thousand to fifty
 
01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:34.910 align:start position:0%
of crime from forty thousand to fifty
thousand

01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
and that stems from the fact that the
 
01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
cost of everything goes up including the
 
01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
cost of the damage to the victims and
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars frankly is still
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
a pretty modest number for a lot of the
 
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
costs associated with people who are
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
victimized by all kinds of crimes and I
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
think we as a legislator need to
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
recognize that their losses increased
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
just as the cost of everything in our
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
lives increases
 
01:23:02.930 --> 01:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
um more
 
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
um obtuse in the bill is the Tie to the
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
frm situation and
 
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
um honestly I had nothing to do to draft
 
01:23:14.990 --> 01:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill but I understand the
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
representing of Cushing's thoughts
 
01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:18.420 align:start position:0%
behind it
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
um he has spoken to me for years talking
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
about the fact that there really was no
 
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
need to do a separate fund for the frm
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
investors that we had this way for
 
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
victims of crime to recover through the
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
fund which is then outside the
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
traditional budget it's funded I Believe
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
by fees and
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
um that they if they really had a loss
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
they should have gone through that
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
particular fund so I believe his attempt
 
01:23:52.729 --> 01:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
to tie the frm fund back to the victims
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
of crime fund is because
 
01:23:58.610 --> 01:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
the frm investors are a victim of crime
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
and that in this state is the
 
01:24:03.470 --> 01:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to recover when you are
 
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
a victim of crime and that that really
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
would have been the more appropriate way
 
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
for them to seek
 
01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:10.750 align:start position:0%
for them to seek
um

01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for their losses
 
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
understanding that their losses would
 
01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
far exceed forty thousand dollars but
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
nevertheless that is the program so my
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
belief is is that his attempt to tie
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
what's ever left in that 10 million
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
dollars that we put in the budget on the
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
frm fund to this is because this really
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate venue for victims of
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
crime to recover their losses
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
those are really the two points I wanted
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
to talk about um uh sadly and not to my
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
liking I seem to know an awful lot about
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
frm I've been involved in it for a long
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
time so to the extent you've got
 
01:24:54.050 --> 01:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
questions about that I have a pretty
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
good idea of what's going on there or
 
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:57.620 align:start position:0%
what has gone on they're more
 
01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
appropriately but I'll take any
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
um regarding the victims of the frm
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
crime Could you
 
01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:16.070 align:start position:0%
crime Could you
um

01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
enlighten me as to the criminal charges
 
01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:21.480 align:start position:0%
and what happened uh was uh was someone
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
found guilty of some particular charge
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh there were there's at least one
 
01:25:28.970 --> 01:25:28.980 align:start position:0%
person sitting in prison to this day
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
honestly representative Sylvia I was
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
focused more on the
 
01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:34.370 align:start position:0%
focused more on the
um

01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:36.050 --> 01:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
their attempts at coming back to the
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
legislature to seek money from the
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
legislature then at the criminal side of
 
01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
it but yes people were charged and
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
convicted and as far as I know are still
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
in prison for that and it was
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
substantial I've I know that there were
 
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
allegations that it was an 80 million
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
dollar loss I mean that is really
 
01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
substantial it's an awful lot of money
 
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
and there were people that personally
 
01:25:59.209 --> 01:25:59.219 align:start position:0%
lost a lot of money I know at least I
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
think one member of this legislature
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
lost two million dollars in that crime
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so yes somebody is paying but I just
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
want to say there are really two
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
parallel things you need to consider
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
here one is the criminal case which is
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
what you asked me about but really the
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
other issue is the civil case and the
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
Civil issues and that's honestly more
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
what I'm familiar with of what happened
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
in the bankruptcy court Superior Court
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
I I had a question because I I read the
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill prior to today and
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
and the part with regard to frm
 
01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:41.930 align:start position:0%
and the part with regard to frm
and

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard earlier from
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Muse was that this now
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
applied the fifty thousand dollar cap to
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
the frm
 
01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.930 align:start position:0%
the frm
legislation

01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
but as I looked at the legislation it
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
appeared to me that the only thing it
 
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
really did this bill did was say that
 
01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:05.699 align:start position:0%
instead of the unused frm funds going to
 
01:27:09.050 --> 01:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
the general fund they now would go to
 
01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.189 align:start position:0%
the general fund they now would go to
the

01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
Victim Assistance fund
 
01:27:14.810 --> 01:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
I believe that is representative
 
01:27:16.490 --> 01:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
Cushing's goal yes
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
that fund tends to run out of money so I
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
think the attempt was to if we've got
 
01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:23.219 align:start position:0%
this pool of money that we are going to
 
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:24.900 align:start position:0%
use for some victims of crime we should
 
01:27:29.209 --> 01:27:29.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
and so I guess the question is do you
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the legislation to
 
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
restrict the frm victims to fifty
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
as the person who didn't draft that it's
 
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
really I know I signed it but as the
 
01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
person who didn't draft that is really
 
01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
hard for me to
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
um say what the intent was
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
um my initial intent was to make sure
 
01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
that the victims of crime could recover
 
01:27:59.750 --> 01:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
more money that was really what what I
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you and and I
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
apologize again for being late this is
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
what happens when I'm serving on two
 
01:28:17.090 --> 01:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
major committees at the same time as you
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
get focused on one thing and forget
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
about another if you haven't already
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card would you do that
 
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
before you leave thank you I just
 
01:28:25.370 --> 01:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
grabbed one thank you thank you thank
 
01:28:28.189 --> 01:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony
 
01:28:30.169 --> 01:28:30.179 align:start position:0%
again is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.169 --> 01:31:29.179 align:start position:0%
we'll call the committee back to order
 
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
and begin our hearing open the hearing
 
01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1435 relative to the right
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
of a victim of domestic violence to have
 
01:31:39.830 --> 01:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
a support person present when testifying
 
01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
or being deposed
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
and we will call upon the prime sponsor
 
01:31:46.729 --> 01:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
representative gay to provide her
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
yes this
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I've
 
01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:05.460 align:start position:0%
I've really haven't
 
01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:08.100 align:start position:0%
a couple years and so I'm not sure of
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
the protocol but I sent you all the
 
01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
amended version and now hopefully you
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
have the paper copy in hand it was
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me by another attorney
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
that it was better to make it General
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
and not not just pointed to protect
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic abuse for one thing
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
they may be in a court hearing to prove
 
01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:38.219 align:start position:0%
that they're victims of domestic abuse
 
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
so this is the level the playing field
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
and let everybody
 
01:32:44.930 --> 01:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
everybody have that right to have
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
someone with them when they testify we
 
01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:48.780 align:start position:0%
know it's usually a pretty
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
nerve-wracking experience for people and
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
usually somebody would however in some
 
01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.930 align:start position:0%
usually somebody would however in some
cases

01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:55.940 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
the presiding judge told the uh the the
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
victim but it could just be any
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
participant that they could not bring
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
somebody in they could only bring in an
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
attorney well if they can't afford an
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
attorney that meant they were there by
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
themselves so this is just to uh
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
restore the right for somebody to have
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
someone with them not to testify just to
 
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:23.540 align:start position:0%
be with them
 
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:27.060 align:start position:0%
you will have a chance to hear a
 
01:33:28.930 --> 01:33:28.940 align:start position:0%
counselor who
 
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
went through this with a
 
01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.250 align:start position:0%
went through this with a
patient

01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
who was such a victim of DV that they
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
had PTSD
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
and could not testify because they were
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
so fearful and so the perpetrator got
 
01:33:49.729 --> 01:33:49.739 align:start position:0%
away free because there was no testimony
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
direct testimony against him
 
01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I guess you can ask me
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
questions if
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative naughter thank you Mr
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
01:34:03.530 --> 01:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
for taking the question does the law
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
currently prohibit a victim of DV from
 
01:34:09.649 --> 01:34:09.659 align:start position:0%
having someone there to support them the
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
law apparently doesn't address it
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
because it was the judge's opinion
 
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
or as ruling that this victim could not
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
have anybody with her unless it was an
 
01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:23.930 align:start position:0%
have anybody with her unless it was an
attorney

01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.090 --> 01:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean it's in statute it's
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:33.659 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:38.149 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:38.159 --> 01:34:39.709 align:start position:0%
um
this

01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
says that the support person shall not
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
be restricted
 
01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
um by the presiding judge and if this is
 
01:34:50.090 --> 01:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
not an attorney
 
01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:53.780 align:start position:0%
that seems like that opens up
 
01:34:57.410 --> 01:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
the court to perhaps some rashed
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
Behavior which the judge would not be
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
able to control
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
could you address that concern yes
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's a different interpretation of
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
what the intention is and so if you want
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
to amend it so that it's more clear
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the intention was that the judge
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
could not set aside the right for the
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
person to have someone with them it
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
didn't mean that the person could do
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
anything they wanted to do
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
so if you want to change those words you
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
know it's fine with me because that's
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.410 --> 01:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay I do have a question then and you
 
01:35:44.830 --> 01:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for people
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
particularly in domestic violence cases
 
01:35:53.390 --> 01:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
to have a support person with them
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
but the support person does not speak
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
and when you testified you said that
 
01:36:04.370 --> 01:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
this person because of PTSD was unable
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
to speak at court is it your intention
 
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
that the support person
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
would actually be representing and
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
speaking on behalf of people
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question again
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
as Dr Wittgenstein from the 1800s
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere said the porosity of language
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
allows a whole lot of interpretation to
 
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
go through the same web of words no this
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
is just a support person to be present
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
again if you want to
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
make an amendment that I'm totally
 
01:36:40.930 --> 01:36:40.940 align:start position:0%
supportive of clarifying the intention
 
01:36:44.209 --> 01:36:44.219 align:start position:0%
it's just half the person there not to
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
testify unless you know unless
 
01:36:50.689 --> 01:36:50.699 align:start position:0%
in an if they're in a trial you know we
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
would hope that they would want to but
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with the
 
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill
 
01:37:02.649 --> 01:37:02.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:37:12.850 --> 01:37:12.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
and I have a card from representative
 
01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:22.729 align:start position:0%
and I have a card from representative
homila

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay and who would you do that it's Dr
 
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
Rhonda Hodge
 
01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
hi hi so my name is Dr Rhonda Hodge and
 
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:44.340 align:start position:0%
I own Harmony Psychiatric Services in
 
01:37:46.850 --> 01:37:46.860 align:start position:0%
Salem New Hampshire board certified in
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
primary care and board certified and
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
Psychiatry I have just under two decades
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
of experience in mental health
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
and some of the work that Betty's been
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing has been pretty incredible and
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
aggressive and necessary so for this
 
01:38:03.110 --> 01:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill in particular one of the reasons
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm here to speak is to give a
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of background but also to
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
tell you one story that's gonna
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
I think in some of the stories that we
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
have it's going to seem as if they
 
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't actually be happening and
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
they're not actually real
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a lot of patients just be by
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
the nature of my work whether it's
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
through patients or friends or friends
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
of friends of friends especially during
 
01:38:27.649 --> 01:38:27.659 align:start position:0%
the pandemic that have come forward with
 
01:38:29.330 --> 01:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
situations like this
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
I went through with this one particular
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
patient based on
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
the abuser's job he is somebody that's
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
not in power as far as
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
this type of power but it still would be
 
01:38:43.729 --> 01:38:43.739 align:start position:0%
considered a power position we went to
 
01:38:46.850 --> 01:38:46.860 align:start position:0%
the attorney general we went to
 
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:47.470 align:start position:0%
the attorney general we went to
um

01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
Rockingham I ended up bringing this
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
particular person to the County
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
prosecutor and they really were super
 
01:38:56.689 --> 01:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
helpful the biggest problem was this
 
01:39:00.169 --> 01:39:00.179 align:start position:0%
young lady had was pregnant and she also
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
had a child
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and she was petrified of this
 
01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
particular person
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
um we also know that he had and this is
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
very common too he had GPS on her phone
 
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
as well as something where he could hear
 
01:39:14.810 --> 01:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
it during our sessions we I would have
 
01:39:17.990 --> 01:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
to put her phone outside of um into a
 
01:39:19.550 --> 01:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
different room so that he would not be
 
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
able to hear her and this is way more
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
common than you think
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
um for example like apple right now has
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
something if you lose your phone or
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
whatever you can stick that right on
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
someone's car and you can track them
 
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so knowing that you can he actually
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
would know where she was right so we
 
01:39:38.330 --> 01:39:38.340 align:start position:0%
were at the prosecutor the excuse me the
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
county attorney
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
a County prosecutor and I had to stay
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
outside while she was being interviewed
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
which makes sense again everybody was
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
supportive everybody was loving
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
everybody was ready to listen but they
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
also have a job to do I was unable to
 
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
stay in there with her
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
we started the interview and I was able
 
01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:57.540 align:start position:0%
to sit next to her just for her to do
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
the basic introduction and before she
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
did her full deposition I was then asked
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
I had to leave because that's what you
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
have to do because if you can't if she
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
couldn't sit in front of a judge if this
 
01:40:10.129 --> 01:40:10.139 align:start position:0%
went to trial
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
then she wasn't nothing like nothing was
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
going to happen right because if they it
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a strong case
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
I waited outside and this was during the
 
01:40:19.199 --> 01:40:20.149 align:start position:0%
I waited outside and this was during the
pandemic

01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't really anyone there so I
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
waited outside and it must have been an
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
hour and a half two hours they tried and
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
she couldn't stop shaking she couldn't
 
01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
stop crying she was scared if he was
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
going to come through the door she was
 
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
scared because she also had to leave her
 
01:40:33.530 --> 01:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
child with somebody else
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
I mean the evidence that we actually had
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
was so strong other than her not being
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
able to speak we had text messages we
 
01:40:44.689 --> 01:40:44.699 align:start position:0%
had pictures we had
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
um medical records not just mine and she
 
01:40:49.490 --> 01:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
had never really come forward to speak
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
and we kind of put it all together to
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
hand it over but she was petrified to do
 
01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:54.229 align:start position:0%
hand it over but she was petrified to do
this

01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
needless to say he did find out what she
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
had done there was no case
 
01:41:03.110 --> 01:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
he's still in a position of somewhat
 
01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.090 align:start position:0%
he's still in a position of somewhat
power

01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:04.100 align:start position:0%
power
 
01:41:07.610 --> 01:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
and she wasn't able to keep herself in
 
01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:09.500 align:start position:0%
her kiddo safe
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
things did happen after and but nothing
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
I mean they are still they they are
 
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
doing somewhat well at this point but
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
without me being there I offered to you
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
know turn around and just hold her hand
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
safe with me which is why she opened up
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
to me to begin with and so me being
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
there for her she probably wouldn't
 
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
would have been able to speak and she
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
begged for it but they couldn't allow it
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
because then they'd have to bring
 
01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
something in front of a judge for trial
 
01:41:43.250 --> 01:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
and if she wasn't able to do that
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
without me being there than there was
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
going to be no case I think that's
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
really has to do with the understanding
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
of what domestic violence does to a
 
01:41:54.890 --> 01:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
victim and you know we know about PTSD
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we know about those isolated
 
01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
incidents with you know for example rape
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
or someone who had a near-death
 
01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:03.790 align:start position:0%
or someone who had a near-death
experience

01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:03.800 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
cptsd is what domestic violence victims
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
have so if you're putting them in front
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
of people who have who are considered in
 
01:42:12.649 --> 01:42:12.659 align:start position:0%
power for them they're feeling really
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
their brain that says like fight or
 
01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:17.870 align:start position:0%
their brain that says like fight or
flight

01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:20.209 --> 01:42:20.219 align:start position:0%
like I'm in danger and it's they can't
 
01:42:21.410 --> 01:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
shut that off
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
so to not have somebody with them you're
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
you're it's never you're never going to
 
01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
get the results in order to keep these
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
people safe and we see it happening I
 
01:42:33.229 --> 01:42:33.239 align:start position:0%
mean we see it happening nationally but
 
01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
we definitely see it happening in this
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
state all the time the stories that I
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
hear and the stories I mean as a
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
provider now in the state of New
 
01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm honestly I when I have
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
people coming to me I don't know whether
 
01:42:49.850 --> 01:42:49.860 align:start position:0%
or not to tell them to go forward or to
 
01:42:52.129 --> 01:42:52.139 align:start position:0%
tell them not to go forward I don't know
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be kept safe and
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
if they don't have somebody with them
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
and they can't even speak how am I as a
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
provider supposed to say no we're going
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
to keep you safe
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
01:43:05.629 --> 01:43:05.639 align:start position:0%
they don't even have a voice while it's
 
01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
still like while their voice is kind of
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
still shaking and they haven't found
 
01:43:09.890 --> 01:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
that strength
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
so I I fully support this
 
01:43:13.139 --> 01:43:13.850 align:start position:0%
so I I fully support this
um

01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:15.770 --> 01:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
people should be able to have somebody
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
with them and somebody that they feel
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
safe with
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
speaking I mean it's easier for it's
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
easy for me to speak to you but imagine
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
that I'm a victim and I'm sitting here
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
in front of this table this is exactly
 
01:43:27.470 --> 01:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
what it looks like
 
01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:30.169 align:start position:0%
what it looks like
so

01:43:30.169 --> 01:43:30.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.689 --> 01:43:32.699 align:start position:0%
questions for Dr Hodge yes
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative nodder thank you Mr
 
01:43:35.810 --> 01:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
question but I have a comment first
 
01:43:40.490 --> 01:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
um I have been the support person for
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
someone who went through a similar
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
situation and I didn't speak I was just
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
there you said some initials and I don't
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
think I wrote them down correctly could
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
you repeat them was it c p s t cptsd so
 
01:43:57.229 --> 01:43:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's complex PTSD and what it means is
 
01:43:59.090 --> 01:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
the difference between PTSD and complex
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
PTSD is complex PS PTSD excuse me is
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
continuously happening so whereas PTSD
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
you're looking at an isolated incident
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
someone who's in an abusive situation if
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
you assume like you're come every time
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
your abuser comes in the door you have
 
01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
to have yourself ready to know you don't
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
know who's walking through the door it's
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
continuous abuse continuous traumatic
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
situations so it's not just not that
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's just because I don't take anything
 
01:44:28.129 --> 01:44:28.139 align:start position:0%
away from PTSD at all and and what it
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
does but the complex PTS it means it's a
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
continuation of things happening
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:38.699 align:start position:0%
it's representative otter um follow-up
 
01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
so PTSD can come at any time like a
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
flashback but complex it never goes away
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
there's constant height and fear is that
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
correct if you're not removed from the
 
01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
situation uh then it's it's pretty
 
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
continuous it's not that it it doesn't
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
it's similar to PTSD and the way that
 
01:45:00.530 --> 01:45:00.540 align:start position:0%
you will have triggers you can go right
 
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
back to that within within seconds with
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
cptsd it's
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
if you are in PTSD and you have a
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
situation where you were somewhere and
 
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:11.100 align:start position:0%
you know the place you know where you're
 
01:45:13.490 --> 01:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
at you know who the person was with CPS
 
01:45:16.129 --> 01:45:16.139 align:start position:0%
PTSD excuse me it can happen throughout
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
the person's entire life so their entire
 
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:20.820 align:start position:0%
life doesn't feel safe so if they're in
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
an abusive situation they don't know
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
when their abuser is going to whether
 
01:45:25.970 --> 01:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's home whether they're at work
 
01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:27.420 align:start position:0%
whether they're getting constant calls
 
01:45:28.970 --> 01:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
whether they're being stalked whether
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're leaving their child I mean it's
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
so continuous it goes throughout their
 
01:45:34.250 --> 01:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
entire life
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
whereas if it's one circumstance it's a
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
little bit easier to work with
 
01:45:41.770 --> 01:45:41.780 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Chase
 
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would you be
 
01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually sitting
 
01:45:52.490 --> 01:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
like this like you're saying as a person
 
01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
is testifying and then what if when they
 
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
go to court would you be sitting
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
actually in the witness stand would you
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to be sworn in as well how does
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
that work I would say and I think that
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
kind of goes back to the comment you
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
were making so that doesn't become an
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
erratic environment I that would be
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
something that I would think would make
 
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
the most sense is that the per the
 
01:46:13.729 --> 01:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
support person be under the same oath as
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
the person they're sitting next to
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
okay thank you one follow-up so then you
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
would actually be sitting with the
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
victim not out where they can see you
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
and have eye contact is this is what
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do you know I would ask
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
Betty for the specifics of that I mean
 
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
it would be it honestly was the best
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation to have especially if I'm
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
thinking of the the people that I've
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
worked with it
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
having somebody out there so if you're
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
sitting sitting it sitting in the box
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
and your support person's right in front
 
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
of you that's great but so is the
 
01:46:46.669 --> 01:46:46.679 align:start position:0%
attorney so is your abusers you know the
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
so to have I if if that support person
 
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't get in the courtroom and
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
typically I'll tell people to kind of
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
make sure they sit back and lean over so
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't necessarily have eye
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
contact with their abuser
 
01:47:02.209 --> 01:47:02.219 align:start position:0%
um but if they don't get that right spot
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom that adds a whole other
 
01:47:05.689 --> 01:47:05.699 align:start position:0%
layer to it
 
01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:07.860 align:start position:0%
I would recommend that somebody is able
 
01:47:11.090 --> 01:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
to sit adjacent to them
 
01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:13.860 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if that fully changes
 
01:47:16.609 --> 01:47:16.619 align:start position:0%
things thank you
 
01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Alexander
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
um we had a similar Bill to this a
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
couple years ago regarding um
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
miners caught in a domestic abuse and
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a therapy animal
 
01:47:34.910 --> 01:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
um with them at the host stand and I
 
01:47:36.530 --> 01:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
think the concern or not the host and
 
01:47:40.310 --> 01:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the where they're testifying
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
um and I think the concern that we had
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
before was about the perceived the
 
01:47:46.729 --> 01:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
perception of the jury to have an animal
 
01:47:49.450 --> 01:47:49.460 align:start position:0%
or another person at the witness stand
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
alongside the victim or perceived
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
alleged victim
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
um in the the perception that the jury
 
01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:58.860 align:start position:0%
would have having somebody like yourself
 
01:48:01.189 --> 01:48:01.199 align:start position:0%
up there with the alleged victim so I
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
guess can you kind of shed some light on
 
01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
that absolutely so the difference would
 
01:48:06.649 --> 01:48:06.659 align:start position:0%
be is that you're either going to get a
 
01:48:08.689 --> 01:48:08.699 align:start position:0%
testimony or you're not is really what's
 
01:48:10.729 --> 01:48:10.739 align:start position:0%
going to happen for most people they
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
will it won't they won't even
 
01:48:13.550 --> 01:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily answer the questions
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
correctly Their Fear in that spidey
 
01:48:17.510 --> 01:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
sense I told you is going to take over
 
01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
so if you have that support person with
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
them and they have again you feel they
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
feel safe with you then
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to be more likely to get
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
an appropriate testimony so a lot of
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
times when somebody is on the stand and
 
01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
they're by themselves not only are they
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
trying to not only are they in fight or
 
01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:41.219 align:start position:0%
flight they are also in a situation
 
01:48:43.609 --> 01:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
where they are um
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
they're scared right so if it doesn't
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
follow through this person in front of
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
them is now it's it's open so the
 
01:48:51.169 --> 01:48:51.179 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to be scared about
 
01:48:52.669 --> 01:48:52.679 align:start position:0%
that so they're going to be calculated
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
in the fact that I'm as far as like I'm
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
I'm too scared they're not able to think
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
clearly they're not able to even answer
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
the questions they're not able to do
 
01:49:04.010 --> 01:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
things in a timeline because they're
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
panicking and a lot of times that's what
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
ends up happening honestly and there's
 
01:49:10.370 --> 01:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
been some research recent studies that
 
01:49:13.550 --> 01:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
um women of course abuse happens to
 
01:49:16.490 --> 01:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
um all both genders but women are 60
 
01:49:18.350 --> 01:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
more likely to lose custody of their
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
children if they say that there's been
 
01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:21.659 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
um so with that there's I think she I
 
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
think Betty used the word hysteria
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's really what is happening you're
 
01:49:31.129 --> 01:49:31.139 align:start position:0%
you're putting people in the situation
 
01:49:31.139 --> 01:49:32.090 align:start position:0%
you're putting people in the situation
where

01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
they can't even think
 
01:49:36.290 --> 01:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
so to ask them to testify and answer
 
01:49:39.770 --> 01:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
01:49:45.239 --> 01:49:49.550 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony

01:49:58.189 --> 01:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you for giving me this
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity I'm representative mola and
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%

here to support this bill and the
amendment

01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.370 align:start position:0%
amendment
um

01:50:13.370 --> 01:50:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I was yesterday I
 
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
was in children and family listening to
 
01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
testimony and in that I saw there was a
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
bill on 50 50 parenting and some parents
 
01:50:24.830 --> 01:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing issues with the
 
01:50:26.689 --> 01:50:26.699 align:start position:0%
family court system came in to testify
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
the level of
 
01:50:32.330 --> 01:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
the level of intimidation they felt in
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
this warm comfortable setting was was
 
01:50:37.010 --> 01:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
Stark and at one point one of the people
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
that were there they were providing
 
01:50:40.609 --> 01:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
testimony they were very upset they've
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
had an awful experience and they could
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
not get through their testimony until
 
01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
somebody came and sat next to them and
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
they just had to be there
 
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:49.370 align:start position:0%
they just had to be there
um

01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
when people are experiencing domestic
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
violence we all know this it's it's just
 
01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
a very intimidating process I less than
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
a year ago I was in a guest in a hotel
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
walking down the hallway the door is
 
01:51:03.649 --> 01:51:03.659 align:start position:0%
open the maid cart was outside and
 
01:51:05.930 --> 01:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
somebody was crying inside I used to be
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
a maid in college so I went right on in
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure she was she or he was okay
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
she was crying and I asked her if she
 
01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:13.980 align:start position:0%
was all right and she was holding her
 
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
phone in her hand and she was telling me
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
my husband just got out of jail
 
01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
we have a restraining order he knows
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
where the kids live
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
and she didn't know what to do in that
 
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
moment she was trying to figure out how
 
01:51:28.850 --> 01:51:28.860 align:start position:0%
is she going to get her kids safe we all
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
know that this doesn't apply just to
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
women when I was stationed in the Air
 
01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
Force I actually worked with a gentleman
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
who was getting abused by his wife
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
here is a very medium-sized guy who
 
01:51:40.609 --> 01:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
could have defended himself in any
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
instance but on one particular instance
 
01:51:44.169 --> 01:51:44.179 align:start position:0%
his male
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
supervisor who is all of five foot and a
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
half inch had a step in the middle of
 
01:51:51.709 --> 01:51:51.719 align:start position:0%
that situation because he could not he
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
could not function he was so intimidated
 
01:51:57.350 --> 01:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
so we already know that those situations
 
01:52:00.350 --> 01:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
are highly charged behind closed doors
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
now you take these individuals and you
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
bring them in a public courtroom and ask
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
them as they must to face the people
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
that they're accusing of abuse
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a very very intimidating process I
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
support this bill because I think this
 
01:52:16.850 --> 01:52:16.860 align:start position:0%
is the a small but very critical step we
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
can do to help people provide effective
 
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.129 --> 01:52:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:30.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase thank you I'm
 
01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
sorry why are you eliminated just to
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
domestic violence what
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
I mean I I understand that I think it's
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
great but there are other things that
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
are traumatic as well would you maybe
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
add on to this if it passes
 
01:52:49.729 --> 01:52:49.739 align:start position:0%
um when I first was considering and was
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
requested to consider the bill you know
 
01:52:53.810 --> 01:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
I was looking at it through the lens of
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
domestic violence but that's a very good
 
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:57.540 align:start position:0%
point and I'm sure that I'm sure the
 
01:52:59.330 --> 01:52:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative gay would be open to any
 
01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:01.820 align:start position:0%
any additional things that can provide
 
01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
provide additional protections to other
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
other people in the same boat thank you
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
I would note that the amendment that
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
representative gay provided us with
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
today indicates it would be for any
 
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you

01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
we are I'm gonna have to take this one
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
off we are the umbrella Organization for
 
01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
the 12 community-based crisis centers in
 
01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that provide free and
 
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:05.820 align:start position:0%
confidential services to victims of
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
Domestic and Sexual Violence all
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire we serve
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
approximately fifteen thousand victims
 
01:54:12.890 --> 01:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
we greatly appreciate the intention of
 
01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor that victims of domestic
 
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
violence have support in court cases and
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
I want to thank the Doctor Who so
 
01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
eloquently talked about how difficult it
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
is for victims to be in court around the
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
domestic violence they've experienced
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
that being said we have two specific
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
concerns about how this bill addresses
 
01:54:36.659 --> 01:54:38.030 align:start position:0%
concerns about how this bill addresses
this

01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:54:40.430 --> 01:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
first of all we do have protocols in New
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have extensive protocols
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
that were created from a
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplinary task force and are
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
housed within the judicial branch that
 
01:54:51.770 --> 01:54:51.780 align:start position:0%
already allow a victim of domestic
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
violence to have an advocate in their
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
court case in their hearings
 
01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
second of all it is unclear to us why
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment would be placed in 173b
 
01:55:05.689 --> 01:55:05.699 align:start position:0%
under the domestic violence protection
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
order statute when the bill itself
 
01:55:10.250 --> 01:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
references family law cases
 
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:11.820 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to take just a minute to
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
share with you what the protocols that I
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
referenced do cover and talk about
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
these Protocols are comprehensive and
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
they reference Advocates over 30 times
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
they outline not only where and how an
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
advocate should be available but how an
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
advocate can focus on the safety of a
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
victim during a court process so I'll
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
just share with you three specific
 
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
sections that reference the role of
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
advocates in these cases in the protocol
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
section 5-14 it provides that when a
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
hearing is conducted quote any Advocate
 
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
assisting the plaintiff shall be allowed
 
01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
to accompany the plaintiff in the
 
01:55:50.209 --> 01:55:50.219 align:start position:0%
courtroom or in Chambers
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
in protocol section 5-25 the the
 
01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:55.500 align:start position:0%
protocol provides that the court should
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
quote make available the phone number of
 
01:55:59.209 --> 01:55:59.219 align:start position:0%
the local crisis center and the
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a court Advocate
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
present during the final hearing and
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
quote furthermore courts should advise
 
01:56:07.970 --> 01:56:07.980 align:start position:0%
and refer plaintiffs to local crisis
 
01:56:09.770 --> 01:56:09.780 align:start position:0%
centers if an advocate is not already
 
01:56:12.169 --> 01:56:12.179 align:start position:0%
present for safety planning which is so
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
important in addition to providing
 
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
support in the actual Court proceeding
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
one third example I'll share is protocol
 
01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
section 7-7 which provides that if a
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
plaintiff is accompanied by an advocate
 
01:56:26.750 --> 01:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
The Advocate should be allowed at
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
Council table
 
01:56:30.290 --> 01:56:30.300 align:start position:0%
and may be allowed limited participation
 
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
in the proceeding at the request of the
 
01:56:34.669 --> 01:56:34.679 align:start position:0%
plaintiff to so so to several of the
 
01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.659 align:start position:0%
questions you asked this morning there
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
are already very specific guidelines for
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
The Advocates who are permitted to be
 
01:56:43.609 --> 01:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
present and be in the courtroom
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
I think what's important about these
 
01:56:47.209 --> 01:56:47.219 align:start position:0%
examples is they illustrate the clear
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
intention of the Courts for domestic
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
violence victims to have an advocate
 
01:56:54.590 --> 01:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
present before during and after their
 
01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:55.609 align:start position:0%
present before during and after their
hearings

01:56:55.609 --> 01:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:56:57.890 --> 01:56:57.900 align:start position:0%
and specifically there are two benefits
 
01:57:00.109 --> 01:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
to having trained Advocates working with
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
victims one is the underlying training
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
Advocates are trained on not just the
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of Domestic and Sexual Violence
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
which you heard about this morning but
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
also about the court process itself
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
the second reason is that we have a
 
01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
statute in New Hampshire that protects
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of communications
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
between victims and those Advocates a
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
concern I would have about the example
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
that was shared with you this morning is
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
that someone like a physician or an
 
01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
untrained support person could then be
 
01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
called as a witness in the case that
 
01:57:33.530 --> 01:57:33.540 align:start position:0%
would be so detrimental to the victim
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
whereas Advocates who are trained at
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
crisis centers are protected
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
in their confidential relationship with
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:47.089 --> 01:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
these domestic violence protocols were
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
intentionally created with an emphasis
 
01:57:51.950 --> 01:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
and a focus on safety planning so the
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
training The Advocates have is not just
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
about the support in the courtroom but
 
01:57:58.010 --> 01:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
also to work with the victim after a
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
hearing to ensure that they're safe
 
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
because what we know is when a victim is
 
01:58:04.490 --> 01:58:04.500 align:start position:0%
finally able to go to court that is one
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
of the most lethal and dangerous times
 
01:58:08.570 --> 01:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
so to have someone with you who has the
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
expertise to help you plan for your
 
01:58:13.609 --> 01:58:13.619 align:start position:0%
safety after the hearing is critical
 
01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:15.540 align:start position:0%
lastly as I mentioned from a drafting
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
perspective we have concerns about where
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
this is being put into the code the bill
 
01:58:22.490 --> 01:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
itself references family law cases but
 
01:58:23.750 --> 01:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's actually an amendment to the
 
01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:25.860 align:start position:0%
protective order statute which is
 
01:58:27.530 --> 01:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
already very clear about the role of
 
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
Advocates and and the support that they
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
can provide to victims so we strongly
 
01:58:35.089 --> 01:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to vote itl on
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
this bill again we are hugely supportive
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
of the opportunity for victims to have a
 
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
support person but we think that that
 
01:58:42.410 --> 01:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
should be done through trained Advocates
 
01:58:43.490 --> 01:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
throughout the state of New Hampshire
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I'm happy to take any
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions questions yes represent Kenny
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
01:58:53.450 --> 01:58:53.460 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
um so you just laid out the protocols
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire already has for a
 
01:58:58.010 --> 01:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
support person
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
can currently a judge disregard those
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
protocols and say no the judge should
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
not disregard them and so I'm not
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with this single underlying
 
01:59:09.530 --> 01:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
case that representative gay was
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
speaking about but we work
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the courts on a
 
01:59:14.810 --> 01:59:14.820 align:start position:0%
regular basis to ensure that judges
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
receive training and are using those
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
protocols and the judicial branch has
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely endorsed them and made very
 
01:59:22.010 --> 01:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
clear through a supreme court order that
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
they should be followed thank you so
 
01:59:23.760 --> 01:59:25.129 align:start position:0%
they should be followed thank you so
much

01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Nader
 
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
so I have two questions the the first
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
one is when does a victim get to meet
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
the trained Advocate and the second one
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
is that how long does it take for a
 
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
victim to learn to grow trust
 
01:59:43.129 --> 01:59:43.139 align:start position:0%
the stranger who's the trained advocate
 
01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
so a victim can reach out for an
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
advocate anytime they want to or need to
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
in fact anyone in New Hampshire who
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
needs support or information or guidance
 
01:59:53.450 --> 01:59:53.460 align:start position:0%
around sexual or domestic violence can
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
call our 24-hour hotline every day of
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
the year so a victim may have just been
 
01:59:59.810 --> 01:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
sexually assaulted may have just been
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
battered maybe thinking about going to
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
the hospital maybe considering reporting
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
to police they can connect with an
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
advocate 24 hours a day it does they
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait until a court process
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
begins Advocates are available in every
 
02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
community in New Hampshire around the
 
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
clock so often what happens is a victim
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
has worked with an advocate quite a
 
02:00:19.370 --> 02:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
while before they are actually in the
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
yep representative wolper thank you Mr
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh my question is for you
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
and for all those who have testified and
 
02:00:36.770 --> 02:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
that it would be do you have written
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that you're submitting to this
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee we do and we sent it to you
 
02:00:41.570 --> 02:00:41.580 align:start position:0%
this morning around 10 15. thank you for
 
02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
asking representative yeah I just it's a
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
lot easier for us if we know that exists
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
and I'm supposed to record that so and I
 
02:00:49.550 --> 02:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
was probably supposed to say that so
 
02:00:53.209 --> 02:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
I had a a couple of things and and the
 
02:00:56.520 --> 02:00:57.370 align:start position:0%
I had a a couple of things and and the
way

02:00:57.370 --> 02:00:57.380 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:00:59.870 --> 02:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is currently written it says that
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
any party could have a support person
 
02:01:02.699 --> 02:01:04.010 align:start position:0%
any party could have a support person
so

02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
that would indicate that not just
 
02:01:09.050 --> 02:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
petitioners and domestic violence could
 
02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
have a petition a support person but
 
02:01:12.719 --> 02:01:14.030 align:start position:0%
have a petition a support person but
a

02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
abuser could have a support person there
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
is that currently the circumstance as
 
02:01:24.770 --> 02:01:24.780 align:start position:0%
far as you know it
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
I don't think the protocol addresses
 
02:01:28.129 --> 02:01:28.139 align:start position:0%
that issue specifically I mean
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
defendants usually frequently are
 
02:01:32.689 --> 02:01:32.699 align:start position:0%
represented by Council and again we have
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
some confusion here about whether we're
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
talking about family law cases or
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
protective order cases
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think that's addressed in
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
the protocol and I think the intent of
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
the protocols is really to ensure that
 
02:01:45.530 --> 02:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
if parties are not whether or not
 
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
they're represented by Council that they
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to that they and I
 
02:01:57.530 --> 02:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
think you'd just address that the issue
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
is having someone who is trained the
 
02:02:03.470 --> 02:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
doctors here the doctor obviously has
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
some training and some background but
 
02:02:07.609 --> 02:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
the way this is written anybody
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
it appears that anybody could be a
 
02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
support person not necessarily someone
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
who is trained you could you could
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
potentially have your beer buddy be your
 
02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
support person if that's what you wanted
 
02:02:22.129 --> 02:02:22.139 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that's true and
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
um what all of the testimony today has
 
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
highlighted is a courtroom is a foreign
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
place for a victim they have already
 
02:02:31.609 --> 02:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
experienced so much trauma and it is
 
02:02:33.169 --> 02:02:33.179 align:start position:0%
most helpful to victims to have someone
 
02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
supporting them through the process who
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
works in the court system routinely who
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
knows how the process works who knows
 
02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
how the clerk's office Works who can
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
explain to victims what to expect when a
 
02:02:44.810 --> 02:02:44.820 align:start position:0%
judge takes a ruling under advisement
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
for example in a protective order case
 
02:02:48.589 --> 02:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
so that training is really critical to
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
the service and support that the victim
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
would receive
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
if I could one last question because
 
02:02:56.209 --> 02:02:56.219 align:start position:0%
this this intrigues me and that's the
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
issue about being present during a
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
deposition and to what extent currently
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
are your advocates
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
depositions my understanding is that
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
it's less frequent for victims to have
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
any support person present with them in
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
depositions because one of the risks
 
02:03:17.930 --> 02:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
that you run is they just become so
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
involved in the case and could become
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
Witnesses so I don't think that's
 
02:03:23.209 --> 02:03:23.219 align:start position:0%
happening very much in general but I'm
 
02:03:25.070 --> 02:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up with you if it if I
 
02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
learn that that's different happy to
 
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
consult with our colleagues at New
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance
 
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:35.410 --> 02:03:35.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:38.030 --> 02:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative di Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
02:03:40.490 --> 02:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
chairman I just have a question of um
 
02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:41.689 align:start position:0%
chairman I just have a question of um
Charlotte

02:03:41.689 --> 02:03:41.699 align:start position:0%
Charlotte
 
02:03:41.699 --> 02:03:42.290 align:start position:0%
Charlotte
um

02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this bill you wreck you
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
recommended itl I'm sorry you
 
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
recommended itl
 
02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
I thank you for your question
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
representative I don't think so because
 
02:03:59.330 --> 02:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think the Avenue for supporting
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
victims is to open the door so widely to
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
people who do not have necessarily the
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
training or background both in trauma
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
and in the court system thank you thank
 
02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:10.070 align:start position:0%
and in the court system thank you thank
you

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
representative otter thank you Mr
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't know if I can how to
 
02:04:16.010 --> 02:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
word this correctly but
 
02:04:19.129 --> 02:04:19.139 align:start position:0%
if someone's a victim of domestic
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
violence I don't know I don't know if
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
that I believe that they actually need
 
02:04:25.609 --> 02:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
somebody trained a stranger I think just
 
02:04:28.129 --> 02:04:28.139 align:start position:0%
having someone they trust with them is
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
is what will give them the confidence to
 
02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:32.689 align:start position:0%
is what will give them the confidence to
speak

02:04:32.689 --> 02:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:35.089 --> 02:04:35.099 align:start position:0%
so I you know I think what I would say
 
02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
to that is I I hope that an advocate
 
02:04:38.209 --> 02:04:38.219 align:start position:0%
would not be a stranger to the victim
 
02:04:39.649 --> 02:04:39.659 align:start position:0%
first of all it's not someone who just
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
shows up on the day of the hearing this
 
02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:43.260 align:start position:0%
is the person they have met with to get
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
oriented to the court process perhaps to
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
review the forms together to prepare for
 
02:04:48.890 --> 02:04:48.900 align:start position:0%
the court hearing so it's not someone
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
new just showing up at the hearing
 
02:04:53.330 --> 02:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
um and certainly having an advocate
 
02:04:55.790 --> 02:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't take away from the fact that we
 
02:04:57.169 --> 02:04:57.179 align:start position:0%
encourage all victims to have an
 
02:04:58.669 --> 02:04:58.679 align:start position:0%
extensive support system and people
 
02:05:00.350 --> 02:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
could still come and sit in the gallery
 
02:05:02.510 --> 02:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
during a hearing but the protocol
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
specifically provide for an advocate as
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
you heard who could be at Council table
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and I think for that person we do want
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
someone as you all pointed out in your
 
02:05:11.810 --> 02:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
questions earlier who's familiar with
 
02:05:13.129 --> 02:05:13.139 align:start position:0%
the court process who would understand
 
02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
what the judge's expectations are around
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
courtroom decorum and responses so for
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
that particular role I do I respectfully
 
02:05:22.370 --> 02:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
disagree and think the training is
 
02:05:22.380 --> 02:05:25.310 align:start position:0%
disagree and think the training is
important

02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony thank
 
02:05:29.050 --> 02:05:29.060 align:start position:0%
you so much
 
02:05:32.570 --> 02:05:32.580 align:start position:0%
and the last witness submitting a card
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.800 --> 02:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
aches

02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.609 --> 02:05:52.619 align:start position:0%
I'm up okay
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
um good morning my name is Richard head
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the government and Affairs
 
02:05:57.470 --> 02:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
coordinator for the judicial branch I do
 
02:05:59.870 --> 02:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
not have written testimony I'm here to
 
02:06:01.609 --> 02:06:01.619 align:start position:0%
provide information
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
um on the bill we do not have a specific
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
position on the bill as you heard from
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
the past the last speaker there are
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protocols I won't
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
repeat that but those are utilized by
 
02:06:17.089 --> 02:06:17.099 align:start position:0%
the judges and that's the process
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're following in the
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases I do want to
 
02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
point out there is
 
02:06:26.750 --> 02:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
um uh currently a domestic violence task
 
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
force that is under that is underway the
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice set it up the end of last
 
02:06:34.250 --> 02:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
year they had their first meeting
 
02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
yesterday and those meetings are going
 
02:06:36.420 --> 02:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
yesterday and those meetings are going
on

02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:06:41.530 --> 02:06:41.540 align:start position:0%
it is a an important
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
vehicle for any suggestions relative to
 
02:06:47.089 --> 02:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with domestic
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
violence because at those task force
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
meetings are a wide range of of people
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
with different backgrounds different
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
expertise and can bring to a particular
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
issue a breadth of knowledge and
 
02:07:05.450 --> 02:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
experience that is is very important
 
02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
when trying to vet these types of very
 
02:07:11.330 --> 02:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
important issues so anyone who has a
 
02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:12.649 align:start position:0%
important issues so anyone who has a
specific

02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts or or suggestions relative to
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
domestic violence protocols domestic
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
violence process or or anything in this
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
Arena I would urge you to and anybody to
 
02:07:26.689 --> 02:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh to reach out to a member of that
 
02:07:26.699 --> 02:07:28.189 align:start position:0%
uh to reach out to a member of that
commission

02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
um and talk to them about any specific
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
issues that that you may have on the
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
Court's website is a link to the to the
 
02:07:39.410 --> 02:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
task forces website their meetings are
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
being streamed their meetings are being
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
recorded and available on the on the
 
02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
task Force's website so it is an
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
important mechanism and I expect that
 
02:07:50.570 --> 02:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
coming out of that task force will be
 
02:07:52.430 --> 02:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
legislative recommendations I would be
 
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:55.320 align:start position:0%
surprised if they are not so that is an
 
02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
important vehicle I think for ideas such
 
02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
as this to be vetted to be vetted in a
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a public forum but also with
 
02:08:06.770 --> 02:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
people who have a diverse back who have
 
02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
diverse backgrounds and can bring that
 
02:08:11.570 --> 02:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
that type of information and knowledge
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
to these types of issue use so I think
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
it's also so for for information that's
 
02:08:19.370 --> 02:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
a it's an important process that is
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
going on now and the expectation is
 
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:24.020 align:start position:0%
they're going to be issuing a report
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
probably in March or April of this year
 
02:08:31.790 --> 02:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
um I also note that the amendment I
 
02:08:32.930 --> 02:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
think there are questions about it
 
02:08:35.750 --> 02:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
earlier uh talks about
 
02:08:39.310 --> 02:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
um the the person who would be present
 
02:08:42.169 --> 02:08:42.179 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to any restrictions
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
by the trial judge and that is
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
concerning that does create potential
 
02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:50.099 align:start position:0%
problems both in terms of due process in
 
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:51.860 align:start position:0%
terms of the management of the courtroom
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
and how and and to ensure that the
 
02:08:56.750 --> 02:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
rights of all of the parties are
 
02:08:59.510 --> 02:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
respected and followed so I think that
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
type of of openness is significantly
 
02:09:05.270 --> 02:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
problematic in terms of a trial judge's
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
Authority and and obligation to maintain
 
02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:10.619 align:start position:0%
order in a courtroom
 
02:09:13.729 --> 02:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
um with also regard to the the amendment
 
02:09:17.390 --> 02:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
um it is it is undefined in terms of who
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
the support person would be as you heard
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
in earlier testimony there is a system
 
02:09:25.850 --> 02:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
where uh where domestic violence
 
02:09:27.890 --> 02:09:27.900 align:start position:0%
Advocates do have the right to be
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
present with the victim at Council table
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
and throughout the proceeding if
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
somebody arrives at the courthouse
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
without any domestic violence advocate
 
02:09:40.729 --> 02:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
in their in their background or
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
presently using utilizing one clerks do
 
02:09:47.209 --> 02:09:47.219 align:start position:0%
inform uh the people as they're coming
 
02:09:49.609 --> 02:09:49.619 align:start position:0%
up to the window to file about the
 
02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
services what's available it's a very
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
important part of that that transaction
 
02:09:57.290 --> 02:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
if if the domestic violence victim is
 
02:09:58.970 --> 02:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
interacting with the clerk's office so
 
02:10:01.129 --> 02:10:01.139 align:start position:0%
that knowledge and information is
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
provided at the court but they're
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
typically as you heard before they're
 
02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
coming to the court already with an
 
02:10:09.410 --> 02:10:09.420 align:start position:0%
advocate with them and those Advocates
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
are trained and the court process is
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly important and that training
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
is incredibly important because
 
02:10:17.810 --> 02:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
misinformation can be equally damaging
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of ensuring that the process is
 
02:10:23.330 --> 02:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
followed and ensuring that the that the
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
parties to these proceedings are getting
 
02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
accurate information about the
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
proceeding to ensure that their rights
 
02:10:32.030 --> 02:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
are also being that their rights are are
 
02:10:35.810 --> 02:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
being properly represented without a I'm
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
sorry one one last thought in terms of
 
02:10:43.129 --> 02:10:43.139 align:start position:0%
access to to support people in a
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
courtroom there is sort of a separate
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
body of law that deals with Americans
 
02:10:51.830 --> 02:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
with Disabilities if there is a person
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
who is unable to obtain access to court
 
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
proceedings because of a disability that
 
02:10:58.850 --> 02:10:58.860 align:start position:0%
includes mental health issues it
 
02:11:00.890 --> 02:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
includes physical disabilities includes
 
02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
a whole host of potential issues those
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
are and we do see those addressed
 
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
through motions to the court depending
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
on the type of accommodation that is
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
being requested but accommodations
 
02:11:16.129 --> 02:11:16.139 align:start position:0%
outside of of the state statute but
 
02:11:18.169 --> 02:11:18.179 align:start position:0%
within the context of the Americans with
 
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
Disabilities do apply and there can be
 
02:11:23.689 --> 02:11:23.699 align:start position:0%
very specific instances where an
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
accommodation is granted because of a
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
disability that is that is raised to the
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
judge raised in a timely way in which
 
02:11:33.890 --> 02:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
the the judge is then able to to proceed
 
02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
with that but that also comes with sort
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
of a burden to make sure that the the
 
02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
issues are presented to the court the
 
02:11:43.609 --> 02:11:43.619 align:start position:0%
information is is is accurate and the
 
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
accommodation is is requested
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
and with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:11:50.270 --> 02:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman are
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.770 --> 02:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
uh for a person who has a disability at
 
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
what point in the case
 
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
would the
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
victim file for reasonable accommodation
 
02:12:16.669 --> 02:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
would that be with an answer or
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
something like that so the thank you for
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
the question the the issue of when the
 
02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation is provided is
 
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
is really there are actually two ways it
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
can be raised one is whether or not it
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
has a direct impact on the case whether
 
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
you know it be the setup of the
 
02:12:37.609 --> 02:12:37.619 align:start position:0%
courtroom sometimes is important the the
 
02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
density of people that's in the
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
courtroom can be important the uh the
 
02:12:44.930 --> 02:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
presence of of a support person may be
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
at issue in in terms of the
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
accommodation but it has to be raised so
 
02:12:55.729 --> 02:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
if it is uh if it relates to sort of the
 
02:12:58.129 --> 02:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
Court proceeding it would have to be
 
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
raised before the hearing occurs because
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
the court then needs to you know
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
evaluate the accommodation requested
 
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
ensure that it's available and to ensure
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
that it does not otherwise impact the
 
02:13:14.209 --> 02:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
proceeding in a negative way so not all
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
accommodations are going to be granted
 
02:13:18.410 --> 02:13:18.420 align:start position:0%
if the accommodation requested is going
 
02:13:20.450 --> 02:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
to adversely impact the case
 
02:13:23.629 --> 02:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
if it's not sort of a procedure case
 
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
specific issue those are handled more at
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
the administrative office of the courts
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
so those are examples of needing
 
02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
interpreters needing
 
02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:36.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who can do sign language
 
02:13:40.669 --> 02:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who has difficulty with uh with
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
reading there may be other
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
accommodations that are not specific to
 
02:13:46.970 --> 02:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
a case but in order to provide that
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
person with access typically language is
 
02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
the most common those are requested
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
before the proceeding to ensure that an
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
interpreter with the right skills is

come before you in support
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and I I take with great interest the
 
02:14:38.750 --> 02:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
the commentaries
 
02:14:41.330 --> 02:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
um and the testimonies that have
 
02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
proceeded relative to The Advocates
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
protocols and that's really good news
 
02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:50.030 align:start position:0%
protocols and that's really good news
um

02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
and uh to know that the court has
 
02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations and Advocate
 
02:14:56.760 --> 02:14:58.069 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations and Advocate
protocols

02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
protocols
 
02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
is comforting however
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's a personal aspect
 
02:15:07.010 --> 02:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
of people who have been abused
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
are in a syndrome
 
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult for them to speak
 
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
in public
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
and in court forum
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
and and other places where they have to
 
02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
address what's been done to them
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm focusing on the personal aspect
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
of this Advocates are fine if they're
 
02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:29.750 align:start position:0%
of this Advocates are fine if they're
available

02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
and I've heard that they're not always
 
02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:32.709 align:start position:0%
and I've heard that they're not always
available

02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:15:36.470 --> 02:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and The Advocate is well trained as they
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
is not a known person
 
02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
now there is the possibility when The
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
Advocate and the
 
02:15:47.149 --> 02:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
um plaintiff meat that they click and
 
02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
there's a immediate confidence but we
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
know human nature varies so it could be
 
02:15:54.770 --> 02:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
the opposite
 
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
the value
 
02:15:59.629 --> 02:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
of a known person entity
 
02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
as a support person and if not at the
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
council table
 
02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the room where eye contact
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
could be made and The Advocate
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
can call upon that person to come to
 
02:16:15.290 --> 02:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
Plaintiff in order to be able to elicit
 
02:16:16.850 --> 02:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
02:16:19.510 --> 02:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
seems like it shouldn't be an either or
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
but how about a combination of both
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
and maybe under reasonable accommodation
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
an advocate assigned could also enlist
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
the support of that support person in in
 
02:16:37.250 --> 02:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
the in case there is a difficult moment
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
and the testimony stops because of the
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff's discomfort and stress
 
02:16:48.889 --> 02:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
so I would say that this law doesn't
 
02:16:51.889 --> 02:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
challenge anything that's already there
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
but actually edifies what the court has
 
02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:55.790 align:start position:0%
but actually edifies what the court has
made

02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
and the protocols are in effect
 
02:17:02.270 --> 02:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage the committee to
 
02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
support and move this bill forward thank
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
02:17:08.810 --> 02:17:08.820 align:start position:0%

02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:11.580 align:start position:0%

um I believe you said that under our
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
current procedures that sometimes
 
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
Advocates are unavailable so are there
 
02:17:25.310 --> 02:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
um plaintiffs have requested Advocates
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then have not been able to be given
 
02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.690 align:start position:0%
and then have not been able to be given
one

02:17:32.690 --> 02:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%

personal knowledge of these situations I
 
02:17:40.969 --> 02:17:40.979 align:start position:0%

thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
02:20:19.849 --> 02:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:20:22.010 --> 02:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Dan McGuire and I'm from
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
Epsom I was a State Rep when we started
 
02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:27.590 align:start position:0%
Epsom I was a State Rep when we started
um

02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:31.310 --> 02:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
uh improving the asset forfeiture area
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
of state law maybe eight years ago
 
02:20:37.010 --> 02:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
something like that and
 
02:20:39.590 --> 02:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
um so this bill we we've been doing it
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
over the years in in Little Steps and
 
02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:45.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is yet another uh little step
 
02:20:48.290 --> 02:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are there are three
 
02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:50.030 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are there are three
bills

02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:20:52.429 --> 02:20:52.439 align:start position:0%
um relating to asset forfeiture that are
 
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
being heard at this very moment this one
 
02:20:56.929 --> 02:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
and two next door in criminal justice
 
02:20:58.250 --> 02:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
that's why you're going to see people
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
shuttling back and forth I'm sorry to
 
02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:01.090 align:start position:0%
shuttling back and forth I'm sorry to
say

02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:01.100 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
but what this bill does is
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
um so asset forfeiture is the the
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
process of when there are there's
 
02:21:14.450 --> 02:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
property used in the commission of a
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
crime or that is the result of a crime
 
02:21:20.150 --> 02:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
um typically we're talking about drug
 
02:21:23.170 --> 02:21:23.180 align:start position:0%
crimes so it could be
 
02:21:26.450 --> 02:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
a vehicle used as part of selling drugs
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
it could be property used it could be
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
cash that's a result of selling drugs
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so that property can
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
be seized by police officers and and
 
02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
um forfeited and under state law we have
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
what's called criminal forfeiture which
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
means that we now have we didn't
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
originally but we now have criminal
 
02:21:53.389 --> 02:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
forfeiture which means that the
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
perpetrator of the crime has to be
 
02:21:59.210 --> 02:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
convicted of that crime and then the
 
02:22:01.969 --> 02:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
property in involved can be forfeited
 
02:22:01.979 --> 02:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
property in involved can be forfeited
under

02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:22:07.910 --> 02:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
previous state law and under federal law
 
02:22:10.670 --> 02:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's a it's it's almost it's they have
 
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
what's called civil forfeiture which
 
02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
means that there's effectively a
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
separate case against the car or the
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
cash or whatever compared to the person
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
and they could even not charge a person
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
of a crime but they could still go
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
forward with a case against the property
 
02:22:32.330 --> 02:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
and say that the property was involved
 
02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:35.220 align:start position:0%
in the commission of a crime and the
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
reason we've we've changed state law to
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
criminal forfeiture is is twofold one is
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the burden of proof on criminal
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
cases is is higher you you have to prove
 
02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
things Beyond a reasonable doubt you
 
02:22:56.929 --> 02:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
have to provide if in the case that the
 
02:22:59.389 --> 02:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
the defendant is Indigent you have to
 
02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:01.740 align:start position:0%
provide an attorney that sort of thing
 
02:23:05.450 --> 02:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
whereas the case in civil court is just
 
02:23:07.670 --> 02:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence there is
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
no attorney provided and so on and so
 
02:23:11.809 --> 02:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
it's been the feeling of the New
 
02:23:15.650 --> 02:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature that
 
02:23:17.929 --> 02:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
um forfeiting of property is a
 
02:23:20.570 --> 02:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
punishment and if somebody is going to
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
be punished they ought to have been
 
02:23:25.849 --> 02:23:25.859 align:start position:0%
proven as to be a criminal
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
um it it can't just be that you punish
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
somebody but there's no criminal act
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
been proven so
 
02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:35.160 align:start position:0%
um so what this particular Bill does
 
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1101 is just say to
 
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
prosecutors first of all it has no
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
effect on police officers what they do
 
02:23:45.770 --> 02:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
and so on they would still arrest people
 
02:23:47.809 --> 02:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
and seize property and so on just the
 
02:23:50.510 --> 02:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
same way they do now but it says to
 
02:23:50.520 --> 02:23:52.790 align:start position:0%
same way they do now but it says to
prosecutors

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
02:23:55.490 --> 02:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
um that you should prosecute people
 
02:23:58.610 --> 02:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law rather than
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
under federal law you should use our
 
02:24:03.650 --> 02:24:03.660 align:start position:0%
forfeiture law
 
02:24:03.660 --> 02:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
forfeiture law
and

02:24:05.030 --> 02:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:09.770 --> 02:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
um in in some cases so so in particular
 
02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:10.610 align:start position:0%
um in in some cases so so in particular
um

02:24:10.610 --> 02:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
federal law has this concept called
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
adoption I mean drug crimes typically
 
02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
drug crimes are both against state law
 
02:24:22.610 --> 02:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
they're also against federal law and so
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
a prosecutor has a choice when they
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
prosecute somebody can they process
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
which one do they use to prosecute them
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
and they can go to a federal prosecutor
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
and say how about taking this case and
 
02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
and Prosecuting under federal law and so
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
what this says is that unless the the
 
02:24:44.690 --> 02:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
the enforcement action was part of a
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
Joint Task Force between Federal
 
02:24:50.809 --> 02:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
officers and State uh local officers
 
02:24:53.450 --> 02:24:53.460 align:start position:0%
those kind of cases could be prosecuted
 
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
under federal law but if this was
 
02:24:57.889 --> 02:24:57.899 align:start position:0%
strictly done if the case was strictly
 
02:25:01.969 --> 02:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
prosecuted involves local police
 
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
officers or state police officers then
 
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
you must use state law that's what
 
02:25:08.690 --> 02:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill changes there
 
02:25:10.969 --> 02:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
would no longer be the option of of
 
02:25:15.889 --> 02:25:15.899 align:start position:0%
using federal law okay and so again the
 
02:25:18.370 --> 02:25:18.380 align:start position:0%
the reason that
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
prosecutors might choose federal law is
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
because of the lower burden of proof and
 
02:25:26.030 --> 02:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
so on
 
02:25:27.889 --> 02:25:27.899 align:start position:0%
um also
 
02:25:27.899 --> 02:25:28.790 align:start position:0%
um also
um

02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's incentives in federal law for
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
the local for for police officers
 
02:25:38.809 --> 02:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
because federal law at the end of the
 
02:25:41.690 --> 02:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
day takes 80 percent of seized for
 
02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
forfeited property and returns that to
 
02:25:44.819 --> 02:25:45.889 align:start position:0%
forfeited property and returns that to
to

02:25:45.889 --> 02:25:45.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:50.690 --> 02:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
um uh to local officers whereas local
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions whereas uh state law only
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
returns 45 percent of forfeited property
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
to local jurisdictions so there's
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
different incentives involved
 
02:26:05.929 --> 02:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
so this is this bill involves is
 
02:26:08.510 --> 02:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
important in terms of
 
02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
um principle right so the principle of
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
requiring a criminal conviction prior to
 
02:26:17.809 --> 02:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
forfeiture is what's involved here but
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
it there's not a lot of cases in turn a
 
02:26:22.190 --> 02:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
lot not a lot of money involved in in
 
02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:23.389 align:start position:0%
lot not a lot of money involved in in
this

02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:26:23.399 --> 02:26:24.650 align:start position:0%
this
um

02:26:24.650 --> 02:26:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
over the last three years there's been a
 
02:26:30.290 --> 02:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
total of 18 such cases that would be
 
02:26:34.130 --> 02:26:34.140 align:start position:0%
affected by this and 75 Joint Task Force
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
type of cases so that's a very tiny
 
02:26:39.889 --> 02:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
percentage the amount of money involved
 
02:26:42.370 --> 02:26:42.380 align:start position:0%
over the last three years has all
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
forfeited money was a hundred and
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
seventy two thousand dollars over three
 
02:26:48.770 --> 02:26:48.780 align:start position:0%
years right so we're talking about sixty
 
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year worth of
 
02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:51.950 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year worth of
forfeiture

02:26:51.950 --> 02:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
um

02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:55.610 --> 02:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
that would be affected by this bill and
 
02:26:57.889 --> 02:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
and that's over the entire state right
 
02:26:59.570 --> 02:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
so it we're not talking about a lot of
 
02:27:01.370 --> 02:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
money we are talking about a lot of
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
principle and I would ask you to pass
 
02:27:06.290 --> 02:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:27:08.450 --> 02:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for Mr
 
02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:11.150 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for Mr
McGuire

02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Horrigan
 
02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Mr chairman thank
 
02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
you good to see you again representative
 
02:27:21.290 --> 02:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
McGuire otherwise you're around the
 
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
State House more than many people who
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
are uh members of the uh still members
 
02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.439 align:start position:0%
of the legislature see
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
so you talk about the incentive to the
 
02:27:33.050 --> 02:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
police they get 80 percent of the
 
02:27:35.510 --> 02:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
federal seizures only 45 percent of the
 
02:27:37.610 --> 02:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
local jurisdictions the other 55 percent
 
02:27:41.630 --> 02:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
goes to various uh State funds so
 
02:27:44.450 --> 02:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
why is the why is it where why is it bad
 
02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
to for them to get 80
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
um instead of 45 percent
 
02:27:52.190 --> 02:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's thank you for the
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
question representative but I don't
 
02:27:56.330 --> 02:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
think that's the key Point here
 
02:27:56.340 --> 02:27:57.130 align:start position:0%
think that's the key Point here
um

02:27:57.130 --> 02:27:57.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:00.349 --> 02:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh that was a decision already made by
 
02:28:02.630 --> 02:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature when they made
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh therefore their forfeiture procedure
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
um the the key point I'm just saying why
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
somebody is why officers have an
 
02:28:15.650 --> 02:28:15.660 align:start position:0%
incentive to want to use federal law but
 
02:28:17.750 --> 02:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
the key point the reason behind this
 
02:28:21.770 --> 02:28:21.780 align:start position:0%
bill the ins the the is for fairness
 
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that we want to use
 
02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
state law over the years we've improved
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
state law we want to make use of state
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
law it's appropriate
 
02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:33.290 align:start position:0%
law it's appropriate
thanks

02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
02:28:35.270 --> 02:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:28:43.309 --> 02:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
and uh next person to testify would be
 
02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.650 --> 02:28:57.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:28:59.090 --> 02:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
committee for holding his hearing today
 
02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ross Connolly
 
02:29:02.690 --> 02:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy state director for
 
02:29:05.030 --> 02:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here in New
 
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh here to voice our support
 
02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
for HB 1101 this bill should be quite
 
02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
familiar to this committee uh it's
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
passed here a couple times uh and it's
 
02:29:18.889 --> 02:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
very similar language uh as before and
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
and we view this as a a
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
really an exercise and respecting
 
02:29:24.300 --> 02:29:25.429 align:start position:0%
really an exercise and respecting
federalism

02:29:25.429 --> 02:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
federalism
 
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
making sure that that law enforcement is
 
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
complying with state law while also
 
02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
giving them the ability to to continue
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
as as planned with Joint Task forces as
 
02:29:38.210 --> 02:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned I don't
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
want to repeat too much of what he said
 
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
but in 2016 this legislature passed the
 
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
law which required a conviction before
 
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
forfeiture proceedings could begin again
 
02:29:52.370 --> 02:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect seizures police can
 
02:29:55.010 --> 02:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
keep the same protocol they can seize
 
02:29:59.389 --> 02:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
property they can do continue as as
 
02:30:02.330 --> 02:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
they're performing now but uh in order
 
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
to Forfeit that property the state must
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh have a conviction and that RSA is 617
 
02:30:10.570 --> 02:30:10.580 align:start position:0%
colon 1-A
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
and and we view viewed that as a very
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
critical uh portion to to make sure that
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
due process is being protected and and
 
02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
property rights are being respected uh
 
02:30:26.990 --> 02:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
this bill specifically addresses the
 
02:30:29.690 --> 02:30:29.700 align:start position:0%
most obvious violation of that current
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
statute which is the federal adoptions
 
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
program under the Equitable sharing uh
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
program in the Federal Department of
 
02:30:40.550 --> 02:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
Justice uh as the previous speaker
 
02:30:42.050 --> 02:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
02:30:45.889 --> 02:30:45.899 align:start position:0%
those forfeitures only account for 19 of
 
02:30:47.929 --> 02:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
all forfeitures in the state over the
 
02:30:50.929 --> 02:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
past three years uh Joint Task forces
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
account for 81 which amounts for uh 172
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
073 dollars over three years Statewide
 
02:31:02.929 --> 02:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
and uh presuming all of those received
 
02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:05.160 align:start position:0%
convictions this would really only
 
02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
affect about twenty five thousand
 
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
dollars Statewide uh accounting for that
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
difference in in the 80 percent uh
 
02:31:14.450 --> 02:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
return to localities or the forty
 
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
percent forty five percent uh return to
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
localities so uh we view this as as a
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
very straightforward and modest change
 
02:31:24.770 --> 02:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that law enforcement
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
is is complying with with current state
 
02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
law uh and I'd be happy to take any
 
02:31:29.520 --> 02:31:31.670 align:start position:0%
law uh and I'd be happy to take any
questions

02:31:31.670 --> 02:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:31:36.889 --> 02:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:38.929 --> 02:31:38.939 align:start position:0%
see none I think you're clear thank you
 
02:31:41.389 --> 02:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time
 
02:31:54.050 --> 02:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
02:31:57.770 --> 02:31:57.780 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Joe Ebert it is
 
02:31:59.929 --> 02:31:59.939 align:start position:0%
e-b-e-r-t I'm a captain with the state
 
02:31:59.939 --> 02:32:01.130 align:start position:0%
e-b-e-r-t I'm a captain with the state
police

02:32:01.130 --> 02:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
police
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
and I oversee our Investigative Services
 
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
Bureau which is our Detectives
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
I have signed in today in opposition to
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
this bill and specifically I look at
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
that paragraph two you've heard an awful
 
02:32:15.230 --> 02:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony this morning about uh
 
02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
seizures and adoptions by federal
 
02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:20.570 align:start position:0%
seizures and adoptions by federal
prosecutors

02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
prosecutors
 
02:32:23.450 --> 02:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
I think what I took from maybe and
 
02:32:25.730 --> 02:32:25.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps incorrectly but this was my take
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
on the testimony that I heard was that
 
02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
um it seems as though there's a concern
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
02:32:34.010 --> 02:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
Federal the federal government is
 
02:32:36.830 --> 02:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
adopting cases for the sake of the
 
02:32:38.570 --> 02:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
forfeiture a greater amount of
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
forfeiture and I would submit to the
 
02:32:42.170 --> 02:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
committee that there is a number of
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why it may be advantageous for
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh a case to be prosecuted at the
 
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
federal level as opposed to the state
 
02:32:48.600 --> 02:32:50.030 align:start position:0%
federal level as opposed to the state
level

02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
02:32:52.910 --> 02:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
um so we we would certainly oppose this
 
02:32:56.750 --> 02:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
bill and have concern that the this
 
02:32:59.450 --> 02:32:59.460 align:start position:0%
there may be a coordination of events to
 
02:33:03.170 --> 02:33:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh first Force to use the state
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
forfeiture account and then in in later
 
02:33:09.290 --> 02:33:09.300 align:start position:0%
iterations of uh legislation to guide
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
where those funds go and what I would
 
02:33:14.510 --> 02:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
submit to you is that we we do utilize I
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
understand the testimony has been it's a
 
02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
small amount of money we take that money
 
02:33:19.790 --> 02:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
I talk to our business agent this
 
02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
morning and said what specifically do we
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
use this money for we specifically use
 
02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
it as it is intended to be for law
 
02:33:28.670 --> 02:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement enforcement purposes and
 
02:33:30.349 --> 02:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
almost all of the time it is placed
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
right back into the cycle of our
 
02:33:34.610 --> 02:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
narcotics unit so for the purchase of
 
02:33:36.410 --> 02:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
vehicles for the purchase of body wires
 
02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
for the purchase of other equipment so I
 
02:33:40.969 --> 02:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
would submit to you that a small amount
 
02:33:42.290 --> 02:33:42.300 align:start position:0%
of money what may be a small amount of
 
02:33:44.929 --> 02:33:44.939 align:start position:0%
money to members of the legislature or
 
02:33:47.990 --> 02:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh or or somebody else is a significant
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
amount to those of us who are working on
 
02:33:52.309 --> 02:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
a a very restrictive budget
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
so having said all that I'm happy to
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.349 --> 02:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative wolper
 
02:34:02.150 --> 02:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:34:03.290 --> 02:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
did I understand you to say that your
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
concern over this bill was where the
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
no the uh what I was uh trying to allude
 
02:34:15.950 --> 02:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
to Sir is uh I've testified uh in a
 
02:34:18.889 --> 02:34:18.899 align:start position:0%
number of years in the past uh over uh
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
where the direction of forfeitures may
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
or may not go and uh and in some cases
 
02:34:24.889 --> 02:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
have testified to what they may or may
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
not be used for uh what I was trying to
 
02:34:29.929 --> 02:34:29.939 align:start position:0%
allude to sir and uh although it's not
 
02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
germane specific to this bill my
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
opposition or the division of State
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
police's opposition is Bill is based on
 
02:34:37.610 --> 02:34:37.620 align:start position:0%
the notion that we feel like if a
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
federal prosecutor adopts this case then
 
02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
we should use the federal forfeiture
 
02:34:44.330 --> 02:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
program what I was saying was uh we do
 
02:34:46.130 --> 02:34:46.140 align:start position:0%
look at this in a long-term fashion as
 
02:34:49.190 --> 02:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
well to say uh is there an effort to
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
push the forfeitures toward the state
 
02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.370 align:start position:0%
push the forfeitures toward the state
side

02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
um with the eye on those funds for
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:03.650 --> 02:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:06.530 --> 02:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative trottier
 
02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you sir a
 
02:35:12.950 --> 02:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
quick question for you on the drug cases
 
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are a lot of those
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
turned over to a federal agent to
 
02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or are they usually done
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
within state law so I I appreciate the
 
02:35:21.720 --> 02:35:22.610 align:start position:0%
within state law so I I appreciate the
question

02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:22.620 --> 02:35:23.389 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:35:23.389 --> 02:35:23.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
a lot is a hard it's a hard term to
 
02:35:30.170 --> 02:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
quantify but they are adopted in some
 
02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
instances so an example that I can give
 
02:35:35.389 --> 02:35:35.399 align:start position:0%
you uh that in talking to our narcotics
 
02:35:37.250 --> 02:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
unit this morning is that well when does
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
this happen you explain this to me when
 
02:35:41.150 --> 02:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
when did these happen I've seen it a
 
02:35:42.650 --> 02:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
number of times but I never truly
 
02:35:44.889 --> 02:35:44.899 align:start position:0%
understood like well why does it happen
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
what may take place is our Troopers may
 
02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
be out on 95 and they may see two kilos
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
of cocaine and at some point there is a
 
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
discussion with the U.S attorney's
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
Office where the U.S attorney says this
 
02:35:59.570 --> 02:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
is a case that we believe is applicable
 
02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
to federal law and we would like to
 
02:36:03.950 --> 02:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
prosecute it so that does happen and in
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
that instance and as it relates to a
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
paragraph two there is no federal
 
02:36:10.130 --> 02:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
involvement in the seizure that is
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
strictly a state police case it is a
 
02:36:15.530 --> 02:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
state case until such time that the uh
 
02:36:17.570 --> 02:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
the U.S attorney comes in and says we
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
want to adopt this and it's our position
 
02:36:22.670 --> 02:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
that once that happens that we should
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
follow the Federal uh the federal system
 
02:36:26.809 --> 02:36:26.819 align:start position:0%
in other words we should go through the
 
02:36:29.150 --> 02:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
federal forfeiture program if we were in
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
the state proceedings at that time as I
 
02:36:32.809 --> 02:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
understand it we stopped that state
 
02:36:34.490 --> 02:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
proceeding and we now transfer it to the
 
02:36:36.170 --> 02:36:36.180 align:start position:0%
federal uh proceeding and we follow
 
02:36:38.450 --> 02:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
those guidelines thank you
 
02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
one more question
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
um would it be more common so if all of
 
02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
a sudden State Police or any
 
02:36:49.070 --> 02:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
unit that has a drug investigation and
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
it starts here in New Hampshire and it
 
02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
goes over state lines would that be a
 
02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
time that would be turned over to a
 
02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
federal agency to prosecute I think that
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the federal government certainly
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
looks at uh factors such as where where
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
to uh where did this narcotics come from
 
02:37:07.790 --> 02:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
proximity to the Border but I also think
 
02:37:09.590 --> 02:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
that they look at the uh the amount of
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
the seizure the weight of the seizure
 
02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:14.100 align:start position:0%
and what I would suggest to you is that
 
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
uh during these conversations uh they
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
they certainly happen uh above the the
 
02:37:20.570 --> 02:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
level of a captain and the state police
 
02:37:23.570 --> 02:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that uh I'm I'm
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
certain that the cases I'm aware of that
 
02:37:27.830 --> 02:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
have been adopted have been significant
 
02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
cases and I think that oftentimes that
 
02:37:33.349 --> 02:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
is when there is a large amount of
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
Narcotics we find that the U.S
 
02:37:38.030 --> 02:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's office is more interested in
 
02:37:39.710 --> 02:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
taking those cases and putting them
 
02:37:41.450 --> 02:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
through the federal system adopting them
 
02:37:42.590 --> 02:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
and putting them through the federal
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
system okay thank you
 
02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
one follow-up question so basically it's
 
02:37:49.130 --> 02:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
the logic cases that the federal agents
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
will prosecute then smaller that's been
 
02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
my experience I I can't remember ever uh
 
02:37:56.150 --> 02:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to say uh with
 
02:37:58.429 --> 02:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
definitive nature that it can happen but
 
02:38:00.889 --> 02:38:00.899 align:start position:0%
I don't remember ever seeing say a gram
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine case adopted by the U.S
 
02:38:04.969 --> 02:38:04.979 align:start position:0%
attorney's Office typically where we see
 
02:38:07.130 --> 02:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
these cases adopted is a significant
 
02:38:08.929 --> 02:38:08.939 align:start position:0%
amount of weight uh several kilos
 
02:38:10.969 --> 02:38:10.979 align:start position:0%
several pounds of some type of illicit
 
02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
narcotic great thank you thank you very
 
02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:15.050 align:start position:0%
narcotic great thank you thank you very
much

02:38:15.050 --> 02:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
um forfeiture cases and my if my memory
 
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
stirs me correctly
 
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:33.309 align:start position:0%
stirs me correctly
um

02:38:33.309 --> 02:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:35.389 --> 02:38:35.399 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:38:38.450 --> 02:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
entities in a federal entities
 
02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:39.770 align:start position:0%
entities in a federal entities
have

02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:40.849 align:start position:0%
have
um

02:38:40.849 --> 02:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
they have like a fund
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
that fortune Pro funds are sunk into and
 
02:38:50.870 --> 02:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what
 
02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:52.550 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what
typically

02:38:52.550 --> 02:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:53.570 align:start position:0%
typically
um

02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:54.849 align:start position:0%
um
State

02:38:54.849 --> 02:38:54.859 align:start position:0%
State
 
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
forfeiture money is how it's spent
 
02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah absolutely thank you
 
02:39:02.870 --> 02:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
ma'am for the question and uh yes I
 
02:39:04.670 --> 02:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
alluded to it before but I can give you
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
some specifics so uh we do have both a
 
02:39:09.950 --> 02:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
federal as well as a state forfeiture
 
02:39:11.389 --> 02:39:11.399 align:start position:0%
account and those are kept separate
 
02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
because there are separate guidelines uh
 
02:39:14.809 --> 02:39:14.819 align:start position:0%
dictating what we can and cannot do with
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
those funds but what they are mandated
 
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be utilized for is law enforcement
 
02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
purposes and what the state police uses
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
them for uh the vast majority of the
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
time is support of our narcotics unit
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
and that includes things that are
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
unexpected cost so we budget out for the
 
02:39:36.290 --> 02:39:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh clearly the the budget is put forward
 
02:39:38.690 --> 02:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
from the director that says hey we we
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
need five uh vehicles uh for this next
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
year however if uh on an icy road we
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
have a trooper who uh crashes that
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle and suddenly we need six
 
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
Vehicles we use that forfeiture fund to
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
account for un uh unanticipated cost for
 
02:39:58.070 --> 02:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
the enforcement of Narcotics and the
 
02:40:01.849 --> 02:40:01.859 align:start position:0%
same can be said for we have body wires
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
or cameras things that may reach end of
 
02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
life at a time we didn't expect and we
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
will utilize that money to purchase a
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
new body wire or a new camera for the
 
02:40:17.990 --> 02:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
I'm going to rephrase that there's a
 
02:40:34.969 --> 02:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
perception that forfeiture money goes to
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
the over militaryization of police
 
02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:39.050 align:start position:0%
the over militaryization of police
um

02:40:39.050 --> 02:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would you speak to that
 
02:40:43.790 --> 02:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
I mean we're talking about buying
 
02:40:45.889 --> 02:40:45.899 align:start position:0%
Bearcats and all other kinds of
 
02:40:48.770 --> 02:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
equipment almost you know War equipment
 
02:40:54.170 --> 02:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:56.690 --> 02:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that uh the the funding
 
02:40:59.150 --> 02:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
that we use we spend on our narcotics
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
unit so in terms of what somebody May
 
02:41:04.330 --> 02:41:04.340 align:start position:0%
deem as over military they say
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
militarization of law enforcement
 
02:41:10.190 --> 02:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that's somewhat subjective
 
02:41:12.349 --> 02:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you specifically things
 
02:41:15.590 --> 02:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we purchase so Vehicles body wires
 
02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh cameras surreptitious cameras that
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
are utilized in undercover cases that is
 
02:41:25.730 --> 02:41:25.740 align:start position:0%
the type of uh that is what that funding
 
02:41:28.969 --> 02:41:28.979 align:start position:0%
is used for I'm not aware of we have one
 
02:41:31.429 --> 02:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh armored personnel carrier which is
 
02:41:33.950 --> 02:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
the the State Police SWAT unit
 
02:41:36.050 --> 02:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
um bear I'm not aware of what would you
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
what was utilized what funds were
 
02:41:41.630 --> 02:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
utilized to purchase that although I
 
02:41:44.090 --> 02:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
my understanding and again I I tell I
 
02:41:45.950 --> 02:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
say this as my understanding of it and
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
not as fact is that that came through
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
grant money uh but in terms of uh
 
02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
purchasing say rifles uh or uh something
 
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
along those lines that may lead more to
 
02:41:59.150 --> 02:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
a military style uh level of enforcement
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any of these funds
 
02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
being utilized for that but I'm happy to
 
02:42:05.389 --> 02:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
if you have specific a specific question
 
02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
about a specific item that you think may
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
have been purchased I'm more than happy
 
02:42:11.270 --> 02:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
to research that present that to the
 
02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:13.969 align:start position:0%
to research that present that to the
committee

02:42:13.969 --> 02:42:13.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
is this fine now it is thank you I'm
 
02:42:25.610 --> 02:42:25.620 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for taking my question I
 
02:42:28.730 --> 02:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure I'm clear
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
forfeiture cannot occur unless a person
 
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
has been convicted and has been found
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
guilty of something is that arrogant no
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes that's my understanding of what the
 
02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh the previous iterations of house
 
02:42:44.809 --> 02:42:44.819 align:start position:0%
legislation was but I to be quite honest
 
02:42:46.610 --> 02:42:46.620 align:start position:0%
ma'am I didn't come prepared to speak on
 
02:42:48.050 --> 02:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
that point
 
02:42:49.790 --> 02:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
um but I but but again I'm happy to
 
02:42:52.010 --> 02:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
provide a statement to the committee uh
 
02:42:54.790 --> 02:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
that is definitive in nature okay
 
02:42:56.929 --> 02:42:56.939 align:start position:0%
this the second part of this question
 
02:42:59.450 --> 02:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to answer but if you
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
can research it I would appreciate it so
 
02:43:03.170 --> 02:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
that would mean
 
02:43:06.290 --> 02:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
that whatever was used in the commission
 
02:43:07.790 --> 02:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the crime
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
that could be forfeited that's the only
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
that's the only
 
02:43:12.660 --> 02:43:13.550 align:start position:0%
that's the only
um

02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.750 --> 02:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it at where I was thank
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
you understood thank you that's okay
 
02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:25.460 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
 
02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:29.570 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
chairman

02:43:29.570 --> 02:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to kind of get a a list from
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
you about what specifically
 
02:43:37.309 --> 02:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
um the fund has been used for in the
 
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
past I think like kind of a detailed
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
list past couple years of what it's been
 
02:43:42.530 --> 02:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
used for I think that'd be very valuable
 
02:43:44.270 --> 02:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
at least to me and maybe other members
 
02:43:45.889 --> 02:43:45.899 align:start position:0%
of the committee sure and representative
 
02:43:47.570 --> 02:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
your last name I apologize Alexander
 
02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
Alexander so uh
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
I will put that uh that request forward
 
02:43:55.309 --> 02:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the director to the kernel
 
02:43:58.010 --> 02:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
one thing I would ask you to consider
 
02:43:58.020 --> 02:43:58.790 align:start position:0%
one thing I would ask you to consider
um

02:43:58.790 --> 02:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:01.010 --> 02:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
you're asking for purchases over the
 
02:44:04.610 --> 02:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
last couple of years I I perceive that
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
there may be a concern over turning over
 
02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
the purchases of the last couple of
 
02:44:11.330 --> 02:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
years because of the covert nature of
 
02:44:12.650 --> 02:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
the equipment that they were purchasing
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you're looking to see what is
 
02:44:16.309 --> 02:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
purchased out of that account I think
 
02:44:18.530 --> 02:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
purchases that were made perhaps three
 
02:44:20.570 --> 02:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
or four years ago which are now no
 
02:44:22.929 --> 02:44:22.939 align:start position:0%
longer being utilized in a covert nature
 
02:44:26.410 --> 02:44:26.420 align:start position:0%
that is perhaps more easily elicit
 
02:44:28.790 --> 02:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
obtained that I can provide right and
 
02:44:30.889 --> 02:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
I'm not if it's covert like I'm not
 
02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
asking for specifics but maybe some like
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
General line items would be great or
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
something like that and I mean we're not
 
02:44:38.809 --> 02:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of like money
 
02:44:40.190 --> 02:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily I believe we're talking
 
02:44:42.170 --> 02:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
about 170
 
02:44:44.090 --> 02:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
000 over three years so it doesn't seem
 
02:44:45.370 --> 02:44:45.380 align:start position:0%
like the list might be that long
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
understood the question I'm asking I
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
will absolutely uh get that to you would
 
02:44:51.290 --> 02:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
you like that email to yourself or to
 
02:44:52.610 --> 02:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
02:44:54.170 --> 02:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
I believe the the whole committee would
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
be great
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
if not thank you Captain I thank you
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
very much for the opportunity to talk to
 
02:45:10.849 --> 02:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.250 --> 02:45:13.260 align:start position:0%
there are some other people who signed
 
02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
up I'm not sure that they are all here
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
but I see that our Committee Member
 
02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia is here would you
 
02:45:28.070 --> 02:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:45:31.730 --> 02:45:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Mike Sylvia
 
02:45:34.370 --> 02:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
representing belknap6 down in Belmont
 
02:45:36.469 --> 02:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
and and before you begin I want to
 
02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
apologize because I know you let us know
 
02:45:39.710 --> 02:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
that there would be difficulty with
 
02:45:41.809 --> 02:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
regard to timing and I didn't expect the
 
02:45:43.969 --> 02:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
prior hearing to go as long as it did so
 
02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
oh no and in fact we kind of assumed
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
that Criminal Justice having a fairly
 
02:45:51.110 --> 02:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
short schedule for their bills would be
 
02:45:52.969 --> 02:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
running overtime but they're not they're
 
02:45:56.210 --> 02:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
on time today so that's why there is a
 
02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
train going back and forth with some of
 
02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
the people that are testifying here I've
 
02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
got two bills over there one of them's
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
15 minutes into it so hopefully they
 
02:46:06.469 --> 02:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
haven't uh Gone looking for me yet I
 
02:46:07.790 --> 02:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
think they have all the folks there
 
02:46:10.130 --> 02:46:10.140 align:start position:0%
testifying in any case
 
02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:11.330 align:start position:0%
testifying in any case
um

02:46:11.330 --> 02:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to address
 
02:46:17.929 --> 02:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
um a concern in uh
 
02:46:20.809 --> 02:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
uh you know we we have worked on civil
 
02:46:24.050 --> 02:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
asset forfeiture over the years and the
 
02:46:26.530 --> 02:46:26.540 align:start position:0%
gentleman from Westmoreland has been
 
02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
very much involved in it is very very
 
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
much a bipartisan effort and we turned
 
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
our state law from civil asset
 
02:46:39.710 --> 02:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
forfeiture into criminal asset
 
02:46:39.720 --> 02:46:40.910 align:start position:0%
forfeiture into criminal asset
forfeiture

02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
 
02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:42.469 align:start position:0%
forfeiture
and

02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:45.590 --> 02:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
this is the the proper way to do
 
02:46:49.070 --> 02:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
forfeiture I certainly should be a crime
 
02:46:50.690 --> 02:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
and a conviction
 
02:46:54.170 --> 02:46:54.180 align:start position:0%
and in most cases that will happen with
 
02:46:57.770 --> 02:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
the state law that was passed in 2016 or
 
02:46:57.780 --> 02:46:59.150 align:start position:0%
the state law that was passed in 2016 or
18.

02:46:59.150 --> 02:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
18.
 
02:46:59.160 --> 02:46:59.870 align:start position:0%
18.
um

02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:04.010 --> 02:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
so the state has
 
02:47:06.770 --> 02:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
criminal asset forfeiture so
 
02:47:09.710 --> 02:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
this is the reason why we are looking at
 
02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
this Equitable sharing the adoption by
 
02:47:15.290 --> 02:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
the federal court because those go into
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
a civil process where a conviction is
 
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
not required
 
02:47:19.380 --> 02:47:20.929 align:start position:0%
not required
and

02:47:20.929 --> 02:47:20.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:23.929 --> 02:47:23.939 align:start position:0%
this is something that's been
 
02:47:26.990 --> 02:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
big throughout the country and the
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
institute for justice publishes a big
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
book of policing for profit
 
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
and this is something we want to avoid
 
02:47:37.250 --> 02:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
we don't want the image that our law
 
02:47:39.349 --> 02:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement are out you know building
 
02:47:40.809 --> 02:47:40.819 align:start position:0%
their own budgets
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh budgeting is is a an affair for the
 
02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
legislature or in the county the um the
 
02:47:51.950 --> 02:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
delegation or in the town level the uh
 
02:47:54.230 --> 02:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
the people vote on the budget and decide
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
how much that they want to fund to their
 
02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
so this money that goes through
 
02:48:03.469 --> 02:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh goes back to law
 
02:48:06.650 --> 02:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
enforcement and it is off budget it
 
02:48:08.210 --> 02:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
it does not go through the normal
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
budgeting process it is money that they
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
have restrictions on but it is within
 
02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
their own departments to decide how to
 
02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
spend that in in the best way to do that
 
02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:20.990 align:start position:0%
spend that in in the best way to do that
so

02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:23.830 --> 02:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh this bill that you've got this year
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
is slightly changed from last year we
 
02:48:30.490 --> 02:48:30.500 align:start position:0%
passed out of committee 18-2
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
it went through the house on Voice vote
 
02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:35.700 align:start position:0%
and ran into the folks on the other side
 
02:48:37.550 --> 02:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
of the wall
 
02:48:37.560 --> 02:48:38.210 align:start position:0%
of the wall
um

02:48:38.210 --> 02:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:42.110 --> 02:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
and so one of the objections uh uh to
 
02:48:45.969 --> 02:48:45.979 align:start position:0%
last year is Bill was a fairly arbitrary
 
02:48:49.570 --> 02:48:49.580 align:start position:0%
uh limit of 100 000
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
to cut off the adoption process and keep
 
02:48:57.650 --> 02:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
it in State uh the reality is that
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of forfeitures are
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
probably under ten thousand dollars
 
02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.889 align:start position:0%
probably under ten thousand dollars
and

02:49:06.889 --> 02:49:06.899 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:06.899 --> 02:49:08.090 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:49:08.090 --> 02:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
this is in a Range particularly if you
 
02:49:13.070 --> 02:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
put this into a federal process where
 
02:49:16.849 --> 02:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get very far in
 
02:49:19.190 --> 02:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
legal fees before you chew up everything
 
02:49:21.230 --> 02:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
02:49:21.240 --> 02:49:21.950 align:start position:0%
that has been
um

02:49:21.950 --> 02:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:24.410 --> 02:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
taken and so a lot of that is just
 
02:49:26.570 --> 02:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
forfeited it's just it's not even fought
 
02:49:29.389 --> 02:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
for they just walk away from it it's a
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
default and you know and so that you
 
02:49:35.270 --> 02:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
never get to the the point of finding
 
02:49:37.250 --> 02:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
out whether or not there was actually a
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
crime involved so I think this is an
 
02:49:42.349 --> 02:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
important bill I think we need to bring
 
02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
it back to the other side of the wall
 
02:49:48.770 --> 02:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
and uh and perhaps uh have them take
 
02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:56.330 --> 02:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:03.410 --> 02:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
we do have other people who signed up
 
02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:08.220 align:start position:0%
Joshua Albert who indicated he opposes
 
02:50:14.570 --> 02:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm presuming that's the case there's uh
 
02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:28.070 --> 02:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
I guess what I asked the committee is uh
 
02:50:29.990 --> 02:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you want to recess the hearing or
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
close the hearing at this point in time
 
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
do you think we've heard sufficient
 
02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:39.950 align:start position:0%
do you think we've heard sufficient
testimony

02:50:39.950 --> 02:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
I think so I do
 
02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh we'll close the hearing
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
02:50:46.319 --> 02:50:50.990 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
1101

02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:52.969 --> 02:50:52.979 align:start position:0%
and those people who perhaps didn't have
 
02:50:54.590 --> 02:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify can submit
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and we will be in recess for lunch and
 
02:51:09.050 --> 02:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
reconvene at one o'clock
 
02:51:19.450 --> 02:51:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:22.490 --> 02:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
that I lost and I was battling my way
 
02:51:25.130 --> 02:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
through do one of those cards at all
 
02:51:28.490 --> 02:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
those are the people who didn't testify
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
keep them fire we'll be part of the
 
02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
permanent record
 
02:51:36.349 --> 02:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:36.359 --> 02:51:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
hi

02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
hi
 
02:51:38.520 --> 02:56:17.210 align:start position:0%
hi
okay

02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:19.370 --> 02:56:19.380 align:start position:0%
it's red like that see
 
02:56:19.380 --> 04:02:06.309 align:start position:0%
it's red like that see
okay

04:02:06.309 --> 04:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.769 --> 04:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
thank you so thank you so much Mr chair
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
and thank you honorable members for
 
04:02:14.809 --> 04:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
welcoming me to your committee
 
04:02:16.610 --> 04:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Ellen Reed
 
04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
I represent Newmarket newfields
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 17. and I have for you today
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh HB 1107
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
and I want to give you just a little bit
 
04:02:30.050 --> 04:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
of history on this bill a couple years
 
04:02:32.750 --> 04:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
ago I put in a bill that was not a study
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
committee version but an actual version
 
04:02:40.010 --> 04:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
uh that would have basically the broad
 
04:02:42.710 --> 04:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
point is to make it so that landlords
 
04:02:46.610 --> 04:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
cannot arbitrarily uh deny uh people
 
04:02:49.849 --> 04:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
renting who have pets there were a lot
 
04:02:52.250 --> 04:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
of concessions to landlords in terms of
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
well what if an animal is disruptive or
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
what have you however the Committees
 
04:02:58.370 --> 04:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
certainly felt that it was a very
 
04:03:00.650 --> 04:03:00.660 align:start position:0%
complex issue and
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
um it did appear at that point that the
 
04:03:04.130 --> 04:03:04.140 align:start position:0%
committee was going to adopt a study
 
04:03:07.130 --> 04:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
committee amendment to that bill but
 
04:03:08.689 --> 04:03:08.699 align:start position:0%
instead a non-germaine amendment was
 
04:03:11.210 --> 04:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
adopted instead so I have this before
 
04:03:13.849 --> 04:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
you now with the study committee in the
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
study committee version and so I'll just
 
04:03:19.070 --> 04:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get into the meat of this
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
the first piece is I believe you've
 
04:03:23.210 --> 04:03:23.220 align:start position:0%
received testimony in support of this
 
04:03:25.910 --> 04:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill from several organizations a few of
 
04:03:28.729 --> 04:03:28.739 align:start position:0%
them being the AKC an organization
 
04:03:31.610 --> 04:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
called dogs hsus Humane Society of the
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
United States ASPCA best friends no kill
 
04:03:37.070 --> 04:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
advocacy and I just want to point out
 
04:03:40.130 --> 04:03:40.140 align:start position:0%
kind of the little small miracle in this
 
04:03:42.410 --> 04:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
because and I don't know if these
 
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
organizations frequently testify in this
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
committee but there is virtually no
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
issue whatsoever where the AKC and dogs
 
04:03:54.889 --> 04:03:54.899 align:start position:0%
agree with the SPCA and Humane Society
 
04:03:57.530 --> 04:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
they are always always always at odds
 
04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
and both of the directors of those
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
respective organizations were astonished
 
04:04:03.950 --> 04:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they were on the same side on an
 
04:04:03.960 --> 04:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
that they were on the same side on an
issue

04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:04:07.790 --> 04:04:07.800 align:start position:0%
so this particular issue I know that
 
04:04:10.370 --> 04:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
members in our body are in general
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
sometimes reticent to pass a study
 
04:04:13.500 --> 04:04:14.630 align:start position:0%
sometimes reticent to pass a study
committee

04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue and I understand
 
04:04:17.870 --> 04:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
that because there's a lot of issues
 
04:04:20.689 --> 04:04:20.699 align:start position:0%
that have been studied ad nauseam but
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that has never been
 
04:04:25.389 --> 04:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
studied in this state
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
certainly there are states and other
 
04:04:30.650 --> 04:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
locations that have kind of trailblazed
 
04:04:32.870 --> 04:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
for us and have done some of the hard
 
04:04:34.670 --> 04:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
work and studying done some of the hard
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
work in passing legislation different
 
04:04:40.670 --> 04:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
forms of legislation on this issue but
 
04:04:42.410 --> 04:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
we have not studied it in the
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
particulars of our state so I do feel is
 
04:04:46.689 --> 04:04:46.699 align:start position:0%
very important to study
 
04:04:49.189 --> 04:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of other locations California
 
04:04:52.969 --> 04:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
and Illinois have both put a ban on no
 
04:04:55.809 --> 04:04:55.819 align:start position:0%
pets Clauses when it comes to
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
state-funded housing any any kind of
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
housing that receives any kind of
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
subsidy Massachusetts has pushed forward
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
on a ban in regards to certain types of
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
dogs Oregon has a complete ban on no on
 
04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
a no pets Clause Ontario has a complete
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
ban and that one's in particular is very
 
04:05:16.790 --> 04:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
interesting because we have data that
 
04:05:19.250 --> 04:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
shows before the ban
 
04:05:21.530 --> 04:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
um there's pet surrenders to their
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
shelters 25 percent of them were due to
 
04:05:26.210 --> 04:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
housing issues and after the ban that
 
04:05:28.570 --> 04:05:28.580 align:start position:0%
dropped to six percent
 
04:05:32.689 --> 04:05:32.699 align:start position:0%
Australia has a ban and in Australia I
 
04:05:34.550 --> 04:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
kind of and I didn't find out about this
 
04:05:37.490 --> 04:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
until after I put in the first bill so
 
04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
just recently Australia's legislation or
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
their law now says that a tenant must
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
get the landlord approval but the
 
04:05:48.650 --> 04:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
landlord cannot reasonably deny approval
 
04:05:50.330 --> 04:05:50.340 align:start position:0%
and if the landlord wants to deny it the
 
04:05:53.689 --> 04:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
landlord has to to show a reason why so
 
04:05:55.250 --> 04:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
I kind of actually like it's a bit of an
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
elegant solution I think
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
but let me talk about the reasons why
 
04:06:01.550 --> 04:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
this should be studied and why this is
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
an issue the idea of getting red rid of
 
04:06:08.689 --> 04:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
the no pets clause in lease is first of
 
04:06:10.550 --> 04:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
all and most Obviously good for pets
 
04:06:13.370 --> 04:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's the number housing issues is the
 
04:06:15.349 --> 04:06:15.359 align:start position:0%
number one reason pets are surrendered
 
04:06:19.490 --> 04:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
to shelters which are a burden on on our
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
community at Large
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
and it's the number one reason that
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
people give that for not adopting
 
04:06:27.410 --> 04:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
animals or taking in more animals so
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
it's a huge burden on shelters and this
 
04:06:31.969 --> 04:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
has actually been going up the the
 
04:06:34.189 --> 04:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
concern about housing when it relates to
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
pets has been something that's been
 
04:06:35.880 --> 04:06:37.790 align:start position:0%
pets has been something that's been
increasing

04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
getting rid of no pet Clauses is
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
actually good for people as well not
 
04:06:44.210 --> 04:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
Just Pets companion animals
 
04:06:47.870 --> 04:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so as we probably have all heard but
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
many data's many Studies have shown that
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
companion animals substantially improve
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular and mental health and
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
especially in this time when many many
 
04:06:59.510 --> 04:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
people are suffering from effects of
 
04:06:59.520 --> 04:07:01.610 align:start position:0%
people are suffering from effects of
isolation

04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
isolation
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
um also further more and more people are
 
04:07:06.290 --> 04:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
choosing not to have children and more
 
04:07:08.870 --> 04:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
and more people are living longer and
 
04:07:10.969 --> 04:07:10.979 align:start position:0%
those are both factors that lead to more
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
isolated Lifestyles and in both of those
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
populations greatly benefit and intend
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
to actually embrace pet ownership
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
I would like to quote here there was a
 
04:07:24.110 --> 04:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
in 1981 under the Reagan Administration
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
there was a national White House
 
04:07:28.130 --> 04:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
conference on Aging
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and they address the problem of
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
elderly people having to choose between
 
04:07:33.830 --> 04:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
housing that they could afford and their
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
companion animals and and this
 
04:07:38.150 --> 04:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
conference actually in the report
 
04:07:39.950 --> 04:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
um and again this was 1981 they framed
 
04:07:42.110 --> 04:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
it as a civil rights issue the quote is
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
the forced separation of older persons
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
from their companion animals upon
 
04:07:48.889 --> 04:07:48.899 align:start position:0%
entering housing projects for the
 
04:07:51.950 --> 04:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
elderly inflicts immeasurable emotional
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
suffering and often leads to severe
 
04:07:56.929 --> 04:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
psychological trauma and consequent
 
04:07:59.050 --> 04:07:59.060 align:start position:0%
mental and physical deterioration
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
including the loss of the will to live
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
the comfort of a companion animal is a
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
civil right not to be denied to
 
04:08:09.710 --> 04:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
responsible pet owners again that is
 
04:08:12.650 --> 04:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
quote from the Reagan Administration
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
conference on Aging
 
04:08:17.090 --> 04:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue that doesn't only
 
04:08:18.670 --> 04:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
affect the Aged
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
and obviously we've already given many
 
04:08:24.590 --> 04:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh considerations to people with
 
04:08:27.469 --> 04:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
um therapy dogs or therapy animals for
 
04:08:29.809 --> 04:08:29.819 align:start position:0%
certain disabilities but it affects
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much everyone who has animals
 
04:08:35.689 --> 04:08:35.699 align:start position:0%
and so we already have a protected class
 
04:08:38.269 --> 04:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
where animals have to be allowed in but
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
there are so many people that benefit
 
04:08:42.170 --> 04:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
substantially physically and emotionally
 
04:08:45.110 --> 04:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
from having animals
 
04:08:47.750 --> 04:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
um so in further it's not only good for
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
the pet owner themselves but Studies
 
04:08:52.670 --> 04:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
have shown and I will be sending you all
 
04:08:54.110 --> 04:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
of my references so you can see those
 
04:08:55.729 --> 04:08:55.739 align:start position:0%
studies and you're not just taking my
 
04:08:58.250 --> 04:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
word there's studies but Studies have
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
shown that communities that allow more
 
04:09:03.110 --> 04:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
pets report greater overall happiness
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
and social cohesion so it's actually
 
04:09:08.450 --> 04:09:08.460 align:start position:0%
good for the whole community and when
 
04:09:11.809 --> 04:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
surveyed most tenants regardless of
 
04:09:13.729 --> 04:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
whether they personally wanted to have a
 
04:09:16.309 --> 04:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
pet most tenants overwhelmingly support
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
allowing pets
 
04:09:20.330 --> 04:09:20.340 align:start position:0%
further not only is it good for the
 
04:09:22.010 --> 04:09:22.020 align:start position:0%
animals and good for people in general
 
04:09:25.130 --> 04:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
but it's actually good for landlords now
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
hear me out first of all 47 of housing
 
04:09:30.180 --> 04:09:30.710 align:start position:0%
hear me out first of all 47 of housing
um

04:09:30.710 --> 04:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:33.650 --> 04:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
allows for pets so it's less than half
 
04:09:36.469 --> 04:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
but 47 percent is fairly substantial
 
04:09:39.110 --> 04:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's enough to to draw data from and so
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
we know that with 47 of percent of
 
04:09:44.450 --> 04:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
landlords allowing for housing for
 
04:09:46.849 --> 04:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
people with pets that it is something
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
that continues to be lucrative it is
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
something that's doable it's not
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
something that's unfeasible
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
um on average and again I have the
 
04:09:56.689 --> 04:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
studies that I'll send you pet owners do
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
not cause on average any more damage
 
04:10:01.370 --> 04:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
than non-pet owning tenants
 
04:10:03.710 --> 04:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
and uh so they're responsible and
 
04:10:05.450 --> 04:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
irresponsible people
 
04:10:07.250 --> 04:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
that have pets and don't have pets
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's it's spread uh across the board
 
04:10:13.790 --> 04:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
and but not only that so most pets do
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
not cause damage of the damage that is
 
04:10:19.250 --> 04:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
done by pets most of that damage is
 
04:10:20.990 --> 04:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
within the normal security deposit again
 
04:10:24.050 --> 04:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
I will send you those studies
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
um furthermore pets don't cause any more
 
04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
damage than children so just anecdotally
 
04:10:32.450 --> 04:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I I no longer have children that
 
04:10:34.610 --> 04:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
live above me but I cannot tell you how
 
04:10:35.929 --> 04:10:35.939 align:start position:0%
many times I've laid on the couch
 
04:10:37.610 --> 04:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
reading a book with my cat curled up
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
quietly on my chest while I'm listening
 
04:10:42.469 --> 04:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
to Children running back and forth
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
screaming and the mom yelling at them to
 
04:10:46.849 --> 04:10:46.859 align:start position:0%
stop fighting and then there's toys
 
04:10:49.550 --> 04:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
strewn about in our communal areas
 
04:10:53.389 --> 04:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
so again children are protected but but
 
04:10:55.250 --> 04:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
people with pets are not even though
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
that's become more and more of an option
 
04:11:02.330 --> 04:11:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.370 --> 04:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
by the way children are protected
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
because of a federal
 
04:11:06.359 --> 04:11:07.269 align:start position:0%
because of a federal
um

04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
status called familial status but again
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
people choose not to have children and
 
04:11:16.490 --> 04:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
choose to have pets instead of children
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
and that should be their right so in a
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
very serious way this means landlords
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
are unreasonably interfering with
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
private family decisions
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
again if the pet owner is responsible if
 
04:11:32.030 --> 04:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
the pet owner is not causing any damage
 
04:11:33.650 --> 04:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
is not causing any problems with other
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
tenants then why should the landlord
 
04:11:40.990 --> 04:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
also getting rid of no pets arbitrary no
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
pets Clauses is good for the housing
 
04:11:48.889 --> 04:11:48.899 align:start position:0%
good for housing in general when we're
 
04:11:51.229 --> 04:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
having a housing issue right now and the
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
housing market because it means that
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
everyone not only people who don't have
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
pets but everyone has access to the full
 
04:11:59.150 --> 04:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
range of the housing market that's in
 
04:12:01.550 --> 04:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
their budget which helps people secure
 
04:12:03.769 --> 04:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
housing that is responsibly within their
 
04:12:06.469 --> 04:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
means but also it helps competition in
 
04:12:09.170 --> 04:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
the overall housing market
 
04:12:11.330 --> 04:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
also it helps the economy in general
 
04:12:13.849 --> 04:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
because pet ownership is a multi-billion
 
04:12:15.530 --> 04:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
dollar industry that supports the
 
04:12:18.349 --> 04:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
economy and when we say people are not
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to have pets or face eviction
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
then that means we're dampening that
 
04:12:23.040 --> 04:12:28.010 align:start position:0%
then that means we're dampening that
industry

04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.020 --> 04:12:30.830 align:start position:0%
 
ah

04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
so anyway people should not have to
 
04:12:35.389 --> 04:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
choose between having a roof over their
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
heads and keeping a valued member of
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
their family especially one that brings
 
04:12:42.950 --> 04:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
them comfort and companionship there are
 
04:12:44.570 --> 04:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
multiple options like I glossed over
 
04:12:47.150 --> 04:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
earlier but we have a lot of places that
 
04:12:49.070 --> 04:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
are doing things and so these are the
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
types of things that we can study in a
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
study committee how other places are
 
04:12:55.670 --> 04:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
doing it and also the stakeholders in
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
our state for example I did mention
 
04:13:00.110 --> 04:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
Australia has this no unreasonable
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
denial clause which is a really kind of
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
elegant simple easy way to address the
 
04:13:05.279 --> 04:13:06.550 align:start position:0%
elegant simple easy way to address the
situation

04:13:06.550 --> 04:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
situation
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
but I think we can also study a very
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
clear process that might involve things
 
04:13:14.210 --> 04:13:14.220 align:start position:0%
like screening inspections monitoring of
 
04:13:16.490 --> 04:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
complaints from other tenants and a
 
04:13:19.250 --> 04:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
warning system to protect the landlord
 
04:13:21.530 --> 04:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
and enable the landlord to quickly deal
 
04:13:22.910 --> 04:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
with anything that might potentially
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
become a problem we can also look into
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
things like limiting it only to cats and
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
dogs possibly animals that are contained
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
to an closure requiring vaccinations
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
requiring spay and neuter requiring that
 
04:13:38.570 --> 04:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
the animal is indoors all the time in
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the case of dogs requiring insurance and
 
04:13:43.550 --> 04:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
also the idea of just simply limiting
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
pet deposits and making them refundable
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
so after all this we know these things
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
for sure this is definitely an issue for
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
a huge number of people in this state
 
04:13:57.130 --> 04:13:57.140 align:start position:0%
especially in our current housing crisis
 
04:13:59.689 --> 04:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
and it further limits people's ability
 
04:14:01.849 --> 04:14:01.859 align:start position:0%
to find housing we also know people are
 
04:14:03.410 --> 04:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
happier and healthier with their
 
04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
companion animals and we know that
 
04:14:06.410 --> 04:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
animals are happier and healthier with
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
their people
 
04:14:09.410 --> 04:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
we know that this is something that a
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
lot of places are already doing the
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
pioneering work for us and we know that
 
04:14:14.689 --> 04:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have never
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
studied so for all those reasons I ask
 
04:14:19.790 --> 04:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
that this committee support a study
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm happy to take
 
04:14:21.120 --> 04:14:22.849 align:start position:0%
committee and I'm happy to take
questions

04:14:22.849 --> 04:14:22.859 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed are there
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
 
04:14:33.050 --> 04:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
04:14:34.969 --> 04:14:34.979 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill to us
 
04:14:36.469 --> 04:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:14:38.450 --> 04:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
um last term last year we had a bill
 
04:14:41.269 --> 04:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
that would just um full-on prohibit
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination that you sponsored and
 
04:14:44.870 --> 04:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
sent to us and that was passed out of
 
04:14:47.450 --> 04:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
committee eventually tabled on the floor
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
of the house and from what my knowledge
 
04:14:52.010 --> 04:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
or previous knowledge of this is that
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of compromise
 
04:14:54.550 --> 04:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment between
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
landlords and you or some other group
 
04:14:59.410 --> 04:14:59.420 align:start position:0%
that was that was
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
proposed and eventually passed but the
 
04:15:03.950 --> 04:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
bill was tabled on the floor can you and
 
04:15:03.960 --> 04:15:04.610 align:start position:0%
bill was tabled on the floor can you and
um

04:15:04.610 --> 04:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:06.650 --> 04:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
when it was tabled last year you voted
 
04:15:08.330 --> 04:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
to table it I guess what I'm wondering
 
04:15:10.910 --> 04:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
is what the process why you chose to do
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
that and then also
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
um what else are We additionally going
 
04:15:16.370 --> 04:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
to learn from a study committee that we
 
04:15:18.410 --> 04:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
didn't already discuss last year when
 
04:15:19.670 --> 04:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
this bill came to us well actually it
 
04:15:22.010 --> 04:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
was the landlord's Association that went
 
04:15:23.809 --> 04:15:23.819 align:start position:0%
into great detail about how we hadn't
 
04:15:25.429 --> 04:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
studied this issue and that there was
 
04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
all this data that we needed to look
 
04:15:29.950 --> 04:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
into about how landlords are impacted
 
04:15:32.150 --> 04:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
the studies that I'm going to send you
 
04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
tend to show that landlords in general
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
when they complain about pet damages
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
exaggerate when compared to actual costs
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
exaggerate the Damage Done but there
 
04:15:42.889 --> 04:15:42.899 align:start position:0%
were stories from that term of pets
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
doing like a single dog doing like a
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars damage right so
 
04:15:47.630 --> 04:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
these are things that we definitely need
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
to look into and obviously the health
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
and well-being of people we didn't go
 
04:15:52.309 --> 04:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
into those studies specifically for the
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
state and the housing issue but in terms
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
of what happened the amendment that I
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
was working on with my groups and the
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
Landlord Association we did try to work
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
on an amendment together and that was
 
04:16:04.550 --> 04:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
the study committee that one was not
 
04:16:06.290 --> 04:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
what was adopted and that was not what
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
was on the floor what ended up being on
 
04:16:10.189 --> 04:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
the floor was a non-germaine amendment
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
that completely removed any mention of
 
04:16:14.450 --> 04:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
pets whatsoever and simply raised with
 
04:16:16.729 --> 04:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
no limit security deposits not pet
 
04:16:18.650 --> 04:16:18.660 align:start position:0%
security deposits security deposits
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
something The Landlord Association has
 
04:16:22.010 --> 04:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
been Desiring for a long time so it had
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
they used my bill as a vehicle for what
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do so that is why I posed
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
it on the floor and gave the unfortunate
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
speech of saying I'm asking for this
 
04:16:33.170 --> 04:16:33.180 align:start position:0%
chamber to vote against my bill but uh
 
04:16:36.110 --> 04:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
no that was it was the the bill on the
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
floor that I supported tabling was not
 
04:16:39.710 --> 04:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I had worked with the
 
04:16:41.389 --> 04:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
Landlord Association on that was the
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:48.050 --> 04:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:49.729 --> 04:16:49.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
the next person who has filed a pink
 
04:17:07.250 --> 04:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:08.809 --> 04:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
thank you very much committee for having
 
04:17:11.809 --> 04:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
me speak today appreciate it very much I
 
04:17:15.370 --> 04:17:15.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:20.510 --> 04:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm with the
 
04:17:37.849 --> 04:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you're not unfamiliar with me
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm with the apartment association of
 
04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and director for
 
04:17:43.490 --> 04:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
legislative affairs for landlords across
 
04:17:45.889 --> 04:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
the state involving landlord tenant
 
04:17:45.899 --> 04:17:47.210 align:start position:0%
the state involving landlord tenant
issues

04:17:47.210 --> 04:17:47.220 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:17:49.130 --> 04:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
every season
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
so we're in opposition to the bill
 
04:17:55.849 --> 04:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
this was talked about a lot the last
 
04:17:58.689 --> 04:17:58.699 align:start position:0%
time the original bill came through
 
04:17:58.699 --> 04:18:00.349 align:start position:0%
time the original bill came through
and

04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:18:00.359 --> 04:18:04.070 align:start position:0%
and
pets

04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
often cause a large amount of damage to
 
04:18:08.330 --> 04:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
the property
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
so forcing a landlord
 
04:18:13.990 --> 04:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
to accept a pet
 
04:18:17.030 --> 04:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
would have you know extreme consequences
 
04:18:17.040 --> 04:18:18.050 align:start position:0%
would have you know extreme consequences
to

04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
the housing
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
is often the case I would disagree with
 
04:18:26.090 --> 04:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker about damages it's
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
often the case that a pet in an
 
04:18:28.199 --> 04:18:29.269 align:start position:0%
often the case that a pet in an
apartment

04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
causes some damage sometimes that is
 
04:18:35.210 --> 04:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
covered by the security deposit
 
04:18:37.969 --> 04:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
other times not at all
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
when a pet is urinating and
 
04:18:43.680 --> 04:18:44.809 align:start position:0%
when a pet is urinating and
um

04:18:44.809 --> 04:18:44.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:47.150 --> 04:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
pooping in the apartment and you get
 
04:18:49.250 --> 04:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
smell and
 
04:18:52.330 --> 04:18:52.340 align:start position:0%
things leaking into the woodwork
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes you have to pull up and
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
replace flooring it would be very common
 
04:18:59.510 --> 04:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
to have to replace carpeting sometimes
 
04:19:01.189 --> 04:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
that gets into the wood
 
04:19:04.490 --> 04:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
some of our members really have spent
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars on one family that
 
04:19:10.429 --> 04:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
have had a pet that was irresponsible
 
04:19:13.309 --> 04:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
with their their ownership
 
04:19:16.189 --> 04:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's also the case that
 
04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
some percentage of people are allergic
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
to pets
 
04:19:23.150 --> 04:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
they can't live in an apartment where
 
04:19:25.250 --> 04:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
there has been an animal
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
no matter what you do for cleaning
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
some people are allergic enough that
 
04:19:31.130 --> 04:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
they actually
 
04:19:34.490 --> 04:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
could be risking death or extreme
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
physical medical consequences that might
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
be on the rare side but there's a very
 
04:19:43.130 --> 04:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
large number of people that are allergic
 
04:19:46.250 --> 04:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
to dander and and pets and they don't
 
04:19:48.830 --> 04:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
want to have to live in a building where
 
04:19:50.929 --> 04:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
there is a pet or in an apartment where
 
04:19:53.570 --> 04:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
there was a pet
 
04:19:56.870 --> 04:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
the recovery of damages from a tenant in
 
04:19:59.090 --> 04:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
our court system is practically
 
04:19:59.100 --> 04:20:01.070 align:start position:0%
our court system is practically
impossible

04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
when a tenant leaves and they've created
 
04:20:03.060 --> 04:20:04.130 align:start position:0%
when a tenant leaves and they've created
damage

04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
damage
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
you try to do small claims it's almost
 
04:20:10.150 --> 04:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
impossible to collect on that
 
04:20:12.590 --> 04:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
damage and there's certainly not enough
 
04:20:15.229 --> 04:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
security deposit to cover the damage
 
04:20:18.530 --> 04:20:18.540 align:start position:0%
that often is caused by a pet
 
04:20:20.269 --> 04:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is
 
04:20:22.910 --> 04:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
what about emergencies and you have a
 
04:20:25.070 --> 04:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
defensive dog in the apartment the
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
landlord is trying to handle an
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
emergency but you can't get in because
 
04:20:31.729 --> 04:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:34.309 --> 04:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
and what about all the other tenants in
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
the property that are complaining
 
04:20:39.349 --> 04:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a dog barking or the the
 
04:20:41.689 --> 04:20:41.699 align:start position:0%
owner doesn't pick up after their dog on
 
04:20:44.809 --> 04:20:44.819 align:start position:0%
the property and you've given many many
 
04:20:47.090 --> 04:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
warnings but you can't remedy the
 
04:20:49.729 --> 04:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
behavior and then it's a two-month
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
eviction period after all of those
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
warnings and then all the other tenants
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
have to put up with that
 
04:20:58.849 --> 04:20:58.859 align:start position:0%
forcing a landlord to accept pets or
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
Bridges the owner's rights to screen
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
tenants and to create a quiet enjoyment
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
if the bill if it turns out that the
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
legislature comes up with a plan that
 
04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
forces landlords to accept pets
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to increase the cost
 
04:21:24.110 --> 04:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
of managing the property taking care of
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the property all those costs are going
 
04:21:29.389 --> 04:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
to be turned back into higher rents it's
 
04:21:31.490 --> 04:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
going to exacerbate the affordable
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
housing issue that we have
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs will rise because of the
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
we need to be putting our effort into
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
creating more affordable housing
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
not worsening the housing
 
04:21:54.650 --> 04:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
affordability that we already have
 
04:21:57.110 --> 04:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
we think that the original bill was a
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
very bad idea we think that there's no
 
04:22:01.070 --> 04:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
good that can come from a study
 
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
committee because the idea of forcing
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
owners to accept pets is just a bad idea
 
04:22:08.710 --> 04:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
is going to create
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
liabilities expenses
 
04:22:15.070 --> 04:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
increased insurance
 
04:22:17.809 --> 04:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
less enjoyment for the other tenants in
 
04:22:20.210 --> 04:22:20.220 align:start position:0%
the property and
 
04:22:22.370 --> 04:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
I I don't see any good that could come
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
from even studying it I would be very
 
04:22:29.450 --> 04:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Mr Norman
 
04:22:33.889 --> 04:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
yes representative page
 
04:22:36.290 --> 04:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Norman for taking my
 
04:22:38.689 --> 04:22:38.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
04:22:44.630 --> 04:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that she had studies I
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
believe that sort of supported some of
 
04:22:49.729 --> 04:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
her statements and she was going to send
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
those to this committee
 
04:22:54.290 --> 04:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering to what extent you have
 
04:22:57.290 --> 04:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
similar studies that might support some
 
04:22:59.570 --> 04:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the statements that you have here I
 
04:23:02.269 --> 04:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
have testimony from landlords and my own
 
04:23:02.279 --> 04:23:03.469 align:start position:0%
have testimony from landlords and my own
experience

04:23:03.469 --> 04:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:23:05.450 --> 04:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
but I don't have studies
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
actually it's not an issue that I've
 
04:23:09.170 --> 04:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
studied and researched in that kind of a
 
04:23:09.180 --> 04:23:09.950 align:start position:0%
studied and researched in that kind of a
way

04:23:09.950 --> 04:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:23:12.469 --> 04:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
but I have plenty of experience in the
 
04:23:15.650 --> 04:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
industry so it's it's largely your
 
04:23:17.330 --> 04:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
anecdotes right
 
04:23:20.689 --> 04:23:20.699 align:start position:0%
from my constituent landlords and I talk
 
04:23:21.950 --> 04:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
with the landlords thousands of
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
landlords across the state okay and plus
 
04:23:26.750 --> 04:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
I have my own 48 units
 
04:23:28.729 --> 04:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
I would be very interested to have the
 
04:23:31.439 --> 04:23:32.510 align:start position:0%
I would be very interested to have the
studies

04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
studies
 
04:23:32.520 --> 04:23:34.010 align:start position:0%
studies
if

04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:23:36.530 --> 04:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah that'd be awesome yeah just focus
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
on the committee if you would thanks
 
04:23:41.269 --> 04:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and
 
04:23:43.910 --> 04:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Nutter thank
 
04:23:45.410 --> 04:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking the
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you isn't it true that
 
04:23:50.330 --> 04:23:50.340 align:start position:0%
there's also uh rental properties
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
um apartments and whatever that that do
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
not allow human children
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
do not allow human children I am totally
 
04:23:59.809 --> 04:23:59.819 align:start position:0%
unaware of that except
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
for like senior housing there's a grade
 
04:24:02.939 --> 04:24:03.769 align:start position:0%
for like senior housing there's a grade
of

04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
housing for people that are 55 or older
 
04:24:10.250 --> 04:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
or 62 or older I'm not sure of the
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
number but there is authorized elderly
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
housing that can only have people above
 
04:24:18.889 --> 04:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
a certain age
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm confused because I have a friend who
 
04:24:26.689 --> 04:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
lives in Merrimack she used to live in
 
04:24:29.210 --> 04:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
apartments they turned condo and they
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
had to move because they had a child
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
so maybe that maybe it became a senior
 
04:24:34.500 --> 04:24:35.210 align:start position:0%
so maybe that maybe it became a senior
student

04:24:35.210 --> 04:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:24:37.670 --> 04:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
senior housing it could be that it's a
 
04:24:40.250 --> 04:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
senior housing it had been transformed
 
04:24:43.309 --> 04:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
into a senior housing is totally illegal
 
04:24:43.319 --> 04:24:44.750 align:start position:0%
into a senior housing is totally illegal
to

04:24:44.750 --> 04:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
not allow children based on
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination of familial status
 
04:24:53.210 --> 04:24:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.929 --> 04:24:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:59.090 --> 04:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
the only question I had Mr Norman is do
 
04:25:01.250 --> 04:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
you think that we could reform the small
 
04:25:03.650 --> 04:25:03.660 align:start position:0%
claims process to make it easier to
 
04:25:06.290 --> 04:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
collect I would love to be on that
 
04:25:08.990 --> 04:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee if we
 
04:25:12.290 --> 04:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
may take 30 seconds if you want to
 
04:25:14.830 --> 04:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
address affordable housing
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
a huge step
 
04:25:20.990 --> 04:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
in that direction would be to make small
 
04:25:23.210 --> 04:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
claims productive
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
and a simple idea
 
04:25:29.570 --> 04:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
is to offer to Property Owners seeking
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
damages from tenants the same
 
04:25:38.630 --> 04:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
process as someone seeking child support
 
04:25:41.090 --> 04:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
for instance we're pretty good
 
04:25:44.410 --> 04:25:44.420 align:start position:0%
at forcing child support
 
04:25:47.389 --> 04:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
as a society but we're absolutely
 
04:25:50.870 --> 04:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
terrible at having tenants cause damage
 
04:25:54.349 --> 04:25:54.359 align:start position:0%
that is never collected and then it goes
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
passed on to other tenants
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm off the soapbox yeah I
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
should never have asked the question
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
thanks but I'll gladly step on
 
04:26:05.929 --> 04:26:05.939 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions for Mr
 
04:26:07.969 --> 04:26:07.979 align:start position:0%
Norman thank you for your testimony
 
04:26:10.370 --> 04:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
today thank you so much
 
04:26:26.149 --> 04:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:26.159 --> 04:26:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:26:31.250 --> 04:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
I think I'll take off my mask uh
 
04:26:33.050 --> 04:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
my name is Kurt Ehrenberg I'm the state
 
04:26:35.149 --> 04:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
director for the Humane Society of the
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
United States
 
04:26:39.290 --> 04:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
happy to be here today and support
 
04:26:42.110 --> 04:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
of this study committee
 
04:26:42.120 --> 04:26:42.889 align:start position:0%
of this study committee
um

04:26:42.889 --> 04:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
and I do have written testimony I didn't
 
04:26:46.670 --> 04:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
make enough copies
 
04:26:48.710 --> 04:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
but I have one to furnish to the
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee hopefully
 
04:26:52.429 --> 04:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
we'll get one to everyone I can email
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
them I won't read the whole thing just a
 
04:26:56.330 --> 04:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
few paragraphs
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say uh although pet
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
friendly housing has become more common
 
04:27:04.610 --> 04:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
the industry standard for pet friendly
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
still contains limitations and
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
restrictions on types ages and sizes of
 
04:27:11.389 --> 04:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
pets that severely restrict the rental
 
04:27:12.830 --> 04:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
housing market
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
these policies are based on
 
04:27:17.570 --> 04:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
misinformation and myth rather than data
 
04:27:20.030 --> 04:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
and property managers who established
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
such arbitrary restrictions are missing
 
04:27:24.889 --> 04:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
out on large segments of the pet owning
 
04:27:24.899 --> 04:27:27.050 align:start position:0%
out on large segments of the pet owning
population

04:27:27.050 --> 04:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:27:30.469 --> 04:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
nearly 85 million U.S households in an
 
04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
estimated 72 percent of renters have a
 
04:27:34.020 --> 04:27:35.530 align:start position:0%
estimated 72 percent of renters have a
pet

04:27:35.530 --> 04:27:35.540 align:start position:0%
pet
 
04:27:38.149 --> 04:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
now we believe housing issues should
 
04:27:41.090 --> 04:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
never cost pets their homes which is a
 
04:27:44.330 --> 04:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
significant concern for many families
 
04:27:46.610 --> 04:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
each year millions of pets enter animal
 
04:27:46.620 --> 04:27:47.809 align:start position:0%
each year millions of pets enter animal
shelters

04:27:47.809 --> 04:27:47.819 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
and one of the most frequently cited
 
04:27:51.950 --> 04:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
reasons for relinquishment
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
is a housing moving or landlord issue
 
04:27:58.969 --> 04:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
breed size or weight restrictions and
 
04:28:01.969 --> 04:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
the limited amount of rental housing
 
04:28:04.729 --> 04:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
that will allow animals
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
creates many obstacles for renters with
 
04:28:10.250 --> 04:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
pets that lack of accessible housing can
 
04:28:12.649 --> 04:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
have disastrous consequences some
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
families are forced to relinquish their
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
pets to shelters ripping those families
 
04:28:19.849 --> 04:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
apart often with detrimental impacts on
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
their physical and emotional well-being
 
04:28:24.290 --> 04:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
others may choose to hide their pet
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
despite the risk of jeopardizing their
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
housing rather than give up a beloved
 
04:28:29.880 --> 04:28:31.490 align:start position:0%
housing rather than give up a beloved
companion

04:28:31.490 --> 04:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
companion
 
04:28:33.290 --> 04:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll just say there are many
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
benefits for housing providers with
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
policies that welcome pets such as an
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
increase in their pool of potential
 
04:28:42.889 --> 04:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
renters and a decrease in their turnover
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
costs because they gain longer term more
 
04:28:48.649 --> 04:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
stable residents on average pet owners
 
04:28:51.110 --> 04:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
stay in a rental property twice as long
 
04:28:53.630 --> 04:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
as those without pets while only 10
 
04:28:56.090 --> 04:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
percent of pet owners have ever lost a
 
04:28:58.010 --> 04:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
security deposit
 
04:29:00.950 --> 04:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
10 percent of pet owners have ever lost
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
a security deposit and pet owners are
 
04:29:05.809 --> 04:29:05.819 align:start position:0%
not statistically more likely to damage
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
rental units and these are all backed up
 
04:29:10.370 --> 04:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you the citations Property
 
04:29:12.170 --> 04:29:12.180 align:start position:0%
Owners can also take additional
 
04:29:15.290 --> 04:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
precautionary measures when leasing to a
 
04:29:18.649 --> 04:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
pet owning tenant such as requiring a
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable pet deposit for potential
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
damages and proof of vaccinations for
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
the pet
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
not the human both measures are
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
accounted for in this bill so again this
 
04:29:32.689 --> 04:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
is a study
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
bill it has notwithstanding the previous
 
04:29:38.570 --> 04:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
bill that as a representative Reed
 
04:29:41.630 --> 04:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
alluded to was poison pilled
 
04:29:43.670 --> 04:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the last
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
time around so this is a study committee
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
so to have the tenant uh the The
 
04:29:52.429 --> 04:29:52.439 align:start position:0%
Landlord Association say that no good no
 
04:29:53.870 --> 04:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
good can come
 
04:29:57.170 --> 04:29:57.180 align:start position:0%
out of a study committee that affects
 
04:29:59.330 --> 04:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
72 percent of the people that rent
 
04:30:02.210 --> 04:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
housing in this state
 
04:30:02.220 --> 04:30:02.870 align:start position:0%
housing in this state
um

04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:04.490 --> 04:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense to me I
 
04:30:07.070 --> 04:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate your time and I'm happy to
 
04:30:10.070 --> 04:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr Ehrenberg
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative Langley
 
04:30:17.450 --> 04:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Ehrenberg can
 
04:30:19.070 --> 04:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
you tell me do you know in terms of
 
04:30:22.130 --> 04:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
public housing are pets allowed in those
 
04:30:24.889 --> 04:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
facilities or those rental units
 
04:30:26.809 --> 04:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
the Federal
 
04:30:26.819 --> 04:30:28.790 align:start position:0%
the Federal
uh

04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
Federal housing pets are allowed
 
04:30:33.889 --> 04:30:33.899 align:start position:0%
basically is the answer to that yes
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up Mr Speaker yes do
 
04:30:39.889 --> 04:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
you do you have any understanding as to
 
04:30:42.170 --> 04:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
why it's more manageable in public
 
04:30:44.990 --> 04:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
housing as opposed to what one of the
 
04:30:47.090 --> 04:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
previous speakers alluded to in terms of
 
04:30:49.010 --> 04:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
private housing
 
04:30:52.790 --> 04:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
I do I do not thank you
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.769 --> 04:30:57.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:31:07.910 --> 04:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.229 --> 04:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.070 --> 04:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that brings us to our next hearing
 
04:31:27.110 --> 04:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.910 --> 04:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the termination of Elise
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:38.689 --> 04:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:43.550 --> 04:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
I was looking for the uh oh
 
04:31:47.330 --> 04:31:47.340 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant do you have a
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative adjutant you're the prime
 
04:31:59.870 --> 04:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill would you like to
 
04:32:07.610 --> 04:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.010 --> 04:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
all right thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:32:12.290 --> 04:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
members of the House Judiciary Committee
 
04:32:14.149 --> 04:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me today
 
04:32:19.250 --> 04:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 1133 a bill aimed
 
04:32:22.189 --> 04:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
at stopping evictions where the single
 
04:32:24.530 --> 04:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
case for eviction is the property
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
changes hands
 
04:32:28.370 --> 04:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
this bill would require the new landlord
 
04:32:30.290 --> 04:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
who purchases a building with tenants in
 
04:32:33.170 --> 04:32:33.180 align:start position:0%
it honor the leases for the remainder of
 
04:32:34.790 --> 04:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
their original agreement
 
04:32:36.290 --> 04:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
it does not mean the landlord is
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
required to renew it does not mean the
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
renter you know if the renter just stops
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
paying rent that the landlord has to
 
04:32:43.670 --> 04:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
continue to honor the lease it's
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
specifically and only creates a
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
protection where the sale of the
 
04:32:50.330 --> 04:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
building is the only reason a person
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be evicted as you'll
 
04:32:54.889 --> 04:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
hear today this does happen in the state
 
04:32:56.809 --> 04:32:56.819 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I was inspired to
 
04:32:58.910 --> 04:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
submit the bill after a pretty severe
 
04:33:00.769 --> 04:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
acquisition of a building in Concord
 
04:33:02.929 --> 04:33:02.939 align:start position:0%
where unfortunately a bunch of poor and
 
04:33:05.090 --> 04:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
disabled folks found themselves with
 
04:33:07.429 --> 04:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
30-day notices to get out when they
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
thought they had longer and were current
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
on their bills with no other issues and
 
04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't think that was right and so
 
04:33:15.890 --> 04:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
here's the bill
 
04:33:18.590 --> 04:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
why this is necessary especially now in
 
04:33:20.570 --> 04:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
my opinion is because the temperature of
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
the housing market in the state of New
 
04:33:24.769 --> 04:33:24.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire buildings can have dozens of
 
04:33:26.990 --> 04:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
cash offers the day that they're put on
 
04:33:29.449 --> 04:33:29.459 align:start position:0%
the market they can be sold in days and
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden a tenant is who is under
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
the impression that they have seven
 
04:33:35.150 --> 04:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
months in a lease can find out they have
 
04:33:37.310 --> 04:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
30 days to find a new place to live near
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
work near their kids school which
 
04:33:41.631 --> 04:33:41.641 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be as big a deal if we didn't
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
have such an insanely low vacancy rate
 
04:33:46.730 --> 04:33:46.740 align:start position:0%
to boot I really fear that folks put in
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
that situation through no fault of their
 
04:33:51.170 --> 04:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
own again who are current on all of
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
their bills and have no other issues may
 
04:33:55.970 --> 04:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
end up with housing or may end up
 
04:33:58.330 --> 04:33:58.340 align:start position:0%
without housing
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
there there's an argument that I've
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
heard floated around that
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
in most cases uh a court will side on
 
04:34:09.609 --> 04:34:09.619 align:start position:0%
the on behalf of the tenant
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the word most is doing a
 
04:34:13.330 --> 04:34:13.340 align:start position:0%
lot of heavy lifting in that sentence
 
04:34:15.709 --> 04:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
and I just think having something firm
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
in the RSA would be better
 
04:34:21.590 --> 04:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
there is one thing that I would ask the
 
04:34:24.230 --> 04:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee to consider and it is an
 
04:34:26.090 --> 04:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
amendment that I've already discussed
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
with a Committee Member to change the
 
04:34:32.510 --> 04:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
word non-restricted to restricted just
 
04:34:34.369 --> 04:34:34.379 align:start position:0%
so it broadens the scope
 
04:34:37.551 --> 04:34:37.561 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm not as familiar with
 
04:34:39.410 --> 04:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
landlord and tenant law as I would like
 
04:34:42.109 --> 04:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
to be so in trying to craft that bill
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
the distinction between non-restricted
 
04:34:47.090 --> 04:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
and restricted slipped by me but
 
04:34:48.529 --> 04:34:48.539 align:start position:0%
changing that to restricted would
 
04:34:50.929 --> 04:34:50.939 align:start position:0%
broaden the scope I spoke to Mr Elliott
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
Berry and he had wisely made that
 
04:34:53.279 --> 04:34:54.590 align:start position:0%
Berry and he had wisely made that
suggestion

04:34:54.590 --> 04:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
04:34:58.131 --> 04:34:58.141 align:start position:0%
um but that's all I have so I would once
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
again further clarify so that it doesn't
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
accidentally Get Lost in Translation
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
that the sole purpose of this bill is to
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
just say that if your building changes
 
04:35:12.650 --> 04:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
hands and you have seven months left on
 
04:35:14.750 --> 04:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
that lease as long as you're current on
 
04:35:16.490 --> 04:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
everything as long as there's no other
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
reason as long as you don't burn the
 
04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
building down as long as you don't stop
 
04:35:21.650 --> 04:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
paying rent you stay there for the
 
04:35:23.330 --> 04:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
remainder of the lease I think it will
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
help keep a couple more people's lives
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
whole and that's what we're looking for
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
so I can take any questions
 
04:35:30.000 --> 04:35:32.810 align:start position:0%
so I can take any questions
questions

04:35:32.810 --> 04:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:35.209 --> 04:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo
 
04:35:37.970 --> 04:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:35:41.209 --> 04:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
thank you representative adjutant um so
 
04:35:43.849 --> 04:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
I thought that
 
04:35:46.910 --> 04:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to terminate a
 
04:35:49.789 --> 04:35:49.799 align:start position:0%
lease upon the sale of a property type
 
04:35:52.070 --> 04:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
of property
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
uh that was not my understanding
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
um I I can't answer that 100
 
04:36:02.510 --> 04:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I in in the research that I did
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
um there's still an opportunity uh for
 
04:36:08.090 --> 04:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
that lease to be terminated uh after it
 
04:36:10.131 --> 04:36:10.141 align:start position:0%
changes hands I'm not sure that
 
04:36:11.631 --> 04:36:11.641 align:start position:0%
protection exists in New Hampshire I'm
 
04:36:13.369 --> 04:36:13.379 align:start position:0%
open to being wrong
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
um but I I think that having this line
 
04:36:18.109 --> 04:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
in the RSA would be helpful
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
about what
 
04:36:22.369 --> 04:36:22.379 align:start position:0%
um representative you mentioned
 
04:36:25.490 --> 04:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
evictions in conquered what a particular
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
property was sold and you had said that
 
04:36:30.709 --> 04:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
all the tenants received an eviction
 
04:36:30.719 --> 04:36:32.029 align:start position:0%
all the tenants received an eviction
notice

04:36:32.029 --> 04:36:32.039 align:start position:0%
notice
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from the newspaper
 
04:36:37.369 --> 04:36:37.379 align:start position:0%
articles that I read was that the
 
04:36:37.379 --> 04:36:38.330 align:start position:0%
articles that I read was that the
tenants

04:36:38.330 --> 04:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
04:36:41.689 --> 04:36:41.699 align:start position:0%
rent went to Market rent and they were
 
04:36:43.970 --> 04:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
served rent increased notices
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
and then the victims followed after that
 
04:36:49.730 --> 04:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
when the tenants you know could not pay
 
04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
or couldn't afford to pay the market
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
rent is that correct
 
04:36:54.840 --> 04:36:55.609 align:start position:0%
rent is that correct
um

04:36:55.609 --> 04:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:57.650 --> 04:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
04:37:01.490 --> 04:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.769 --> 04:37:03.779 align:start position:0%
it might be my understanding when I read
 
04:37:03.779 --> 04:37:04.970 align:start position:0%
it might be my understanding when I read
that

04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:37:06.890 --> 04:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
um was that
 
04:37:08.209 --> 04:37:08.219 align:start position:0%
um there were folks that were serving
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
those eviction notices
 
04:37:10.320 --> 04:37:11.929 align:start position:0%
those eviction notices
um and

04:37:11.929 --> 04:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:37:16.131 --> 04:37:16.141 align:start position:0%
um even if that specific example
 
04:37:20.209 --> 04:37:20.219 align:start position:0%
um isn't practical uh in this
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
application for every tenant there are
 
04:37:24.410 --> 04:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
still situations in the state of New
 
04:37:27.289 --> 04:37:27.299 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where buy a property Changing
 
04:37:27.299 --> 04:37:28.609 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where buy a property Changing
Hands

04:37:28.609 --> 04:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
Hands
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
um those individuals are eligible for an
 
04:37:34.510 --> 04:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
eviction there's actually another bill
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
that will deal with something similar
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
although I don't feel like it goes far
 
04:37:40.029 --> 04:37:40.039 align:start position:0%
enough so we have this
 
04:37:42.170 --> 04:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
but I just think having this protection
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um thank you Mr
 
04:37:50.449 --> 04:37:50.459 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative I believe
 
04:37:52.490 --> 04:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
so representative Lynn had a bill last
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
year that would allow for determination
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
of a lease upon the sale of property so
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm confused on what the RSA
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
says because I thought we were we voted
 
04:38:05.990 --> 04:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
that out of the committee last year
 
04:38:06.000 --> 04:38:07.730 align:start position:0%
that out of the committee last year
enabling

04:38:07.730 --> 04:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
enabling
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
eviction Upon A termination of lease and
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
now there's another bill coming to us
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
about termination of lease like
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
prohibiting it so I guess I'm wondering
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
where the RSA stands I think
 
04:38:19.010 --> 04:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Delorenzo is also kind of
 
04:38:20.750 --> 04:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
bringing that up because
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
um we were under the impression that
 
04:38:22.439 --> 04:38:23.209 align:start position:0%
um we were under the impression that
it's

04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:38:23.219 --> 04:38:24.650 align:start position:0%
it's
that

04:38:24.650 --> 04:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is not allowed to happen
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware as to whether or not
 
04:38:35.090 --> 04:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
that uh Bill became law last year
 
04:38:35.100 --> 04:38:36.109 align:start position:0%
that uh Bill became law last year
okay

04:38:36.109 --> 04:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
um it was killed in the Senate okay
 
04:38:42.470 --> 04:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I understand
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
um that there may be some confliction on
 
04:38:47.170 --> 04:38:47.180 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm happy to double check there
 
04:38:50.929 --> 04:38:50.939 align:start position:0%
when I read the statute that I was
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking to amend uh it didn't it just it
 
04:38:56.150 --> 04:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
basically said like an eviction can
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
happen and then what I was trying to do
 
04:39:01.310 --> 04:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
was put a comma at the end of that
 
04:39:05.090 --> 04:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
sentence and say provided that the
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
exchange of ownership of a property is
 
04:39:11.929 --> 04:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
not the reason for eviction
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
um so it adds that line in there
 
04:39:17.631 --> 04:39:17.641 align:start position:0%
um as a specific uh you can evict except
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:32.090 --> 04:39:32.100 align:start position:0%
I guess uh the question I'd have
 
04:39:34.609 --> 04:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
representative adjudon is I'm not aware
 
04:39:37.730 --> 04:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
of any circumstances
 
04:39:37.740 --> 04:39:39.410 align:start position:0%
of any circumstances
uh

04:39:39.410 --> 04:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
except where Justice might require
 
04:39:44.630 --> 04:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
in the superior court and these matters
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
are all done in the Circuit Court
 
04:39:49.190 --> 04:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court doesn't have Equity power
 
04:39:52.250 --> 04:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
to invalidate a contract
 
04:39:54.890 --> 04:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of any circumstances where
 
04:39:59.330 --> 04:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
the court has authority to invalidate a
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
legal contract between two private
 
04:40:02.280 --> 04:40:03.410 align:start position:0%
legal contract between two private
parties

04:40:03.410 --> 04:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
parties
 
04:40:07.250 --> 04:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'm very curious to know if
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm not aware of any circumstance
 
04:40:09.600 --> 04:40:12.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm not aware of any circumstance
where

04:40:12.110 --> 04:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:40:15.170 --> 04:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
just based upon the fact that there was
 
04:40:18.410 --> 04:40:18.420 align:start position:0%
a change in the ownership of a property
 
04:40:20.630 --> 04:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
that somebody was evicted
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
are you other than the example you gave
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
a Congress are you aware of any
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
circumstance where that happened I I had
 
04:40:31.730 --> 04:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
a couple people lined up to speak to
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
that today I without looking behind me
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're here or not
 
04:40:39.650 --> 04:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
um but uh you know my my like I said my
 
04:40:42.830 --> 04:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
reading of that RSA was this is allowed
 
04:40:44.570 --> 04:40:44.580 align:start position:0%
to happen trying to put the comma in
 
04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
there and put the last line of uh except
 
04:40:50.690 --> 04:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
for this so that's just what I'm looking
 
04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:40:52.378 --> 04:40:55.788 align:start position:0%
to do
foreign

04:40:55.788 --> 04:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:59.150 --> 04:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:41:06.490 --> 04:41:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:12.708 --> 04:41:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you much again
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman again I have written
 
04:41:17.160 --> 04:41:18.530 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman again I have written
testimony

04:41:18.530 --> 04:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
I I just comment that we do have a
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
number of people who want to speak so if
 
04:41:25.368 --> 04:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
you can make your testimonies quite
 
04:41:25.378 --> 04:41:35.868 align:start position:0%
you can make your testimonies quite
brief

04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.190 --> 04:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
ly so I won't bother with the
 
04:41:38.330 --> 04:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
introduction because we talked about
 
04:41:41.030 --> 04:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
that before and you know me well
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
I've been in real estate since 1987.
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I can unequivocally tell you that a
 
04:41:51.708 --> 04:41:51.718 align:start position:0%
lease is a contract
 
04:41:53.208 --> 04:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
04:41:56.510 --> 04:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
and that a sale of a property does not
 
04:41:59.030 --> 04:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
void the contract of a lease if it's
 
04:42:01.368 --> 04:42:01.378 align:start position:0%
during the term of the lease
 
04:42:04.190 --> 04:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
this common knowledge in real estate is
 
04:42:06.490 --> 04:42:06.500 align:start position:0%
taught in real estate schools
 
04:42:10.490 --> 04:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
on my core team of people that analyze
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
bills for me there's attorneys and I
 
04:42:15.050 --> 04:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
reviewed this with two of the attorneys
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
on the team
 
04:42:17.280 --> 04:42:18.170 align:start position:0%
on the team
um

04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:20.288 --> 04:42:20.298 align:start position:0%
a lease
 
04:42:23.890 --> 04:42:23.900 align:start position:0%
supersedes the sale
 
04:42:23.900 --> 04:42:25.730 align:start position:0%
supersedes the sale
unquestionably

04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
unquestionably
 
04:42:28.670 --> 04:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're correct Delorenzo I think your
 
04:42:32.270 --> 04:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
mic might be off when you speak
 
04:42:32.280 --> 04:42:33.530 align:start position:0%
mic might be off when you speak
um

04:42:33.530 --> 04:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:35.448 --> 04:42:35.458 align:start position:0%
so I mean that that's it bill is
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
unnecessary we already have this
 
04:42:40.250 --> 04:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
protection in the law adding a clause to
 
04:42:42.170 --> 04:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
the law about this just creates
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
confusion in the law because there's
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
other parts of the law that talked about
 
04:42:47.570 --> 04:42:47.580 align:start position:0%
good cause and evictions and so forth
 
04:42:49.250 --> 04:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
so we're we're against the bill because
 
04:42:51.410 --> 04:42:51.420 align:start position:0%
it's unnecessary that is already the law
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
you cannot sell you cannot terminate a
 
04:42:55.368 --> 04:42:55.378 align:start position:0%
lease because of the sale of a property
 
04:42:57.410 --> 04:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
if it's during the term of the lease and
 
04:42:59.448 --> 04:42:59.458 align:start position:0%
the lease hasn't expired
 
04:43:01.850 --> 04:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
there is the possibility that both
 
04:43:03.590 --> 04:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
parties could agree
 
04:43:06.170 --> 04:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
a landlord and a tenant could agree that
 
04:43:07.910 --> 04:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
they have a clause in their lease that
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
allows for the lease to be
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
terminated if the property is sold but
 
04:43:13.670 --> 04:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
that is an agreement between the
 
04:43:15.230 --> 04:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
landlord and the Tenant and that's
 
04:43:17.810 --> 04:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
extremely unusual I've never seen it but
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard that it sometimes happens
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm ready for any questions
 
04:43:29.570 --> 04:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:32.208 --> 04:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative Chase
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have one question thank you
 
04:43:35.330 --> 04:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
so much what about
 
04:43:37.010 --> 04:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
um when you're doing a month-to-month
 
04:43:37.020 --> 04:43:38.810 align:start position:0%
um when you're doing a month-to-month
lease

04:43:38.810 --> 04:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
lease
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
so on a month-to-month lease there's no
 
04:43:41.520 --> 04:43:42.890 align:start position:0%
so on a month-to-month lease there's no
term

04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
term
 
04:43:46.550 --> 04:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
so you can that comes under good cause
 
04:43:49.850 --> 04:43:49.860 align:start position:0%
eviction and this allowed under the RSA
 
04:43:52.270 --> 04:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
to sell the property
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
to terminate the lease for the sale of
 
04:44:00.470 --> 04:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
04:44:05.638 --> 04:44:07.788 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

04:44:07.788 --> 04:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
and representative Reed
 
04:44:14.810 --> 04:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and honorable members
 
04:44:19.128 --> 04:44:19.138 align:start position:0%
I have to full disclosure I had no idea
 
04:44:22.490 --> 04:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
this bill existed I was in here anyway I
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
saw it I read it and I I have my own
 
04:44:27.288 --> 04:44:27.298 align:start position:0%
story to tell on this because there
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
seemed to be questions about whether or
 
04:44:30.770 --> 04:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
not this happens now I cannot speak to
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but just so you know my
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
background I grew up in South Memphis a
 
04:44:37.570 --> 04:44:37.580 align:start position:0%
very impoverished urban area
 
04:44:41.990 --> 04:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
and my family rented a house it was the
 
04:44:45.110 --> 04:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
best place we ever lived and we were
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
quite happy there the elderly owner of
 
04:44:50.090 --> 04:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
that property died and it went to his
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
son his son sold the property and didn't
 
04:44:55.850 --> 04:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
that obviously the the new owners did
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
not own uh honor the lease and my family
 
04:45:01.850 --> 04:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
was out on their ear the only place they
 
04:45:04.250 --> 04:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
could find on such short notice was
 
04:45:06.170 --> 04:45:06.180 align:start position:0%
honestly it was I don't believe it was
 
04:45:08.090 --> 04:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
actually legally allowed to be rented it
 
04:45:11.390 --> 04:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
was a a trailer that didn't have proper
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
heat or running water so
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
um that is the kind of impact that that
 
04:45:19.550 --> 04:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
can have for a family to not be able to
 
04:45:21.890 --> 04:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
plan ahead now again I just wanted to
 
04:45:24.110 --> 04:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
share that background
 
04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um but I cannot speak to specifics and I
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
didn't know this bill was up I don't
 
04:45:29.090 --> 04:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
know what the case is in New Hampshire
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
but if it is something that landlords
 
04:45:33.230 --> 04:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
can do
 
04:45:35.628 --> 04:45:35.638 align:start position:0%
um then I would suggest that you pass
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
04:45:56.628 --> 04:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm going to try to speak
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
up it's my first time testifying in this
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
new pandemic World
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm here representing New Hampshire
 
04:46:05.868 --> 04:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
legal assistance I'm here in place of my
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
colleague Elliot Berry who has not been
 
04:46:09.110 --> 04:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
able to make it today
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
um we at nhla are a non-profit Law Firm
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
we provide free legal services for
 
04:46:16.368 --> 04:46:16.378 align:start position:0%
low-income families and seniors and
 
04:46:18.650 --> 04:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
among the work that we do is eviction
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
defense for attendance so we are sort of
 
04:46:25.730 --> 04:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
familiar with this area of law
 
04:46:29.270 --> 04:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
as the law currently stands there is not
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
anything in the rsas or any Supreme
 
04:46:37.690 --> 04:46:37.700 align:start position:0%
Court case law that states that a a a
 
04:46:40.970 --> 04:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
lease can be terminated because of the
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
sale of the property or that it cannot
 
04:46:44.930 --> 04:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
be it's it's just not written into our
 
04:46:47.448 --> 04:46:47.458 align:start position:0%
law as it is I believe it's a common law
 
04:46:50.208 --> 04:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
principle that the lease runs with the
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
land uh currently it is our experience
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
at nhla over several decades of work
 
04:46:55.680 --> 04:46:57.110 align:start position:0%
at nhla over several decades of work
that

04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:00.410 --> 04:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
um in any case where we have received an
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
eviction notice that our clients have
 
04:47:03.708 --> 04:47:03.718 align:start position:0%
received that they are being evicted
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
because of the sale of the property we
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
have been able to get those cases
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
dismissed because the lease currently
 
04:47:11.570 --> 04:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
runs with the land
 
04:47:15.050 --> 04:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
um as representative adjutant noted
 
04:47:16.970 --> 04:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
though there are definitely instances
 
04:47:19.610 --> 04:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
where someone will receive an eviction
 
04:47:19.620 --> 04:47:20.890 align:start position:0%
where someone will receive an eviction
notice

04:47:20.890 --> 04:47:20.900 align:start position:0%
notice
 
04:47:25.070 --> 04:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
for termination of the lease upon sale
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the land and
 
04:47:30.890 --> 04:47:30.900 align:start position:0%
um if it's not in the RSA neither the
 
04:47:33.170 --> 04:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
the landlord nor the tenant know that
 
04:47:35.090 --> 04:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
this is currently a legal Principle as
 
04:47:37.128 --> 04:47:37.138 align:start position:0%
it exists in New Hampshire although the
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
judges will if it is raised as a defense
 
04:47:43.730 --> 04:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
um so I imagine most of those tenants
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Edgington described
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
would not know that they could file a
 
04:47:51.050 --> 04:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
motion to dismiss the eviction case
 
04:47:53.050 --> 04:47:53.060 align:start position:0%
based on the principle that the lease
 
04:47:55.250 --> 04:47:55.260 align:start position:0%
continues to run with the land after the
 
04:47:55.260 --> 04:47:56.750 align:start position:0%
continues to run with the land after the
sale

04:47:56.750 --> 04:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
sale
 
04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
um and so for that reason I think there
 
04:48:01.730 --> 04:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
is a benefit to including that in the
 
04:48:04.208 --> 04:48:04.218 align:start position:0%
text of our rsas
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
it also May potentially save some
 
04:48:10.128 --> 04:48:10.138 align:start position:0%
landlords a the cost of a filing and
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
service fee in an eviction case where us
 
04:48:15.830 --> 04:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh Troublesome legal aid attorneys come
 
04:48:17.330 --> 04:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
in and end up getting the case dismissed
 
04:48:18.890 --> 04:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
and then they've lost a couple hundred
 
04:48:21.410 --> 04:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
bucks on the filing fees
 
04:48:21.420 --> 04:48:22.430 align:start position:0%
bucks on the filing fees
um

04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
now we we did have a concern about the
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
the bill as written because as it is
 
04:48:31.310 --> 04:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
written it it refers to the transfer of
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
title to a non-restricted property shall
 
04:48:34.910 --> 04:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
not be caused to terminating the
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
tendency for the duration of the current
 
04:48:38.810 --> 04:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
lease term and we are a little concerned
 
04:48:41.990 --> 04:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
that as written that would have sort of
 
04:48:43.670 --> 04:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
a negative implication that in a
 
04:48:45.230 --> 04:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
restricted property
 
04:48:49.010 --> 04:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh the transfer of title can be cause
 
04:48:51.170 --> 04:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
for a termination of the tendency
 
04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and uh that would be concerning to us
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
as the majority of rental units in New
 
04:48:59.330 --> 04:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are restricted property
 
04:49:01.550 --> 04:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
um for to be clear a non-restricted
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
property is generally an owner-occupied
 
04:49:07.490 --> 04:49:07.500 align:start position:0%
apartment building with four more units
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
um a single-family home where the owner
 
04:49:11.090 --> 04:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
of the single family homes owes three or
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
more single-family homes or a property
 
04:49:16.430 --> 04:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
that has been received as a result of a
 
04:49:18.770 --> 04:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
foreclosure or tax deeding anything else
 
04:49:21.708 --> 04:49:21.718 align:start position:0%
which is the majority of rental units is
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
considered a restricted property so that
 
04:49:26.030 --> 04:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
potential negative inference of only
 
04:49:28.150 --> 04:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
this this cause only being covered by
 
04:49:30.650 --> 04:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
non-restricted property is a concern to
 
04:49:36.350 --> 04:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
us uh I I circulated a proposal to amend
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
this that um attorney Elliott Berry
 
04:49:40.750 --> 04:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
drafted up earlier today
 
04:49:46.250 --> 04:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
which would instead add a clause to RSA
 
04:49:48.250 --> 04:49:48.260 align:start position:0%
540 colon 2
 
04:49:52.490 --> 04:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
that states that the
 
04:49:55.550 --> 04:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
that in general the termination of a
 
04:49:58.850 --> 04:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
tendency is not I'm sorry that a
 
04:50:01.010 --> 04:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
transfer of title is not grounds for
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
termination of a tendency and we include
 
04:50:06.530 --> 04:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
it in their uh some language that there
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
is an exception for foreclosure and tax
 
04:50:10.850 --> 04:50:10.860 align:start position:0%
deeding and the reason that that is in
 
04:50:13.970 --> 04:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
there is in a situation of a foreclosure
 
04:50:17.030 --> 04:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
or a tax deeding it is actually the the
 
04:50:19.250 --> 04:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
person receiving the property transfer
 
04:50:23.690 --> 04:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
the in the uh the mortgagee the mortgage
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
or mortgage or uh actually has a
 
04:50:29.930 --> 04:50:29.940 align:start position:0%
superior Grant of of title to the to the
 
04:50:34.250 --> 04:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
property and the their interest in the
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
property actually supersedes the lease
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so in that case uh in the transfer
 
04:50:42.650 --> 04:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
where it is a foreclosure or tax deeding
 
04:50:47.930 --> 04:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
in those instances the the the lease
 
04:50:51.170 --> 04:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
can be terminated by the what is
 
04:50:52.730 --> 04:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
essentially the superior right holder
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
the the mortgager or the the tax Keating
 
04:50:57.830 --> 04:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
and we wanted to include that in there
 
04:51:00.230 --> 04:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
in case this amendment is adopted uh
 
04:51:03.288 --> 04:51:03.298 align:start position:0%
because we thought the our colleagues in
 
04:51:05.090 --> 04:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
the banking industry would be concerned
 
04:51:07.010 --> 04:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
if that was not in there because it
 
04:51:08.510 --> 04:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
would negatively impact their existing
 
04:51:08.520 --> 04:51:11.330 align:start position:0%
would negatively impact their existing
rights

04:51:11.330 --> 04:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:18.770 --> 04:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:51:23.270 --> 04:51:23.280 align:start position:0%

to the State House
 
04:52:19.788 --> 04:52:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'm also speaking in favor of this bill
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Manchester housing
 
04:52:24.350 --> 04:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
Alliance and we are just a coalition of
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester residents who want to secure
 
04:52:29.448 --> 04:52:29.458 align:start position:0%
our safe affordable housing for all of
 
04:52:31.368 --> 04:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
our residents in the city
 
04:52:34.368 --> 04:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
uh so I am test uh testifying on behalf
 
04:52:37.368 --> 04:52:37.378 align:start position:0%
of our members again in support of hb133
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh we are calling this the limiting
 
04:52:40.970 --> 04:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
evictions and stop escalating
 
04:52:44.390 --> 04:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
homelessness act or lease act for short
 
04:52:47.208 --> 04:52:47.218 align:start position:0%
uh over the past year I have joined
 
04:52:49.368 --> 04:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
rights and democracy members in knocking
 
04:52:51.110 --> 04:52:51.120 align:start position:0%
doors in the middle and low-income
 
04:52:52.970 --> 04:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods particularly around
 
04:52:52.980 --> 04:52:54.350 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods particularly around
Manchester

04:52:54.350 --> 04:52:54.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
04:52:56.570 --> 04:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
we frequently hear stories about tenants
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
who after living in their apartment for
 
04:53:01.010 --> 04:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
years or decades find that their
 
04:53:02.930 --> 04:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
landlord has sold the property to a new
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
owner often out of state
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's standard to evict current tenants
 
04:53:10.250 --> 04:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
to renovate the units and rent them out
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
at a higher rate pricing our most
 
04:53:14.090 --> 04:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
vulnerable residents out of their
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhood we tend to call this
 
04:53:15.840 --> 04:53:17.390 align:start position:0%
neighborhood we tend to call this
renovation

04:53:17.390 --> 04:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
04:53:19.970 --> 04:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
there's a high demand and low housing
 
04:53:22.850 --> 04:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
stock so an eviction notice is at best
 
04:53:22.860 --> 04:53:24.170 align:start position:0%
stock so an eviction notice is at best
stressful

04:53:24.170 --> 04:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
stressful
 
04:53:26.930 --> 04:53:26.940 align:start position:0%
one eviction or bad credit score could
 
04:53:28.868 --> 04:53:28.878 align:start position:0%
put a tenant at risk for homelessness
 
04:53:31.310 --> 04:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
burdening or already full shelters here
 
04:53:34.150 --> 04:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
in the city of Manchester
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
hb133 would simply let tenants finish
 
04:53:38.750 --> 04:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
out leases they signed with their
 
04:53:40.850 --> 04:53:40.860 align:start position:0%
landlords and enable them to plan
 
04:53:43.610 --> 04:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
accordingly without undue stress and
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
inadequate time to transition
 
04:53:47.990 --> 04:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
staying the remainder of Elise could be
 
04:53:50.030 --> 04:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
the difference between a kid finishing
 
04:53:51.890 --> 04:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
grade school with their friends and
 
04:53:54.170 --> 04:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
potentially having to move out of state
 
04:53:55.788 --> 04:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
it means that people can take more
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
control over their lives by reducing the
 
04:54:00.230 --> 04:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
stress of having to suddenly find an
 
04:54:02.930 --> 04:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
apartment in a tight market and this is
 
04:54:04.070 --> 04:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
why I recommend that this committee
 
04:54:06.350 --> 04:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
votes yes on this bill so thank you very
 
04:54:06.360 --> 04:54:08.628 align:start position:0%
votes yes on this bill so thank you very
much

04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:17.628 --> 04:54:17.638 align:start position:0%
I guess the basic question Mr Lemay is
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
are you aware of circumstances where
 
04:54:21.730 --> 04:54:21.740 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
in in a lease Arrangement have been
 
04:54:29.628 --> 04:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
evicted by the courts yeah unfortunately
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to bring one of those people
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
here today but they couldn't get out of
 
04:54:34.730 --> 04:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
their shift
 
04:54:36.410 --> 04:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
um yeah so like I said we call it
 
04:54:36.420 --> 04:54:37.510 align:start position:0%
um yeah so like I said we call it
renovation

04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
04:54:40.550 --> 04:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty common especially
 
04:54:41.990 --> 04:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
because we have such a hot housing
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
market here so a lot of people are
 
04:54:46.490 --> 04:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
buying up properties and then hoping to
 
04:54:48.770 --> 04:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
rent them out at a more expensive rent
 
04:54:50.330 --> 04:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
every month
 
04:54:53.270 --> 04:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
did I answer your question or
 
04:54:55.730 --> 04:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes you did okay thank you
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
find it contrary to law but I do yeah I
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
just think this would make things a lot
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
more clear and it would it would just
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
make things a lot easier and less
 
04:55:10.368 --> 04:55:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.150 --> 04:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
could I ask you a question in terms of a
 
04:55:22.128 --> 04:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the chairs question
 
04:55:25.368 --> 04:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
do the notices that the tenants receive
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually say they're being evicted
 
04:55:30.288 --> 04:55:30.298 align:start position:0%
because the property has changed hands
 
04:55:33.410 --> 04:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
or does it happen more subtly and people
 
04:55:36.050 --> 04:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
receive perhaps an increase in their
 
04:55:38.990 --> 04:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
rent and aren't able to make that and as
 
04:55:40.670 --> 04:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
a result feel they're being evicted
 
04:55:43.730 --> 04:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
under those circumstances
 
04:55:47.230 --> 04:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
I would say the most common type is a
 
04:55:49.690 --> 04:55:49.700 align:start position:0%
constructural eviction
 
04:55:51.770 --> 04:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
so basically
 
04:55:53.570 --> 04:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
um they wouldn't usually buy the
 
04:55:55.970 --> 04:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
property they want to renovate it so
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
then that's how they usually end up
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
doing it it's always usually followed up
 
04:56:00.650 --> 04:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
by a rent increase too
 
04:56:03.170 --> 04:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay so that's usually in tandem thank
 
04:56:03.180 --> 04:56:03.350 align:start position:0%
okay so that's usually in tandem thank
you

04:56:03.350 --> 04:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:56:03.360 --> 04:56:06.050 align:start position:0%
you

04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr May thank you
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
for hearing me
 
04:56:15.050 --> 04:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
again is there anyone else who would
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:22.610 --> 04:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
seeing no one we will close the hearing
 
04:56:25.368 --> 04:56:25.378 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1133
 
04:56:28.730 --> 04:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
and we will briefly recess until two
 
04:56:30.890 --> 04:56:30.900 align:start position:0%
o'clock and we will then begin our
 
04:57:31.910 --> 04:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.920 --> 04:59:11.628 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:59:11.628 --> 04:59:11.638 align:start position:0%

04:59:46.020 --> 04:59:48.530 align:start position:0%
 
please

04:59:48.530 --> 04:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.690 --> 04:59:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.700 --> 05:00:10.368 align:start position:0%
 
ICS

05:00:10.368 --> 05:00:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.448 --> 05:00:35.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:35.458 --> 05:00:49.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:00:49.250 --> 05:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.288 --> 05:00:57.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:57.298 --> 05:01:08.510 align:start position:0%
 
you know

05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.910 --> 05:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:30.230 --> 05:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.610 --> 05:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
05:02:34.368 --> 05:02:34.378 align:start position:0%
sir your um your mic isn't on
 
05:02:38.690 --> 05:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me the
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide some information
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
on the amendment I'm proposing
 
05:02:49.010 --> 05:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
as we all know the housing appeals board
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
has been a has been a hot potato debate
 
05:02:55.970 --> 05:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
for a while and one of my goals with it
 
05:02:58.070 --> 05:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
with this was to bridge the gap one of
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
the main goals is to bridge the gap on
 
05:03:03.650 --> 05:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
maybe some of the the critiques that I
 
05:03:05.690 --> 05:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
hear about the potential makeup of the
 
05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and some of the
 
05:03:09.890 --> 05:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
potential conflict of interest to build
 
05:03:11.708 --> 05:03:11.718 align:start position:0%
that in so we can
 
05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
bring both sides maybe closer together
 
05:03:17.150 --> 05:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
on the the benefits or the the pluses of
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:22.970 --> 05:03:22.980 align:start position:0%
I propose has changed because although
 
05:03:25.850 --> 05:03:25.860 align:start position:0%
RSA 679 addresses have processes
 
05:03:25.860 --> 05:03:27.050 align:start position:0%
RSA 679 addresses have processes
thoroughly

05:03:27.050 --> 05:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
thoroughly
 
05:03:29.090 --> 05:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
I think that their continued room for
 
05:03:30.530 --> 05:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
some additional conflict of interest
 
05:03:32.690 --> 05:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
language and protections and also
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
clarifying some of the procedures during
 
05:03:36.708 --> 05:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
temporary board vacancies
 
05:03:40.310 --> 05:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
I did propose an amendment when I had
 
05:03:42.650 --> 05:03:42.660 align:start position:0%
originally submitted this LSR in October
 
05:03:44.930 --> 05:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
I had some original language in there
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then after some long discussions I
 
05:03:50.230 --> 05:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
spent quite a bit of time speaking to
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Lin
 
05:03:54.830 --> 05:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
former Supreme Court Justice and he and
 
05:03:56.810 --> 05:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
I talked about this at length and I
 
05:03:58.550 --> 05:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
decided to tweak that language a little
 
05:04:00.170 --> 05:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
bit so that's what that amendment is
 
05:04:02.510 --> 05:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
about I gave you all a copy and I'll
 
05:04:03.890 --> 05:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
obviously send it to you electronically
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
as well one of the things that I also
 
05:04:08.690 --> 05:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
handed out to you is uh the sheet it
 
05:04:10.850 --> 05:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
says explanation for HP 1254 and
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I like visual aids
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
they help me so I just thought maybe
 
05:04:16.670 --> 05:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
you'd be easy for us to follow along
 
05:04:18.230 --> 05:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
together that way
 
05:04:20.330 --> 05:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
so in that you can see the bolded
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
language is the places where I'm
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
tweaking the language or the bolded
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
text is the places where I'm tweaking
 
05:04:29.330 --> 05:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
the language to 679. there's two
 
05:04:31.190 --> 05:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
sections where I'm tweaking this
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
language 679 one
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
and 679 colon 8.
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the first section the reasons for the
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
changes the first reason for the change
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
in 679 colon 1 is to increase the
 
05:04:46.368 --> 05:04:46.378 align:start position:0%
ability of the hab
 
05:04:48.170 --> 05:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
to have a board member with Municipal
 
05:04:50.330 --> 05:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
planning expertise versus just citing
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
that they have Housing Development
 
05:04:51.600 --> 05:04:53.350 align:start position:0%
that they have Housing Development
expertise

05:04:53.350 --> 05:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
expertise
 
05:04:55.850 --> 05:04:55.860 align:start position:0%
codifying this diverse language and the
 
05:04:57.708 --> 05:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
diverse capability to the have makeup
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
will increase the balance decision
 
05:04:59.520 --> 05:05:00.490 align:start position:0%
will increase the balance decision
making

05:05:00.490 --> 05:05:00.500 align:start position:0%
making
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
and it also actually address some of the
 
05:05:06.288 --> 05:05:06.298 align:start position:0%
criticism I've heard is that
 
05:05:08.448 --> 05:05:08.458 align:start position:0%
that there isn't maybe some
 
05:05:10.970 --> 05:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
representation for the municipals on
 
05:05:13.128 --> 05:05:13.138 align:start position:0%
that on that board although this won't
 
05:05:14.810 --> 05:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
allow for a municipal to be on that
 
05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
board per se perhaps somebody with some
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
Municipal planning expertise also could
 
05:05:21.650 --> 05:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
be add in as well at the discretion of
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's on there as
 
05:05:27.410 --> 05:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
well again a slight tweak to the
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
language of a professional land surveyor
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
license in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
the reason for that obviously is to
 
05:05:34.250 --> 05:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
acknowledge and codify the professional
 
05:05:36.650 --> 05:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
requirements of land surveyors the board
 
05:05:38.570 --> 05:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
of land surveyors exist just for this
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
reason to regulate in licensing land
 
05:05:42.530 --> 05:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
surveyors so I thought it would be
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate since we stated in there
 
05:05:47.510 --> 05:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that a lawyer
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
licensed practice in New Hampshire and
 
05:05:51.948 --> 05:05:51.958 align:start position:0%
we also codify that for land surveyors
 
05:05:53.030 --> 05:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:05:55.070 --> 05:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
the last part that you'll see in there
 
05:05:57.948 --> 05:05:57.958 align:start position:0%
is the conflict of interest language at
 
05:06:00.350 --> 05:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom and that was built in
 
05:06:02.510 --> 05:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
to just to provide some additional
 
05:06:05.570 --> 05:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
protections for people if they feel like
 
05:06:07.490 --> 05:06:07.500 align:start position:0%
what if the what if the board has a
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest what if what if
 
05:06:10.310 --> 05:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're making decisions that are
 
05:06:12.170 --> 05:06:12.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to benefit them personally
 
05:06:14.090 --> 05:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
that I know that that's actually been
 
05:06:16.190 --> 05:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
quite of a concern that I've heard that
 
05:06:17.390 --> 05:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
people are concerned that some of the
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
decisions are going to be made Might
 
05:06:21.410 --> 05:06:21.420 align:start position:0%
financially benefit somebody who might
 
05:06:23.150 --> 05:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
be on that board
 
05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
so this adds it in this actually came
 
05:06:29.570 --> 05:06:29.580 align:start position:0%
right from RSA 21g colon 22 which
 
05:06:31.970 --> 05:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
actually deals with a code of ethics
 
05:06:34.910 --> 05:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to the executive branch but
 
05:06:38.390 --> 05:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's useful language here as well
 
05:06:42.410 --> 05:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
as far as section 679 colon 8 goes when
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
you get to Temporary board members
 
05:06:47.570 --> 05:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
the one thing that I have on here is
 
05:06:49.788 --> 05:06:49.798 align:start position:0%
that I have that the Supreme Court
 
05:06:52.190 --> 05:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
not the board will be in charge of
 
05:06:54.650 --> 05:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
appointing temporary members
 
05:06:57.590 --> 05:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
I felt that this was important and this
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
was something I actually discussed with
 
05:07:01.070 --> 05:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
with boblin as well representative Lynn
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
and he he thought that that was a that
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
that was an appropriate change as well
 
05:07:08.330 --> 05:07:08.340 align:start position:0%
again I'm trying to bridge the gap
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
between some of the criticism I hear
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
about the hab that maybe a decision
 
05:07:14.930 --> 05:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
could be made somebody could be brought
 
05:07:16.610 --> 05:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
in at the last minute on a temporary
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
basis that would make a decision that
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
was more favorable to one project or
 
05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
another but by having the Supreme Court
 
05:07:24.410 --> 05:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
actually be involved in that process
 
05:07:26.868 --> 05:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
directly and not the board members that
 
05:07:30.050 --> 05:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
that nullifies that that debate
 
05:07:32.510 --> 05:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
and then the last change that I have on
 
05:07:35.510 --> 05:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
there as well is that in the infant of a
 
05:07:38.090 --> 05:07:38.100 align:start position:0%
vacancy on the board before in the
 
05:07:40.190 --> 05:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
language it says if the appellant agrees
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they could proceed with the case
 
05:07:44.570 --> 05:07:44.580 align:start position:0%
but the reason I built this language in
 
05:07:46.010 --> 05:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
because the appellant shouldn't be the
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
only person there's other two parties in
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
that case maybe multiple maybe three but
 
05:07:52.310 --> 05:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
the appellant shouldn't be the only
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
person who gets to decide if a case gets
 
05:07:56.650 --> 05:07:56.660 align:start position:0%
to proceed during a temporary board
 
05:07:59.030 --> 05:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
situation a temporary board member or
 
05:08:01.250 --> 05:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
vacancy on the board so all this does is
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
this builds in language that says if
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's a vacancy on the board everybody
 
05:08:07.490 --> 05:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
gets to to have a say in that
 
05:08:09.530 --> 05:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
so those are the
 
05:08:11.690 --> 05:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
the gist of the changes I have I'm happy
 
05:08:15.410 --> 05:08:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
I have a basic question we have sort of
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
three related bills
 
05:08:30.230 --> 05:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh there's this bill which would
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
make changes to the board as it exists
 
05:08:34.910 --> 05:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
there's a bill submitted by
 
05:08:36.170 --> 05:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd I think just to
 
05:08:38.930 --> 05:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
repeal the board and then there is a
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
third bill from representative Lynn who
 
05:08:45.110 --> 05:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
which would create a separate Docket in
 
05:08:47.570 --> 05:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court which if in fact we
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
adopted that there would be some
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not the
 
05:08:53.930 --> 05:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
housing board would be needed so do
 
05:08:57.230 --> 05:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
do you believe that this approach is the
 
05:08:59.890 --> 05:08:59.900 align:start position:0%
preferential approach or do you support
 
05:09:02.810 --> 05:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
one of the other approaches
 
05:09:05.330 --> 05:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
well with regard to representative Lin's
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
Bill uh I don't really fully know the
 
05:09:10.970 --> 05:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
details on how that would play out I
 
05:09:12.350 --> 05:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
would like to see that a little bit more
 
05:09:15.708 --> 05:09:15.718 align:start position:0%
I would support either or whether we
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
move towards representative Lynn's
 
05:09:20.930 --> 05:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
approach or whether we have the hab and
 
05:09:23.390 --> 05:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
we try to create some of the language in
 
05:09:25.010 --> 05:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
there that
 
05:09:27.590 --> 05:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
that nullifies the concerns that people
 
05:09:29.810 --> 05:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
have and make them feel more comfortable
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
that the hab is going to be fair
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
so whichever way that goes all I want is
 
05:09:38.930 --> 05:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
for it to be fair and for people to have
 
05:09:41.570 --> 05:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
confidence in that and for the have if
 
05:09:43.128 --> 05:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the have then we're
 
05:09:44.330 --> 05:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that it doesn't have
 
05:09:47.160 --> 05:09:49.788 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that it doesn't have
um

05:09:49.788 --> 05:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.530 --> 05:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know how exactly to put this but
 
05:09:53.270 --> 05:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a false impression of
 
05:09:55.430 --> 05:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
being a boogeyman
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
it just is what it is and it's allowed
 
05:10:01.490 --> 05:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
to function well without undue criticism
 
05:10:04.190 --> 05:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't um
 
05:10:06.530 --> 05:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's just allowed to function I mean I I
 
05:10:08.570 --> 05:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying is that one of the
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
things one of the things I thought was
 
05:10:10.320 --> 05:10:11.270 align:start position:0%
things one of the things I thought was
really

05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:10:13.610 --> 05:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
um just in all disclosure I actually had
 
05:10:16.368 --> 05:10:16.378 align:start position:0%
this bill was a lot bigger it was a lot
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
deeper there was a lot of cuts I just
 
05:10:21.288 --> 05:10:21.298 align:start position:0%
went for it and then I actually did a
 
05:10:23.090 --> 05:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
lot of homework on it and I talked to a
 
05:10:25.430 --> 05:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
lot of people and in that process I
 
05:10:26.990 --> 05:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
realized why it was written the way it
 
05:10:29.810 --> 05:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
was why the language was what it was why
 
05:10:31.610 --> 05:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
the fact that the appointment of board
 
05:10:33.830 --> 05:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
members is different than 99 percent of
 
05:10:36.170 --> 05:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
other board members I I found all those
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
answers out and at the end of the day I
 
05:10:41.810 --> 05:10:41.820 align:start position:0%
couldn't see that making deeper cuts to
 
05:10:43.310 --> 05:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
that was something that I was
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with because it was already
 
05:10:47.570 --> 05:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
crafted in a way that had a lot of
 
05:10:49.730 --> 05:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
thought to it but it still did have room
 
05:10:51.650 --> 05:10:51.660 align:start position:0%
to increase some conflict of language
 
05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
interest to give people some more
 
05:10:57.110 --> 05:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
reassurances that this will be a fair
 
05:10:57.120 --> 05:11:00.170 align:start position:0%
reassurances that this will be a fair
body

05:11:00.170 --> 05:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.170 --> 05:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Alexander
 
05:11:05.150 --> 05:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you Mr chair thank
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:11:06.480 --> 05:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
you representative
um

05:11:07.430 --> 05:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:10.250 --> 05:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
so the housing appeals board was passed
 
05:11:12.590 --> 05:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
recently signed into law through the
 
05:11:15.050 --> 05:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
state budget last year and since then
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's been like less than 15 decisions
 
05:11:19.670 --> 05:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
rendered from the board do you feel like
 
05:11:21.890 --> 05:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
this bill to try to fix something that
 
05:11:23.930 --> 05:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
is really in the infant stages is even
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
needed because we we have we don't
 
05:11:27.530 --> 05:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
really have a holistic idea of what the
 
05:11:30.470 --> 05:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
board has done yet do you think we
 
05:11:33.110 --> 05:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
should wait and kind of see maybe a lot
 
05:11:35.208 --> 05:11:35.218 align:start position:0%
of the concerns around the board could
 
05:11:37.250 --> 05:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
be alleviated with time that's a good
 
05:11:39.230 --> 05:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you and and I will say
 
05:11:41.510 --> 05:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
when my originally when I was originally
 
05:11:44.470 --> 05:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
taking taking this RSA and
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
writing all over it that would have been
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
a that would have been a legitimate
 
05:11:50.330 --> 05:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern that maybe hey wait
 
05:11:52.730 --> 05:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
and see how it happens but regardless of
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether they've had those 15 cases or 50
 
05:11:57.650 --> 05:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
more the language that's put in there
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually I believe makes sense because
 
05:12:02.390 --> 05:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
of the fact that it's not it's not
 
05:12:04.010 --> 05:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
changing anything they do
 
05:12:05.930 --> 05:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
it's not changing their decisions it's
 
05:12:07.490 --> 05:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
merely just putting in a little bit of
 
05:12:10.610 --> 05:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
protection for conflict of interest in a
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of assurance for people that
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
during situations of temporary board
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
members or vacancies that it will remain
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
consistently Fair during that process
 
05:12:23.090 --> 05:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that that's anything
 
05:12:25.670 --> 05:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
whether it's 15 or going into the future
 
05:12:27.530 --> 05:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
that doesn't change I don't see this as
 
05:12:34.010 --> 05:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:36.830 --> 05:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
05:12:36.840 --> 05:12:39.288 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Simpson

05:12:39.288 --> 05:12:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:41.090 --> 05:12:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:12:43.670 --> 05:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
05:12:45.530 --> 05:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
um you have mentioned something about
 
05:12:49.128 --> 05:12:49.138 align:start position:0%
how the board is not functioning well or
 
05:12:50.810 --> 05:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
something like that or how do we let it
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
function I just wondered I'm not as
 
05:12:56.930 --> 05:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
familiar about about how um what how
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
people perceive it's functioning and I
 
05:13:00.110 --> 05:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
wondered if you could talk a little more
 
05:13:02.448 --> 05:13:02.458 align:start position:0%
about that sure I wasn't referring that
 
05:13:03.948 --> 05:13:03.958 align:start position:0%
the board wasn't functioning well oh
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
okay what I was saying is that of the
 
05:13:08.930 --> 05:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
camp of we want the hab to the camp of
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
we don't want the hab
 
05:13:14.090 --> 05:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
some of the things that I hear are and
 
05:13:15.170 --> 05:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
some of the things that people bring to
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
me in my in my town as well and then
 
05:13:19.550 --> 05:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
also in the legislature the some of the
 
05:13:20.628 --> 05:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
state reps
 
05:13:23.390 --> 05:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
there is a concern that the hab quite
 
05:13:24.830 --> 05:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
frankly could go in and just overturn
 
05:13:26.750 --> 05:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
all these Municipal decisions there's
 
05:13:29.810 --> 05:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
concerns that it it could be uh
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
the boogeyman that it in in some Theory
 
05:13:34.490 --> 05:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
because it's just going to go over and
 
05:13:37.010 --> 05:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
and take out local control and I I
 
05:13:39.590 --> 05:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
understand those concerns and we've only
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
had 15 cases so I'm not addressing what
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
they do but I am what I am trying to do
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
is build in some reassurance to people
 
05:13:49.250 --> 05:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
that are over in the camp here of having
 
05:13:50.990 --> 05:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
those concerns of what if could happen
 
05:13:52.490 --> 05:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
What could happen if this happens what
 
05:13:54.050 --> 05:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
if they have a temporary board member
 
05:13:56.690 --> 05:13:56.700 align:start position:0%
and somebody uh brings somebody on that
 
05:13:58.850 --> 05:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
they know they'll vote a certain way I'm
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
trying to actually just make that fair
 
05:14:02.930 --> 05:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
so that that actually doesn't happen in
 
05:14:04.730 --> 05:14:04.740 align:start position:0%
some ways these are protections for the
 
05:14:07.368 --> 05:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
hab so that they can function without
 
05:14:10.190 --> 05:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
unneeded criticism that's how I see this
 
05:14:11.930 --> 05:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
does that make sense does that answer
 
05:14:14.090 --> 05:14:14.100 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:14:17.090 --> 05:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes that does thank you very much
 
05:14:19.128 --> 05:14:19.138 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you just
 
05:14:21.770 --> 05:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up it seems like this
 
05:14:23.510 --> 05:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill and amendment is trying to kind of
 
05:14:25.868 --> 05:14:25.878 align:start position:0%
address concerns about
 
05:14:28.730 --> 05:14:28.740 align:start position:0%
qualifications for board members on the
 
05:14:30.830 --> 05:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
hab but I guess what I'm wondering is if
 
05:14:32.810 --> 05:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this on the level of
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
the hab should we then
 
05:14:37.128 --> 05:14:37.138 align:start position:0%
um propose to you know require mandatory
 
05:14:39.050 --> 05:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
training on zoning and planning board
 
05:14:41.150 --> 05:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
procedures for our local boards you know
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
what's the difference why are we
 
05:14:44.750 --> 05:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
requiring it here and not somewhere else
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
so the only thing that I changed
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
as far as qualifications on the board
 
05:14:52.430 --> 05:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
there was no changes other than adding
 
05:14:54.110 --> 05:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
in Municipal planning saying that
 
05:14:55.510 --> 05:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
somebody could have
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
experience in Housing Development and
 
05:15:00.110 --> 05:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal planning that's the only thing
 
05:15:02.390 --> 05:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
so I really don't know I'm not really
 
05:15:05.570 --> 05:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
understanding your question I'm so sorry
 
05:15:08.030 --> 05:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
I guess the question is is that
 
05:15:09.530 --> 05:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
um there were
 
05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
um things proposed about more
 
05:15:13.730 --> 05:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
requirements for becoming a local
 
05:15:16.010 --> 05:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
planning or Zoning Board member or maybe
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
more educational opportunities and you
 
05:15:20.390 --> 05:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
know this amendment is addressing
 
05:15:22.070 --> 05:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities or
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for members on the housing
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
appeals board I was wondering if you
 
05:15:28.368 --> 05:15:28.378 align:start position:0%
think that you know local Planning and
 
05:15:29.810 --> 05:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board officials should have
 
05:15:31.788 --> 05:15:31.798 align:start position:0%
access or have certain you know
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
requirements or
 
05:15:36.350 --> 05:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications needed to serve on their
 
05:15:38.448 --> 05:15:38.458 align:start position:0%
board that might be a potential
 
05:15:40.910 --> 05:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
conversation at another time but for
 
05:15:43.010 --> 05:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
this regard all I'm speaking on today is
 
05:15:45.890 --> 05:15:45.900 align:start position:0%
is really this amendment to RSA 679
 
05:15:49.128 --> 05:15:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:51.410 --> 05:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:15:53.458 --> 05:15:56.390 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
I note that we do have several people to
 
05:16:02.330 --> 05:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
testify and we have a relatively
 
05:16:05.090 --> 05:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
short window to do that but so if you
 
05:16:07.730 --> 05:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
could be succinct that would be that
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
would be great I will call next upon
 
05:16:13.368 --> 05:16:13.378 align:start position:0%
representative Chase who I understand is
 
05:16:19.030 --> 05:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.730 --> 05:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and yes I
 
05:16:24.708 --> 05:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
am speaking on behalf of the senator who
 
05:16:27.770 --> 05:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
was unable to be here due to a conflict
 
05:16:29.570 --> 05:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
in scheduling
 
05:16:31.970 --> 05:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
uh that what she would like to say is
 
05:16:35.270 --> 05:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
that she is in support of these bills in
 
05:16:37.190 --> 05:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
the housing appeal board is an
 
05:16:39.010 --> 05:16:39.020 align:start position:0%
alternative for reviewing of housing
 
05:16:42.530 --> 05:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
related cases the board is specifically
 
05:16:44.208 --> 05:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
designed to provide administrative
 
05:16:47.090 --> 05:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
efficiencies subject matter expertise
 
05:16:48.850 --> 05:16:48.860 align:start position:0%
and adjective
 
05:16:51.170 --> 05:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
education so are you saying that wrong
 
05:16:55.250 --> 05:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
after a local reviews are exhausted this
 
05:16:57.770 --> 05:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
is similar to a board of tax and land
 
05:16:57.780 --> 05:16:59.030 align:start position:0%
is similar to a board of tax and land
Appeals

05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
Appeals
 
05:17:01.970 --> 05:17:01.980 align:start position:0%
the house appeal board is designed to
 
05:17:03.890 --> 05:17:03.900 align:start position:0%
make sure that all of our systems are
 
05:17:06.830 --> 05:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
working efficiently as possible is New
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns and cities try to
 
05:17:10.368 --> 05:17:10.378 align:start position:0%
respond to Market demands for more
 
05:17:13.690 --> 05:17:13.700 align:start position:0%
housing a court review
 
05:17:16.670 --> 05:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
process can be time consuming and
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
expensive and it can even result in
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
projects not being built after it's
 
05:17:23.628 --> 05:17:23.638 align:start position:0%
completed with the local zoning process
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
we want to ensure that affordable
 
05:17:29.090 --> 05:17:29.100 align:start position:0%
housing developers do not and in the
 
05:17:31.788 --> 05:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
case of certain developers we know they
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
cannot pass the cost of the litigation
 
05:17:37.310 --> 05:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
on to the consumers there is a need for
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise in the review
 
05:17:42.410 --> 05:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
process for housing related appeals
 
05:17:45.530 --> 05:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
which the housing appeal board provides
 
05:17:47.510 --> 05:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
there are many myths about the housing
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
appeal boards that I feel should be
 
05:17:51.350 --> 05:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
corrected the housing appeal board
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
cannot rewrite local Municipal zoning
 
05:17:57.230 --> 05:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
ordinance modify local Municipal
 
05:17:59.510 --> 05:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations
 
05:18:02.690 --> 05:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
reverse its site plan regulations change
 
05:18:06.350 --> 05:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
local municipal or Master plans or
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
change rules and regulations from
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or historic
 
05:18:13.490 --> 05:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
district commissions the housing appeal
 
05:18:16.490 --> 05:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
board uses the same standards for care
 
05:18:19.010 --> 05:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
for case I'm sorry case review as the
 
05:18:20.448 --> 05:18:20.458 align:start position:0%
Superior Court
 
05:18:23.030 --> 05:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
board seats are not politically
 
05:18:25.310 --> 05:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
appointed housing appeal board members
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
are appointed by the New Hampshire
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the housing appeal board
 
05:18:32.570 --> 05:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
is a tool in the toolbox arming us with
 
05:18:36.288 --> 05:18:36.298 align:start position:0%
high quality technical expertise in lieu
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
of litigation process I support the
 
05:18:42.830 --> 05:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeal board and as such opposed
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm so sorry I said support in the
 
05:18:47.750 --> 05:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
beginning I'm so sorry that she opposes
 
05:18:49.430 --> 05:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
both the HB
 
05:18:55.010 --> 05:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
15 1254 and HB 12 16. please feel free
 
05:18:57.650 --> 05:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
to reach out if I can be of any further
 
05:18:59.750 --> 05:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
assistance thank you very much Senator
 
05:19:02.170 --> 05:19:02.180 align:start position:0%
Rebecca Perkins
 
05:19:07.128 --> 05:19:07.138 align:start position:0%
Cola Senate District 21. thank you and I
 
05:19:09.550 --> 05:19:09.560 align:start position:0%
will take no questions
 
05:19:15.230 --> 05:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:15.240 --> 05:19:15.850 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:19:15.850 --> 05:19:15.860 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:19:17.930 --> 05:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
let's turn into the whole Judiciary
 
05:19:19.970 --> 05:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
Community just to you
 
05:19:21.650 --> 05:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
it was
 
05:19:24.830 --> 05:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
I think it it says that it went to the
 
05:19:26.448 --> 05:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
chair but I will make sure that it does
 
05:19:28.730 --> 05:19:28.740 align:start position:0%
I think I remember getting one from her
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
but then she's my Senator so maybe she
 
05:19:46.128 --> 05:19:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:47.628 --> 05:19:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:19:49.070 --> 05:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Bob Guida
 
05:19:51.050 --> 05:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
Senate District Two
 
05:19:53.570 --> 05:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
and Prime sponsor of the bill that was
 
05:19:56.030 --> 05:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
the origin of the housing appeals board
 
05:19:58.190 --> 05:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
I want to step back and provide a little
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
bit of background on why this came to be
 
05:20:04.190 --> 05:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
um we have a a critical housing shortage
 
05:20:05.810 --> 05:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
05:20:08.090 --> 05:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
and when I stopped back and look at what
 
05:20:11.090 --> 05:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
was happening it became apparent
 
05:20:13.990 --> 05:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that frankly local planning boards
 
05:20:16.788 --> 05:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
were effectuating policy of their own
 
05:20:18.350 --> 05:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
that was not consistent with State
 
05:20:21.128 --> 05:20:21.138 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing laws okay
 
05:20:24.770 --> 05:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
and so I it took us a couple of years to
 
05:20:26.930 --> 05:20:26.940 align:start position:0%
get this bill through and to establish
 
05:20:28.150 --> 05:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
the board
 
05:20:31.610 --> 05:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
speaking to this particular bill of
 
05:20:35.270 --> 05:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
Representative formula I'm concerned I
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
support the bill I didn't have a copy of
 
05:20:39.430 --> 05:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
the latest iteration
 
05:20:43.128 --> 05:20:43.138 align:start position:0%
uh I'm concerned with the municipal
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
planning piece
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that the municipal
 
05:20:48.650 --> 05:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
planners already had
 
05:20:50.810 --> 05:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
the entire process up to and through the
 
05:20:53.810 --> 05:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
exhaustion of every Appeals mechanism at
 
05:20:55.850 --> 05:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
the local level in which to make their
 
05:20:55.860 --> 05:20:56.810 align:start position:0%
the local level in which to make their
case

05:20:56.810 --> 05:20:56.820 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
and that to appeal to a municipal
 
05:21:02.050 --> 05:21:02.060 align:start position:0%
planner or okay potentially on the board
 
05:21:04.208 --> 05:21:04.218 align:start position:0%
would be potentially
 
05:21:07.070 --> 05:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
prejudicing that board in its
 
05:21:09.770 --> 05:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
decision-making process okay
 
05:21:12.590 --> 05:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
so that part of the bill I would I would
 
05:21:14.628 --> 05:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
ask you to carefully consider the rest
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
of it I don't have a problem with I
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
think if we can establish you know
 
05:21:20.810 --> 05:21:20.820 align:start position:0%
cleaner guidelines that's fine
 
05:21:20.820 --> 05:21:21.770 align:start position:0%
cleaner guidelines that's fine
um

05:21:21.770 --> 05:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:25.250 --> 05:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that's fine
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
um but that one concerning piece there's
 
05:21:28.798 --> 05:21:29.930 align:start position:0%
um but that one concerning piece there's
also

05:21:29.930 --> 05:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:21:29.940 --> 05:21:30.770 align:start position:0%
also
um

05:21:30.770 --> 05:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:34.430 --> 05:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
on line 12 of amendment
 
05:21:36.530 --> 05:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
0067 which I believe is representative
 
05:21:38.270 --> 05:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
homologous condensation of the first
 
05:21:40.850 --> 05:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
part of the of her original bill
 
05:21:40.860 --> 05:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
part of the of her original bill
uh

05:21:42.470 --> 05:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:44.570 --> 05:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
indirect what indirectly effect means
 
05:21:50.448 --> 05:21:50.458 align:start position:0%
all right so that might require us a
 
05:21:52.670 --> 05:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
little bit more definition definition
 
05:21:54.650 --> 05:21:54.660 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm indirectly affected by
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
something Joe Biden does
 
05:21:59.448 --> 05:21:59.458 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'm directly into and so that
 
05:22:01.550 --> 05:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
to me is concerning yes we want clean
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't want it so clean that
 
05:22:06.288 --> 05:22:06.298 align:start position:0%
anything that's possible to happen would
 
05:22:08.090 --> 05:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
result in a possible disqualification of

05:22:14.510 --> 05:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
some some look again I I asked the
 
05:22:15.830 --> 05:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee to look at that and with that
 
05:22:18.110 --> 05:22:18.120 align:start position:0%

Ben Frost
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:44.690 --> 05:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
and Mr chairman I will endeavor to stick
 
05:22:45.708 --> 05:22:45.718 align:start position:0%
to that
 
05:22:47.990 --> 05:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'll Endeavor to
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
hold you to it good afternoon I'm Ben
 
05:22:52.490 --> 05:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
Frost from New Hampshire housing I have
 
05:22:54.530 --> 05:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
a letter that I'll distribute but
 
05:22:56.270 --> 05:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
recognizing that there is an amendment
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
that you have and that I've not seen
 
05:22:59.990 --> 05:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
that uh that there are portions of the
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
letter that are no longer germane but
 
05:23:05.570 --> 05:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
I'll stick to what um what has been
 
05:23:07.070 --> 05:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
spoken to earlier with regard to the
 
05:23:09.650 --> 05:23:09.660 align:start position:0%
amendment I'll try to anyway
 
05:23:12.890 --> 05:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
um our position is of opposition to the
 
05:23:14.750 --> 05:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced and I recognize what
 
05:23:16.430 --> 05:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida said and what the
 
05:23:18.350 --> 05:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative homeless has said about
 
05:23:20.868 --> 05:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment
 
05:23:22.250 --> 05:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I think there are a couple issues
 
05:23:24.530 --> 05:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
that remain El Echo Senator guide us
 
05:23:27.590 --> 05:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
concerns about Municipal planning but I
 
05:23:29.448 --> 05:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
have not seen the language yet so I
 
05:23:31.010 --> 05:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
can't really comment on the specifics of
 
05:23:31.020 --> 05:23:32.270 align:start position:0%
can't really comment on the specifics of
it

05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:23:32.280 --> 05:23:32.990 align:start position:0%
it
um

05:23:32.990 --> 05:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:36.610 --> 05:23:36.620 align:start position:0%
I believe that the conflict of interest
 
05:23:40.070 --> 05:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
issue is already addressed in RSA
 
05:23:43.570 --> 05:23:43.580 align:start position:0%
chapter 679 and if you look at
 
05:23:46.970 --> 05:23:46.980 align:start position:0%
lines seven through nine of the the bill
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
is introduced you see the existing
 
05:23:50.930 --> 05:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
language that deals with conflicts and
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
this was carefully drawn recognizing
 
05:23:56.150 --> 05:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
that no member should be serving on the
 
05:23:57.708 --> 05:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board on a case on the
 
05:23:59.330 --> 05:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board where they have a
 
05:24:00.830 --> 05:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest it's the sort of
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts that we deal with
 
05:24:04.610 --> 05:24:04.620 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level with board
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
members and that judges deal with in any
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
case they have before them no no board
 
05:24:11.570 --> 05:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
members should be hearing a case in
 
05:24:12.650 --> 05:24:12.660 align:start position:0%
which they have a conflict I think
 
05:24:13.550 --> 05:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's clear
 
05:24:15.490 --> 05:24:15.500 align:start position:0%
with regard to the member qualifications
 
05:24:18.948 --> 05:24:18.958 align:start position:0%
I can tell you just a little bit of the
 
05:24:21.590 --> 05:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
very very deep history of this
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
um the the term
 
05:24:27.770 --> 05:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
um where the the statute says refers to
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney member license to practice
 
05:24:31.310 --> 05:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:24:34.070 --> 05:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
that was actually the in the second
 
05:24:36.590 --> 05:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
draft or the first draft of the original
 
05:24:38.690 --> 05:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
legislation long before the legislature
 
05:24:41.410 --> 05:24:41.420 align:start position:0%
got it and it was in the second draft
 
05:24:46.368 --> 05:24:46.378 align:start position:0%
that the the other potential member
 
05:24:48.110 --> 05:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
qualifications were introduced so
 
05:24:49.868 --> 05:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
professional engineer which is a
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
recognized term of Law and land surveyor
 
05:24:56.208 --> 05:24:56.218 align:start position:0%
so it said it can be either a
 
05:24:59.868 --> 05:24:59.878 align:start position:0%
professional engineer or land surveyor
 
05:25:02.570 --> 05:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
um recognize though that professional
 
05:25:05.208 --> 05:25:05.218 align:start position:0%
engineer is already a term of law so you
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to say professional land
 
05:25:10.128 --> 05:25:10.138 align:start position:0%
surveyor because for a land surveyor to
 
05:25:12.650 --> 05:25:12.660 align:start position:0%
be claiming to be a land surveyor in New
 
05:25:14.690 --> 05:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they have to be a professional
 
05:25:16.550 --> 05:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
lands Affair it's redundant I don't
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
think that's that's necessary it's not a
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
big deal it's it's harmless but I think
 
05:25:21.240 --> 05:25:23.690 align:start position:0%
big deal it's it's harmless but I think
unnecessary

05:25:23.690 --> 05:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
um with regard to
 
05:25:26.040 --> 05:25:28.788 align:start position:0%
um with regard to
um

05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.730 --> 05:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
the temporary member appointments this
 
05:25:34.368 --> 05:25:34.378 align:start position:0%
language was taken directly out of the
 
05:25:36.410 --> 05:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
btla statute the board of tax on land
 
05:25:38.208 --> 05:25:38.218 align:start position:0%
appeals and that statute's been in
 
05:25:42.170 --> 05:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
existence since 1973 and this the entire
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh structure of the housing appeals
 
05:25:46.010 --> 05:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
board statute
 
05:25:49.190 --> 05:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
was uh significantly built upon the
 
05:25:51.610 --> 05:25:51.620 align:start position:0%
existing language that we have in RSA
 
05:25:55.730 --> 05:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
71b which is the btla statute so the
 
05:25:57.830 --> 05:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
temporary member appointment language
 
05:26:00.050 --> 05:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
that you see in the existing statute for
 
05:26:02.750 --> 05:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board is what has
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
existed since 1973 for the btla
 
05:26:09.230 --> 05:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that that the change is
 
05:26:11.230 --> 05:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
necessary although I recognize
 
05:26:14.090 --> 05:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's expertise in court
 
05:26:16.550 --> 05:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
matters I think we all recognize that
 
05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
but I think that if we're going to
 
05:26:20.090 --> 05:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
change one we should probably be
 
05:26:22.670 --> 05:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
changing the other statute as well
 
05:26:24.830 --> 05:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
I'll pass out the letter just recognize
 
05:26:27.530 --> 05:26:27.540 align:start position:0%
that it part ports of it parts of it are
 
05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
no longer relevant um as long as you
 
05:26:32.390 --> 05:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
take up the amendment I'd be happy to
 
05:26:34.610 --> 05:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:26:38.628 --> 05:26:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:40.910 --> 05:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.230 --> 05:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:58.970 --> 05:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for allowing me to
 
05:27:02.810 --> 05:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
provide testimony my name is Chris
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
Norwood I am a realtor in the state of
 
05:27:08.628 --> 05:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the 2022 chair of the
 
05:27:10.850 --> 05:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Realtors
 
05:27:13.730 --> 05:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
public policy committee I speak today to
 
05:27:16.070 --> 05:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
urge you to in expedient to legislate
 
05:27:18.770 --> 05:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
this bill the housing appeals board is
 
05:27:20.390 --> 05:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
something and we'll talk further about
 
05:27:22.550 --> 05:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
this in the next bill that we feel is
 
05:27:24.170 --> 05:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
very valuable to the state of New
 
05:27:24.180 --> 05:27:24.910 align:start position:0%
very valuable to the state of New
Hampshire

05:27:24.910 --> 05:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:27:29.570 --> 05:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
specifically to HB 1254 we have not seen
 
05:27:32.030 --> 05:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment I just would offer up some
 
05:27:33.850 --> 05:27:33.860 align:start position:0%
high-level thoughts
 
05:27:36.708 --> 05:27:36.718 align:start position:0%
relative to the uh the planning board
 
05:27:39.350 --> 05:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
member I share some of Senator Guida's
 
05:27:41.690 --> 05:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
concerns that was echoed I Believe by
 
05:27:44.810 --> 05:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost and the piece I would just say
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the vacancy part of the
 
05:27:50.930 --> 05:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
value in our opinion to the housing
 
05:27:53.690 --> 05:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
appeals board not only for
 
05:27:53.700 --> 05:27:54.288 align:start position:0%
appeals board not only for
um

05:27:54.288 --> 05:27:54.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:58.550 --> 05:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
a a potential land owner but also to the
 
05:28:02.090 --> 05:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities is the speed in which uh
 
05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
decisions are renders uh and that that
 
05:28:06.410 --> 05:28:06.420 align:start position:0%
includes actually having the hearings
 
05:28:09.288 --> 05:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
and so forth so I would just hope that
 
05:28:11.830 --> 05:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
the um the amended language
 
05:28:15.288 --> 05:28:15.298 align:start position:0%
provides with uh provides a balance
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
between that expediency and some of the
 
05:28:20.570 --> 05:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
concerns that the sponsor has of the
 
05:28:22.910 --> 05:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill relative to some challenges perhaps
 
05:28:25.610 --> 05:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
in the appointment process again just
 
05:28:27.050 --> 05:28:27.060 align:start position:0%
the speed of the housing appeals board
 
05:28:31.190 --> 05:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
does alleviate costs not only for
 
05:28:31.200 --> 05:28:31.970 align:start position:0%
does alleviate costs not only for
um

05:28:31.970 --> 05:28:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
the the developer but municipalities
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
there's legal costs charged every single
 
05:28:39.708 --> 05:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know time that these appeals go
 
05:28:41.690 --> 05:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
on and on so thank you for your
 
05:28:43.550 --> 05:28:43.560 align:start position:0%

05:29:20.930 --> 05:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
Coalition of 80 organizations and

05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we are opposed to House
 
05:29:31.810 --> 05:29:31.820 align:start position:0%
Bill 1254. I'm sharing with you a letter
 
05:29:34.670 --> 05:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
similar to others we had not had a
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
chance to review the amendment so a lot
 
05:29:39.310 --> 05:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
of uh what is referenced in there
 
05:29:42.350 --> 05:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
is no longer germane but our position
 
05:29:45.948 --> 05:29:45.958 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same and as I had a chance
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
to briefly look at this before
 
05:29:50.750 --> 05:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
testifying I can mention a couple of
 
05:29:52.610 --> 05:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
things um one I want to start with just
 
05:29:56.448 --> 05:29:56.458 align:start position:0%
saying by that I think we really share
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the the bill sponsors desire to
 
05:29:59.520 --> 05:30:00.890 align:start position:0%
um the the bill sponsors desire to
educate

05:30:00.890 --> 05:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
educate
 
05:30:05.090 --> 05:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the legislature about the um the need
 
05:30:07.368 --> 05:30:07.378 align:start position:0%
for the housing appeals board and to
 
05:30:10.550 --> 05:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
bring some kind of closure to what had
 
05:30:13.610 --> 05:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
been a divisive debate
 
05:30:16.190 --> 05:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and I see this opportunity today and
 
05:30:17.570 --> 05:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
these hearings
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
um to really address some of these
 
05:30:19.440 --> 05:30:20.628 align:start position:0%
um to really address some of these
concerns

05:30:20.628 --> 05:30:20.638 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
clarify the origins of the board as we
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
as we heard from Senator gaida and
 
05:30:26.690 --> 05:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
really debunked some of the myths that
 
05:30:29.510 --> 05:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
have been circulating I do want to share
 
05:30:30.948 --> 05:30:30.958 align:start position:0%
with you that housing action New
 
05:30:33.410 --> 05:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is mostly known for its
 
05:30:36.530 --> 05:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
affordable housing Focus was just one of
 
05:30:38.690 --> 05:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
a larger group of stakeholders and and
 
05:30:40.250 --> 05:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
you've uh you know you've heard from
 
05:30:42.070 --> 05:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
some of them today
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally proposed back in
 
05:30:45.298 --> 05:30:46.090 align:start position:0%
the bill was originally proposed back in
2018

05:30:46.090 --> 05:30:46.100 align:start position:0%
2018
 
05:30:49.550 --> 05:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
discussions had started in 2017 and
 
05:30:51.650 --> 05:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 557
 
05:30:55.788 --> 05:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
it was followed by Senate Bill 306 and
 
05:30:59.810 --> 05:30:59.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill 104 in 2019 and then the
 
05:31:01.368 --> 05:31:01.378 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board was established
 
05:31:06.170 --> 05:31:06.180 align:start position:0%
when RSA 679 took effect in July 2020
 
05:31:08.510 --> 05:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
. I mentioned the history only because I
 
05:31:10.070 --> 05:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
think one of the myths is that the house
 
05:31:13.070 --> 05:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
did not have a chance to address the
 
05:31:15.530 --> 05:31:15.540 align:start position:0%
need for the board and it did several
 
05:31:15.540 --> 05:31:16.788 align:start position:0%
need for the board and it did several
times

05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:31:20.448 --> 05:31:20.458 align:start position:0%
one in-house Bill 104 and again when the
 
05:31:23.570 --> 05:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
budget came back to the house during
 
05:31:25.010 --> 05:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
that debate
 
05:31:28.430 --> 05:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
in terms you know obviously we we share
 
05:31:31.490 --> 05:31:31.500 align:start position:0%
the concern and and
 
05:31:33.890 --> 05:31:33.900 align:start position:0%
um and underscore the need for strong
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest policy
 
05:31:42.170 --> 05:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
we think that RSA 697 or 679 rather
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
already does that
 
05:31:47.208 --> 05:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
um and as Ben Frost has noted this
 
05:31:48.830 --> 05:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest policy is pulled
 
05:31:50.690 --> 05:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
directly from other conflicts of
 
05:31:52.850 --> 05:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
interest policies particularly the one
 
05:31:54.530 --> 05:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
that governs the Bureau of tax and land
 
05:31:58.128 --> 05:31:58.138 align:start position:0%
appeals and many of uh issues like venue
 
05:31:59.930 --> 05:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
chains and procedures came from that
 
05:32:01.490 --> 05:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
board which has been operating
 
05:32:03.590 --> 05:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
successfully in our state since the mid
 
05:32:03.600 --> 05:32:05.390 align:start position:0%
successfully in our state since the mid
70s

05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
70s
 
05:32:07.850 --> 05:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
overall I would say as you consider what
 
05:32:10.490 --> 05:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
to do uh with with this particular bill
 
05:32:13.788 --> 05:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
I would say to consider that we really
 
05:32:16.070 --> 05:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't need to make these tweaks at this
 
05:32:19.250 --> 05:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
time this issue was deliberated over
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
three years we have a successful model
 
05:32:24.948 --> 05:32:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's just starting as was noted by
 
05:32:27.770 --> 05:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander earlier and we
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
think it would be more prudent for the
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
legislature to wait three to five years
 
05:32:34.010 --> 05:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
then perhaps request a report and
 
05:32:36.230 --> 05:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
convene a study committee and then look
 
05:32:39.708 --> 05:32:39.718 align:start position:0%
at what tweaks you think are appropriate
 
05:32:44.030 --> 05:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:49.190 --> 05:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:51.650 --> 05:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
see none thank you
 
05:32:53.628 --> 05:32:53.638 align:start position:0%
and is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:32:59.690 --> 05:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.570 --> 05:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no one will close the hearing on
 
05:33:05.810 --> 05:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1254.
 
05:33:08.448 --> 05:33:08.458 align:start position:0%
and move on
 
05:33:10.910 --> 05:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
to our next hearing that's on House Bill
 
05:33:10.920 --> 05:33:21.350 align:start position:0%
to our next hearing that's on House Bill
1216.

05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:24.050 --> 05:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
this is repealing the housing appeals
 
05:33:24.060 --> 05:33:31.430 align:start position:0%
this is repealing the housing appeals
board

05:33:31.430 --> 05:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
the primary sponsor is
 
05:33:37.850 --> 05:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd is representative
 
05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
Boyd here
 
05:33:43.368 --> 05:33:43.378 align:start position:0%
thank you and there I have to say we
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
have about uh
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
10 people who have signed up to speak
 
05:33:49.970 --> 05:33:49.980 align:start position:0%
actually more than that at this point in
 
05:33:52.128 --> 05:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
time so if you could make your testimony
 
05:33:59.330 --> 05:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.430 --> 05:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
you can get the you could just testify
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:08.270 --> 05:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
my apologies Mr chairman
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:34:13.010 --> 05:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
through through you to the to my
 
05:34:14.448 --> 05:34:14.458 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues of the court general
 
05:34:17.390 --> 05:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
court my name is Bill Boyd representing
 
05:34:19.730 --> 05:34:19.740 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough 21 in Merrimack
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in support of House
 
05:34:26.810 --> 05:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
Bill 1216 to repeal the housing appeals
 
05:34:26.820 --> 05:34:29.628 align:start position:0%
Bill 1216 to repeal the housing appeals
board

05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:32.570 --> 05:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
as a former local Town official having
 
05:34:34.970 --> 05:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
sat on the Town Council on the plain
 
05:34:36.530 --> 05:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
board in my own community of Merrimack
 
05:34:40.610 --> 05:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
for a combination of close to 20 years I
 
05:34:42.590 --> 05:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
take a lot of pride in what what we've
 
05:34:44.330 --> 05:34:44.340 align:start position:0%
done at the local level in terms of our
 
05:34:47.330 --> 05:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
our ability to appropriately manage land
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
use gross growth in our community
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
I certainly am sympathetic
 
05:34:55.310 --> 05:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
in understanding that some other
 
05:34:58.850 --> 05:34:58.860 align:start position:0%
communities may not have the a balanced
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
approach in developing land use policies
 
05:35:04.310 --> 05:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
that would benefit the people that live
 
05:35:05.990 --> 05:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
in their communities and the developers
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
that choose to build in those
 
05:35:07.920 --> 05:35:09.770 align:start position:0%
that choose to build in those
communities

05:35:09.770 --> 05:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:35:12.890 --> 05:35:12.900 align:start position:0%
they seek to repeal the housing appeals
 
05:35:15.650 --> 05:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
board because historically
 
05:35:18.470 --> 05:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bill was presented as a writer in
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the house budget it was never vetted at
 
05:35:25.010 --> 05:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
the legislative legislative level and as
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
a as a you know having served my
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
community locally now you know I take
 
05:35:32.150 --> 05:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
the will of the voters very seriously as
 
05:35:34.730 --> 05:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you do and I feel that
 
05:35:34.740 --> 05:35:35.990 align:start position:0%
I'm sure all of you do and I feel that
the

05:35:35.990 --> 05:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
desire to enact the housing appeals
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
board undermine the will of the voters
 
05:35:43.250 --> 05:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in terms of how they
 
05:35:45.770 --> 05:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
want to self-determine how they want to
 
05:35:47.390 --> 05:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
grow and choose to grow their
 
05:35:47.400 --> 05:35:48.708 align:start position:0%
grow and choose to grow their
communities

05:35:48.708 --> 05:35:48.718 align:start position:0%
communities
 
05:35:51.170 --> 05:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
now I unders I do recognize the fact
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the Superior Courts are overwhelmed
 
05:35:56.570 --> 05:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
with cases and I and I do I do respect
 
05:35:59.810 --> 05:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
that and I certainly understand having
 
05:36:01.610 --> 05:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
and knowing the developers that have
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
presented in the town of Merrimack that
 
05:36:06.530 --> 05:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
time is money and the longer that you're
 
05:36:08.690 --> 05:36:08.700 align:start position:0%
waiting to get a decision on a case is
 
05:36:10.970 --> 05:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
more money that they're losing out of
 
05:36:12.830 --> 05:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
their pockets in terms of the ability to
 
05:36:14.890 --> 05:36:14.900 align:start position:0%
a bill the project and be
 
05:36:17.270 --> 05:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
recoup a profit
 
05:36:17.280 --> 05:36:18.350 align:start position:0%
recoup a profit
um

05:36:18.350 --> 05:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:20.330 --> 05:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
in the process of wanting to create a
 
05:36:22.490 --> 05:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
level of nimbleness you've added a layer
 
05:36:25.550 --> 05:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
of bureaucracy to the process that
 
05:36:28.368 --> 05:36:28.378 align:start position:0%
potentially could add more time to a
 
05:36:31.128 --> 05:36:31.138 align:start position:0%
land to a land use issue
 
05:36:34.250 --> 05:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
the suggestion if I'm choosing to repeal
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
I need to bring you an alternative and
 
05:36:38.810 --> 05:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
the alternative is to consider creating
 
05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
a dedicated land court with one single
 
05:36:44.390 --> 05:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
Justice dedicated to and deal with land
 
05:36:48.190 --> 05:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
use issues petitions to quiet title
 
05:36:51.250 --> 05:36:51.260 align:start position:0%
property disputes between two people
 
05:36:53.750 --> 05:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
landlord-tenant issues it would present
 
05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
a unique opportunity to create the level
 
05:36:59.868 --> 05:36:59.878 align:start position:0%
of Gravitas at the at that particular
 
05:37:01.970 --> 05:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
level which the state of New Hampshire
 
05:37:05.030 --> 05:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
has always relied upon the Superior
 
05:37:07.788 --> 05:37:07.798 align:start position:0%
Court to be the final say on on land use
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
issues it would give a financial excuse
 
05:37:12.530 --> 05:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
me not Financial excuse me it would give
 
05:37:13.970 --> 05:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
a final
 
05:37:17.810 --> 05:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
decision to the to to the respondents in
 
05:37:20.628 --> 05:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
the case of how a decision is going to
 
05:37:22.610 --> 05:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
come about regarding
 
05:37:25.250 --> 05:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
a particular an issue that appears as it
 
05:37:27.470 --> 05:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
relates to land use so that would be my
 
05:37:29.690 --> 05:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
suggestion is to repeal the housing
 
05:37:33.288 --> 05:37:33.298 align:start position:0%
appeals board and consider enacting and
 
05:37:36.050 --> 05:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
creating a land use Court dedicated to
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
those specific topics
 
05:37:40.250 --> 05:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
I have no written testimony I'd be happy
 
05:37:42.590 --> 05:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
05:37:48.288 --> 05:37:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.970 --> 05:37:49.980 align:start position:0%

the housing appeals board
 
05:38:19.788 --> 05:38:19.798 align:start position:0%

preceding speaker
 
05:38:26.030 --> 05:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to this bill not having had
 
05:38:28.128 --> 05:38:28.138 align:start position:0%
a vetting in the House and Senate let me
 
05:38:28.138 --> 05:38:29.868 align:start position:0%
a vetting in the House and Senate let me
reiterate

05:38:29.868 --> 05:38:29.878 align:start position:0%

05:38:32.030 --> 05:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
the succession of legislative events
 
05:38:33.830 --> 05:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
that took place
 
05:38:36.770 --> 05:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
Senate passed Senate Bill 557
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%

myself Senator Rosenwald Senator Carson
 
05:39:02.330 --> 05:39:02.340 align:start position:0%

the Senate version of the housing

31st of 2019 with a Voice vote
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%

call vote of 18 to 5. clearly strongly
supported

05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
supported
 
05:39:53.750 --> 05:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
Senator dalessandro then chair of the
 
05:39:54.890 --> 05:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
finance committee and the Senate
 
05:39:56.628 --> 05:39:56.638 align:start position:0%
requested at be tabled and addressed
 
05:39:59.090 --> 05:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
within the budget I oppose that of
 
05:40:01.910 --> 05:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
course I was not in the majority and so
 
05:40:03.830 --> 05:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
there was put into the at the trailer
 
05:40:03.840 --> 05:40:05.090 align:start position:0%
there was put into the at the trailer
bill

05:40:05.090 --> 05:40:05.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
it was discussed by conferees during the
 
05:40:10.010 --> 05:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
committee's a conference for the 2021
 
05:40:12.288 --> 05:40:12.298 align:start position:0%
budget they agreed to the request that
 
05:40:13.730 --> 05:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
the appropriation for the housing
 
05:40:16.490 --> 05:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
appeals board moved to fiscal 21 and its
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 415 thousand dollars
 
05:40:20.448 --> 05:40:20.458 align:start position:0%
included in the final Vision a final
 
05:40:22.670 --> 05:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
version of House Bill 4 because House
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 had been vetoed by the governor
 
05:40:26.510 --> 05:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that sort of lays out that
 
05:40:27.948 --> 05:40:27.958 align:start position:0%
this was not hidden in the cover of
 
05:40:29.330 --> 05:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
Darkness this thing has been heard both
 
05:40:31.190 --> 05:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
in the house and in the Senate and in
 
05:40:32.570 --> 05:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
fact in the house recommended for
 
05:40:36.350 --> 05:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:38.090 --> 05:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
the reason is
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
this board was was put together was
 
05:40:42.650 --> 05:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
because we had towns around the state
 
05:40:44.510 --> 05:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to my preceding
 
05:40:47.770 --> 05:40:47.780 align:start position:0%
speaker okay in which planning boards
 
05:40:51.230 --> 05:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
weaponized the legal system
 
05:40:53.570 --> 05:40:53.580 align:start position:0%
and by pleadings and motions and
 
05:40:56.030 --> 05:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
hearings in an already overloaded Court
 
05:40:59.270 --> 05:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay cause delays which then would
 
05:41:01.550 --> 05:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
result in investors
 
05:41:03.350 --> 05:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
stating I don't want to spend my money
 
05:41:06.590 --> 05:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
on litigation I want an investment or I
 
05:41:07.850 --> 05:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to wait another two years
 
05:41:10.190 --> 05:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
until this is decided and would withdraw
 
05:41:12.590 --> 05:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
their support thereby killing support
 
05:41:14.990 --> 05:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
for Workforce housing projects in the
 
05:41:17.150 --> 05:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
state this is not low-income housing
 
05:41:19.010 --> 05:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
this is Workforce housing clearly
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
defined in statute
 
05:41:24.890 --> 05:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
and there by exacerbating the problem of
 
05:41:26.270 --> 05:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
the housing shortage we are still
 
05:41:29.690 --> 05:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
experiencing at a crisis level today
 
05:41:32.030 --> 05:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
so the bill passed
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
and uh I am always a believer that look
 
05:41:36.530 --> 05:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
to data for your answer as to the
 
05:41:37.730 --> 05:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not this board
 
05:41:40.010 --> 05:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
should continue
 
05:41:42.770 --> 05:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
so I sent I had my assistant send to
 
05:41:45.230 --> 05:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
each of you or perhaps to your secretary
 
05:41:46.850 --> 05:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
and ends to each of you last night the
 
05:41:48.170 --> 05:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
link to the housing appeals Board
 
05:41:50.810 --> 05:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
website and the link to the cases and
 
05:41:53.030 --> 05:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
the decisions right and when you read
 
05:41:54.708 --> 05:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
these decisions you'll find that in the
 
05:41:58.368 --> 05:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
15 that are rendered 13 found in favor
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the developer
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
two actually found in favor of the
 
05:42:06.288 --> 05:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
communities planning process
 
05:42:10.250 --> 05:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
and those decisions three major issues
 
05:42:13.730 --> 05:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
were revealed first planning boards were
 
05:42:15.708 --> 05:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
violating the workforce housing statutes
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
for the state not optional state law
 
05:42:21.230 --> 05:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
second they were violating their own
 
05:42:21.240 --> 05:42:22.910 align:start position:0%
second they were violating their own
ordinances

05:42:22.910 --> 05:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:42:25.128 --> 05:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
in making arbitrary decisions based on
 
05:42:26.868 --> 05:42:26.878 align:start position:0%
heaven knows what
 
05:42:29.628 --> 05:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
and third they were making it up as they
 
05:42:31.850 --> 05:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
were going along without any statutory
 
05:42:33.650 --> 05:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
or ordinance to support the decisions
 
05:42:36.590 --> 05:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
they were making relative to Developers
 
05:42:36.600 --> 05:42:37.910 align:start position:0%
they were making relative to Developers
okay

05:42:37.910 --> 05:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:42:41.570 --> 05:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
that is this housing appeals board does
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
not challenge local control
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
it enforces it
 
05:42:50.150 --> 05:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
nobody in a legislative position and
 
05:42:51.948 --> 05:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
this state is above the law and that
 
05:42:53.390 --> 05:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
includes planning boards and zoning
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
boards of adjustment
 
05:42:56.930 --> 05:42:56.940 align:start position:0%
the planning boards were hot against
 
05:42:59.090 --> 05:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill they hate it
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is the results
 
05:43:03.530 --> 05:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
each to which each of you have access to
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
read and I invite you to do so clearly
 
05:43:07.788 --> 05:43:07.798 align:start position:0%
show a pattern
 
05:43:09.650 --> 05:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
where this board is doing its job
 
05:43:11.690 --> 05:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
helping solve the problem within the
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
context of the existing laws
 
05:43:17.030 --> 05:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and helping helping to cure the problem
 
05:43:19.788 --> 05:43:19.798 align:start position:0%
of Workforce housing that is really a
 
05:43:26.930 --> 05:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:30.170 --> 05:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to itl this bill
 
05:43:31.788 --> 05:43:31.798 align:start position:0%
it was modeled after the board of tax
 
05:43:33.410 --> 05:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
and land appeals which functions very
 
05:43:33.420 --> 05:43:34.250 align:start position:0%

the results of its work
 
05:43:41.270 --> 05:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I would invite you to discuss with
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%

05:43:46.788 --> 05:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
how they see their functions
 
05:43:50.330 --> 05:43:50.340 align:start position:0%

05:44:10.010 --> 05:44:10.020 align:start position:0%

ER

05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:45.530 --> 05:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
you need to turn on your microphone just
 
05:44:47.330 --> 05:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
like that yep
 
05:44:49.070 --> 05:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
yep my name is Daniel pray from Amherst
 
05:44:51.350 --> 05:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I serve as and I'm
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
probably going to be in the minority
 
05:44:54.830 --> 05:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
here I serve as a zoning Board member in
 
05:44:57.708 --> 05:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
my town I am also a selectman
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
I also have a law degree and I've been
 
05:45:01.788 --> 05:45:01.798 align:start position:0%
attending my planning board meetings for
 
05:45:03.230 --> 05:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
the past two and a half years so I have
 
05:45:06.770 --> 05:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
a very broad knowledge of how the hab
 
05:45:08.750 --> 05:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
like many other like several other
 
05:45:11.330 --> 05:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
communities we had an appeal before the
 
05:45:11.340 --> 05:45:13.368 align:start position:0%
communities we had an appeal before the
hab

05:45:13.368 --> 05:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
hab
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I just want to tell you the results
 
05:45:17.208 --> 05:45:17.218 align:start position:0%
of that because we are probably the
 
05:45:19.548 --> 05:45:19.558 align:start position:0%
first to my knowledge who are trying to
 
05:45:21.170 --> 05:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
appeal that to the Supreme Court which
 
05:45:22.788 --> 05:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
is another issue
 
05:45:26.628 --> 05:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
I want to take exception to ours is not
 
05:45:28.970 --> 05:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
a Workforce housing appeal by the way
 
05:45:30.770 --> 05:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to put that out there I think
 
05:45:33.650 --> 05:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker is intimating that
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
these are all Workforce housing and
 
05:45:36.890 --> 05:45:36.900 align:start position:0%
somehow there's some vast conspiracy
 
05:45:38.690 --> 05:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
among planning board members
 
05:45:42.170 --> 05:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
to not allow Workforce housing if I'll
 
05:45:43.970 --> 05:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
probably I hope there's other members
 
05:45:45.890 --> 05:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
here from zbas or playing boards because
 
05:45:48.288 --> 05:45:48.298 align:start position:0%
I wanted to spell that myth I take my
 
05:45:50.810 --> 05:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
job very seriously as I do as I know the
 
05:45:53.090 --> 05:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
planning board does our appeal in town
 
05:45:56.810 --> 05:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:56.820 --> 05:45:59.090 align:start position:0%
 
I

05:45:59.090 --> 05:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:46:02.390 --> 05:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned that 13
 
05:46:04.990 --> 05:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
cases were
 
05:46:07.548 --> 05:46:07.558 align:start position:0%
the town decision playing board and
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
Zoning Board was overturned
 
05:46:11.628 --> 05:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
I think you ought to take a look at
 
05:46:13.730 --> 05:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
those decisions or maybe not because I
 
05:46:15.170 --> 05:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
don't think you can really tell I think
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
you need to speak to your zoning board
 
05:46:18.830 --> 05:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
or planning board what does it what
 
05:46:20.628 --> 05:46:20.638 align:start position:0%
decision went before them let me give
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
you a brief a very brief idea of what
 
05:46:25.850 --> 05:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
happened in my town
 
05:46:27.470 --> 05:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
there were two issues that went before
 
05:46:29.990 --> 05:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
they should the standard of review
 
05:46:33.170 --> 05:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
should be
 
05:46:37.128 --> 05:46:37.138 align:start position:0%
did that board have the the evidence
 
05:46:39.850 --> 05:46:39.860 align:start position:0%
before them to reach that decision
 
05:46:42.410 --> 05:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
Amherst decision from the hab doesn't
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
follow that standard of review they say
 
05:46:47.270 --> 05:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
they do but they don't one of them was a
 
05:46:49.310 --> 05:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
federal law question our planning board
 
05:46:51.048 --> 05:46:51.058 align:start position:0%
was given
 
05:46:53.510 --> 05:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
advice from Town Council
 
05:46:56.570 --> 05:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
that that case would not
 
05:46:58.490 --> 05:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
it would violate federal law the
 
05:46:59.810 --> 05:46:59.820 align:start position:0%
planning board was given that
 
05:47:02.510 --> 05:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
information and relied on it Hab came
 
05:47:02.520 --> 05:47:03.650 align:start position:0%
information and relied on it Hab came
back

05:47:03.650 --> 05:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
back
 
05:47:06.530 --> 05:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
the case slot was cited first off in the
 
05:47:08.990 --> 05:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
footnote the hab said
 
05:47:11.448 --> 05:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
oh that that's about two buildings that
 
05:47:13.128 --> 05:47:13.138 align:start position:0%
doesn't even apply
 
05:47:14.750 --> 05:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
file we file for a motion for
 
05:47:16.970 --> 05:47:16.980 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and explained why that
 
05:47:19.250 --> 05:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
federal law case was important came back
 
05:47:20.570 --> 05:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
the motion for reconsideration was
 
05:47:22.070 --> 05:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
denied as well
 
05:47:25.128 --> 05:47:25.138 align:start position:0%
well we looked at that federal case and
 
05:47:27.110 --> 05:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
no we don't see we don't see that
 
05:47:28.788 --> 05:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
happening that's not the standard review
 
05:47:32.270 --> 05:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
did the planning board have
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from their Town Council that
 
05:47:37.730 --> 05:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
that federal law applied yes they did
 
05:47:41.208 --> 05:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
the hab's not in charge of federal law
 
05:47:42.890 --> 05:47:42.900 align:start position:0%
they're only need they are only supposed
 
05:47:44.390 --> 05:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
to be looking at does the planning board
 
05:47:46.430 --> 05:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge given all the other
 
05:47:49.010 --> 05:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
evidence all the abutters that testified
 
05:47:51.410 --> 05:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
this this case went on there were
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
continuances by the applicant so that
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
was one that was one of our issues was
 
05:47:59.090 --> 05:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
the federal law so this had over said no
 
05:48:01.730 --> 05:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
go back to go back to the planning board
 
05:48:03.650 --> 05:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
work it out work it out with with the
 
05:48:03.660 --> 05:48:04.970 align:start position:0%
work it out work it out with with the
applicant

05:48:04.970 --> 05:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
applicant
 
05:48:07.850 --> 05:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
the other issue was a rural aesthetic
 
05:48:10.910 --> 05:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
that the Supreme Court in this state has
 
05:48:12.770 --> 05:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
acknowledged over many many many years
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
that towns have a right to preserve
 
05:48:17.570 --> 05:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
their rural aesthetic
 
05:48:20.090 --> 05:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
it was denied the site plan the
 
05:48:22.490 --> 05:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
subdivision site plan was denied on that
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
on that condition
 
05:48:28.070 --> 05:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
that rural aesthetic is determined at
 
05:48:30.048 --> 05:48:30.058 align:start position:0%
the site plan stage
 
05:48:32.150 --> 05:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
in the regulations is determined at the
 
05:48:35.030 --> 05:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
site plan stage the ham went back to a
 
05:48:36.590 --> 05:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit that the
 
05:48:38.810 --> 05:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
applicant was granted two years prior
 
05:48:41.208 --> 05:48:41.218 align:start position:0%
and made up their own definition of real
 
05:48:44.330 --> 05:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
aesthetic they said Amherst did not have
 
05:48:46.190 --> 05:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
a definition of rural aesthetic we have
 
05:48:49.368 --> 05:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
things in our in our regulations that I
 
05:48:51.530 --> 05:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
would disagree and then went back to a
 
05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit and said
 
05:48:56.448 --> 05:48:56.458 align:start position:0%
you agreed to rural back then even
 
05:48:58.368 --> 05:48:58.378 align:start position:0%
though it wasn't even considered at the
 
05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit so my point to
 
05:49:02.208 --> 05:49:02.218 align:start position:0%
all this is there are there are probably
 
05:49:03.770 --> 05:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
other decisions I know this case
 
05:49:06.708 --> 05:49:06.718 align:start position:0%
intimately so I can speak to it if you
 
05:49:08.090 --> 05:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
go back to your zoning boards and
 
05:49:10.250 --> 05:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
planning boards talk to them about it
 
05:49:12.048 --> 05:49:12.058 align:start position:0%
talk to them about the decision I know
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
there are towns who did not decide to
 
05:49:16.310 --> 05:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
appeal because it was a money issue as a
 
05:49:18.350 --> 05:49:18.360 align:start position:0%
selective in my town that was a big
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
concern how much is this going to cost
 
05:49:22.430 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
us but it was a bad decision we had no
 
05:49:22.440 --> 05:49:23.390 align:start position:0%
us but it was a bad decision we had no
choice

05:49:23.390 --> 05:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
now I'll get to the appeal part
 
05:49:28.490 --> 05:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
so everybody thinks oh you can appeal it
 
05:49:30.830 --> 05:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court sure you can
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
we just found out it's rule 10 they
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to take it we don't even know
 
05:49:37.310 --> 05:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get heard in front of
 
05:49:40.368 --> 05:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
the justices so one attorney that makes
 
05:49:43.070 --> 05:49:43.080 align:start position:0%
up this Hab and two other people who are
 
05:49:44.570 --> 05:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
involved in the real estate develop
 
05:49:44.580 --> 05:49:46.490 align:start position:0%
involved in the real estate develop
field

05:49:46.490 --> 05:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
field
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
made a determination on our legal case
 
05:49:51.110 --> 05:49:51.120 align:start position:0%
they're not trained in the law they
 
05:49:53.390 --> 05:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't know legal analysis and that is an
 
05:49:55.970 --> 05:49:55.980 align:start position:0%
appellate position what do they know
 
05:49:58.970 --> 05:49:58.980 align:start position:0%
about case law in New Hampshire
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
05:50:02.750 --> 05:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
um we
 
05:50:05.628 --> 05:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
you need to fix it I think the I think
 
05:50:07.250 --> 05:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
some amendments if you don't repeal it
 
05:50:09.770 --> 05:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
some amendments that were offered the
 
05:50:11.208 --> 05:50:11.218 align:start position:0%
previous bill
 
05:50:13.610 --> 05:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh I would add there should be a zoning
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
board or planning board member part of
 
05:50:17.868 --> 05:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
this commission they're the ones who for
 
05:50:21.170 --> 05:50:21.180 align:start position:0%
years sit every month in your towns and
 
05:50:23.690 --> 05:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
listen and follow the ordinances they're
 
05:50:25.788 --> 05:50:25.798 align:start position:0%
not making up things as they go I would
 
05:50:27.288 --> 05:50:27.298 align:start position:0%
take exception to that that's making the
 
05:50:28.910 --> 05:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
zoning board and Boogeyman in every town
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
in this state the boogeyman because
 
05:50:34.070 --> 05:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is an affordable housing that's
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
your issue to solve
 
05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
there there's always been an appeal
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
process available Workforce housing
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
builders remedy six months what changed
 
05:50:47.570 --> 05:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
six months that's pretty quick
 
05:50:50.330 --> 05:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
but bad decisions coming from a
 
05:50:50.340 --> 05:50:51.170 align:start position:0%
but bad decisions coming from a
um

05:50:51.170 --> 05:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:54.770 --> 05:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
a Hab where there's one attorney who by
 
05:50:56.090 --> 05:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
the way worked for Real Estate
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
developers it's it's pretty clear to me
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
that the makeup of this is not what it
 
05:51:03.830 --> 05:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
should be we should be entitled to have
 
05:51:05.810 --> 05:51:05.820 align:start position:0%
something in front of a judge someone
 
05:51:08.270 --> 05:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
who knows legal analysis and can
 
05:51:10.850 --> 05:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
interpret the law and and tell you
 
05:51:13.490 --> 05:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah Tyler you didn't do this right I
 
05:51:15.288 --> 05:51:15.298 align:start position:0%
think and it's kind of interesting I
 
05:51:16.670 --> 05:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't know the statistics if I had time
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
I would have done it I was going to go
 
05:51:20.570 --> 05:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
back 20 or 30 years and look at the
 
05:51:22.250 --> 05:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
superior court and Supreme Court cases
 
05:51:24.288 --> 05:51:24.298 align:start position:0%
where towns were upheld I bet it's a
 
05:51:26.390 --> 05:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
complete flip of what we're seeing now
 
05:51:29.208 --> 05:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
if those are that's before judges that's
 
05:51:30.590 --> 05:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
before The Supreme Court and the
 
05:51:33.770 --> 05:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
superior court so don't go by this 13 or
 
05:51:35.570 --> 05:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
15. talk to those towns talk to those
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
planning boards and those zoning boards
 
05:51:39.650 --> 05:51:39.660 align:start position:0%
and find out where those decisions are
 
05:51:41.208 --> 05:51:41.218 align:start position:0%
wrong because I know there's people that
 
05:51:42.410 --> 05:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
say that's wrong but we just can't
 
05:51:44.510 --> 05:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
afford to go on
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my testimony thank you for
 
05:51:49.250 --> 05:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
listening and hopefully you'll make some
 
05:51:51.170 --> 05:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
changes if you don't repeal it I would
 
05:51:54.410 --> 05:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
repeal it I liked representative Boyd's
 
05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you make this on land
 
05:51:57.948 --> 05:51:57.958 align:start position:0%
core it is someone that is trained in
 
05:52:01.070 --> 05:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
the law knows legal analysis specific to
 
05:52:04.250 --> 05:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
those issues so if you do not repeal it
 
05:52:07.010 --> 05:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
I would I would encourage you immensely
 
05:52:10.010 --> 05:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
to go that route and the other changes
 
05:52:12.288 --> 05:52:12.298 align:start position:0%
from the previous
 
05:52:14.628 --> 05:52:14.638 align:start position:0%
bill I
 
05:52:17.208 --> 05:52:17.218 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to if you don't do
 
05:52:19.490 --> 05:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
any of that but a zoning someone who has
 
05:52:21.410 --> 05:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
practice on a zoning board or a planning
 
05:52:22.970 --> 05:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
board for years in this town to put on
 
05:52:25.730 --> 05:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
this on this board because right now
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
um your talents are not represented and
 
05:52:29.270 --> 05:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
that means your constituents aren't
 
05:52:31.368 --> 05:52:31.378 align:start position:0%
representative all the citizens in your
 
05:52:34.368 --> 05:52:34.378 align:start position:0%
town who rely on they voted for those
 
05:52:34.378 --> 05:52:36.048 align:start position:0%
town who rely on they voted for those
ordinances

05:52:36.048 --> 05:52:36.058 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
05:52:38.090 --> 05:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
so it even goes further back than your
 
05:52:39.590 --> 05:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
your town zoning boards and planning
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
boards U.S constituents are not
 
05:52:42.890 --> 05:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
represented this is costing them more
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
this is costing My Town more because we
 
05:52:46.970 --> 05:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
have to appeal it and we don't even know
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going to get before The Supreme
 
05:52:51.288 --> 05:52:51.298 align:start position:0%
Court so
 
05:52:52.670 --> 05:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
all right enough we got too many people
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
to talk well then does anybody have any
 
05:52:58.910 --> 05:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
05:53:00.840 --> 05:53:04.788 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:07.310 --> 05:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
we are uh
 
05:53:09.048 --> 05:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
a little bit pressed for time I just
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
note that I tend to alternate between
 
05:53:15.048 --> 05:53:15.058 align:start position:0%
pros and cons and I have one more person
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
who's speaking in favor and nine people
 
05:53:20.330 --> 05:53:20.340 align:start position:0%
who are speaking against so
 
05:53:20.340 --> 05:53:21.770 align:start position:0%
who are speaking against so
um

05:53:21.770 --> 05:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:23.690 --> 05:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that because if you're
 
05:53:25.128 --> 05:53:25.138 align:start position:0%
one of those people speaking against I'm
 
05:53:27.350 --> 05:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
not sure we need to put on all that much
 
05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
more weight so
 
05:53:44.930 --> 05:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:47.270 --> 05:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
05:53:48.890 --> 05:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
name is David I'm a senior vice
 
05:53:51.470 --> 05:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
president for the business and industry

Association and for the next three weeks
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
serving as its interim president I'm
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
here in strong opposition to this bill
 
05:54:00.890 --> 05:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
the issue of Workforce housing is a key
 
05:54:02.948 --> 05:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
issue for employers throughout the state
 
05:54:06.770 --> 05:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
please find this bill in expedient I'm
 
05:54:08.690 --> 05:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
05:54:10.430 --> 05:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm doing my part to move this along
 
05:54:13.730 --> 05:54:13.740 align:start position:0%
you're doing you're doing terrific so
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions
 
05:54:18.410 --> 05:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
the questions might okay the probably
 
05:54:19.730 --> 05:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
the question will take longer than the
 
05:54:21.708 --> 05:54:21.718 align:start position:0%
testimony go ahead representative wolper
 
05:54:25.128 --> 05:54:25.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I will be brief
 
05:54:27.548 --> 05:54:27.558 align:start position:0%
could you just just briefly say why
 
05:54:30.350 --> 05:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing as opposed to is
 
05:54:31.610 --> 05:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
something that
 
05:54:34.490 --> 05:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
why you are thinking why the hab is so
 
05:54:36.288 --> 05:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
important for Workforce housing yeah
 
05:54:38.330 --> 05:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
it's an issue for the Bia because it's a
 
05:54:41.030 --> 05:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
significant issue for our members from
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
around the state business is larger and
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
small have indicated to us they're
 
05:54:47.150 --> 05:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
having a hard time finding employees and
 
05:54:49.128 --> 05:54:49.138 align:start position:0%
retaining employees because there is
 
05:54:51.410 --> 05:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
insufficient place for these individuals
 
05:54:53.090 --> 05:54:53.100 align:start position:0%
to live within proximity of the
 
05:54:53.100 --> 05:54:58.070 align:start position:0%
to live within proximity of the
workplace

05:54:58.070 --> 05:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.080 --> 05:54:59.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:54:59.510 --> 05:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:55:02.150 --> 05:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
so what does the hab add to how does
 
05:55:05.208 --> 05:55:05.218 align:start position:0%
that alleviate your issue we believe one
 
05:55:07.010 --> 05:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that there's insufficient
 
05:55:09.410 --> 05:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
work for uh Workforce housing around the
 
05:55:11.628 --> 05:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
state is because of decisions that are
 
05:55:13.910 --> 05:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
made at the local level that do not
 
05:55:16.610 --> 05:55:16.620 align:start position:0%
comply or follow in the spirit of state
 
05:55:19.270 --> 05:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
law or case law in New Hampshire
 
05:55:22.430 --> 05:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
up until the creation of the housing
 
05:55:24.170 --> 05:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
appeals board the only recourse a
 
05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
developer had was to take that town to
 
05:55:28.730 --> 05:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
court which is both expensive and time
 
05:55:30.830 --> 05:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
consuming the sponsor of the bill
 
05:55:33.708 --> 05:55:33.718 align:start position:0%
alluded mentioned that he thought the
 
05:55:36.048 --> 05:55:36.058 align:start position:0%
hab the housing appeals board was an
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
additional bureaucracy I would say it's
 
05:55:41.090 --> 05:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
an alternative bureaucracy it's designed
 
05:55:44.410 --> 05:55:44.420 align:start position:0%
to give the developer a quick fast
 
05:55:47.208 --> 05:55:47.218 align:start position:0%
appeals process without having to go to
 
05:55:47.218 --> 05:55:50.090 align:start position:0%
appeals process without having to go to
court

05:55:50.090 --> 05:55:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:52.490 --> 05:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:55:55.610 --> 05:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
see none thank you Mr Dubai
 
05:56:00.830 --> 05:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:03.288 --> 05:56:03.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure um
 
05:56:08.448 --> 05:56:08.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.830 --> 05:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:24.110 --> 05:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:25.970 --> 05:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll do my best to
 
05:56:28.368 --> 05:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
be well not quite as brief as my friend
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
Dave Gervais but I'll do my best Ben
 
05:56:33.230 --> 05:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
Frost from New Hampshire housing I'm
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
here to speak in opposition with the
 
05:56:37.190 --> 05:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill and I have another letter which I
 
05:56:43.730 --> 05:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.530 --> 05:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
05:56:45.540 --> 05:56:46.670 align:start position:0%
it's been
uh

05:56:46.670 --> 05:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:56:48.708 --> 05:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
the housing situation of the state's
 
05:56:51.230 --> 05:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
been talked a lot about and about the
 
05:56:52.850 --> 05:56:52.860 align:start position:0%
details are in the letter I'll let you
 
05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
see that for yourselves we all know that
 
05:56:58.368 --> 05:56:58.378 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis of housing Supply the
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board was conceived of
 
05:57:00.840 --> 05:57:01.788 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board was conceived of
as

05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:57:04.310 --> 05:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
part of a solution to that not not a
 
05:57:07.250 --> 05:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
Panacea but a measure that the state
 
05:57:09.708 --> 05:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
could take to help improve the housing
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
Supply and this really reflects the
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
notion that I believe is true that there
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
was a latent demand for appeals of local
 
05:57:20.930 --> 05:57:20.940 align:start position:0%
decisions on housing and Housing
 
05:57:20.940 --> 05:57:22.128 align:start position:0%
decisions on housing and Housing
Development

05:57:22.128 --> 05:57:22.138 align:start position:0%
Development
 
05:57:24.230 --> 05:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
appeals that were not being made because
 
05:57:26.810 --> 05:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
of the the time and cost that is
 
05:57:29.270 --> 05:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
involved in making those appeals when
 
05:57:31.548 --> 05:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
you go to Superior Court the housing
 
05:57:35.930 --> 05:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
appeals board meets that by creating a
 
05:57:39.170 --> 05:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
faster less expensive in many cases
 
05:57:41.810 --> 05:57:41.820 align:start position:0%
alternative to Superior Court that
 
05:57:44.270 --> 05:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
applies the same legal standards as are
 
05:57:48.410 --> 05:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:50.448 --> 05:57:50.458 align:start position:0%
and that is that is covered in the in
 
05:57:53.208 --> 05:57:53.218 align:start position:0%
the letter that have submitted to you
 
05:57:55.490 --> 05:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I would reiterate what Senator gaida
 
05:57:57.230 --> 05:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
said please read the decisions of the
 
05:57:59.750 --> 05:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board these are
 
05:58:02.570 --> 05:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
um they reflect careful analysis and a
 
05:58:04.430 --> 05:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
balanced approach that neither favors
 
05:58:05.990 --> 05:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
one side nor the other the fact that
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
they come down the majority of have them
 
05:58:10.490 --> 05:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
the majority of them have come down in
 
05:58:12.830 --> 05:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
favor of developers I think is simply
 
05:58:14.750 --> 05:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
indicative of the fact that these are
 
05:58:16.128 --> 05:58:16.138 align:start position:0%
the people who are bringing the appeals
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
right now but
 
05:58:20.750 --> 05:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
um what you get with the housing appeal
 
05:58:22.850 --> 05:58:22.860 align:start position:0%
sport that you would not get with a land
 
05:58:26.030 --> 05:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
use court or a land use docket is the
 
05:58:28.490 --> 05:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
time the quickness of decisions the
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
flexibility of making the appeals such
 
05:58:34.070 --> 05:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
as the The Rules of Evidence which like
 
05:58:36.288 --> 05:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
the btla Do Not Apply in the housing
 
05:58:39.770 --> 05:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
appeals board courts are really much
 
05:58:42.350 --> 05:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
tighter in in what uh evidence can be
 
05:58:44.330 --> 05:58:44.340 align:start position:0%
presented although these are just like
 
05:58:46.390 --> 05:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
the courts heard on the record
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
non-attorney representation is permitted
 
05:58:51.288 --> 05:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
in the housing appeals board you can't
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
have your engineer or your surveyor
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
representing you in court in court but
 
05:58:59.150 --> 05:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
you can in the housing appeals board
 
05:59:01.610 --> 05:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
likewise municipalities if they want to
 
05:59:04.310 --> 05:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
represent themselves in in the housing
 
05:59:05.750 --> 05:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
appeals board they can have their their
 
05:59:07.250 --> 05:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
Town planner do that if they want to
 
05:59:09.170 --> 05:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have the town
 
05:59:09.180 --> 05:59:10.090 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have the town
attorney

05:59:10.090 --> 05:59:10.100 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
presenting their case this really
 
05:59:16.670 --> 05:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
represents a a presents a lower cost of
 
05:59:19.730 --> 05:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
access to justice for Developers for
 
05:59:22.128 --> 05:59:22.138 align:start position:0%
anyone who's exercising their rights
 
05:59:23.810 --> 05:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
before a local board including a Butters
 
05:59:26.448 --> 05:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
too a Butters can bring a case before
 
05:59:28.190 --> 05:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's an easier place to get to Justice
 
05:59:34.190 --> 05:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately the housing appeals board is
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
about holding governmental bodies
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
accountable for their actions and I say
 
05:59:43.730 --> 05:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
that as as the chairman of my own Town's
 
05:59:44.930 --> 05:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
planning board I'm not speaking for the
 
05:59:46.190 --> 05:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
planning board that's but that's a
 
05:59:48.410 --> 05:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
position I hold uh in the Town of Warner
 
05:59:51.548 --> 05:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's a position I take very seriously
 
05:59:55.788 --> 05:59:55.798 align:start position:0%
and I I can tell you I'm not worried
 
05:59:57.890 --> 05:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
about the housing appealsport speaking
 
05:59:59.868 --> 05:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
as the chairman of my Town's planning
 
06:00:02.150 --> 06:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
board I feel confident in the decisions
 
06:00:04.128 --> 06:00:04.138 align:start position:0%
that we make because I know that we're
 
06:00:06.288 --> 06:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
applying the law
 
06:00:09.310 --> 06:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
are applying our our rules uh
 
06:00:11.208 --> 06:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
even-handedly to everyone who comes
 
06:00:13.730 --> 06:00:13.740 align:start position:0%
before us and if someone chooses to
 
06:00:15.770 --> 06:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
appeal a decision to the housing appeals
 
06:00:17.868 --> 06:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
board that my board makes fine we'll
 
06:00:19.910 --> 06:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
take the consequences uh and that's okay
 
06:00:21.288 --> 06:00:21.298 align:start position:0%
with me
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I've been a professional planner for
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
35 years advising communities I've been
 
06:00:28.448 --> 06:00:28.458 align:start position:0%
an attorney
 
06:00:31.970 --> 06:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
representing municipalities and Advising
 
06:00:35.628 --> 06:00:35.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities for 25 years I see this
 
06:00:39.890 --> 06:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
as a real win for everyone for the the
 
06:00:41.990 --> 06:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
Developers for the property owners who
 
06:00:43.490 --> 06:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
are trying to exercise their rights
 
06:00:45.650 --> 06:00:45.660 align:start position:0%
before local boards
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
for the butters who want to have their
 
06:00:51.830 --> 06:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
their their say and their day before an
 
06:00:54.350 --> 06:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
impartial tribunal and for the public
 
06:00:56.288 --> 06:00:56.298 align:start position:0%
and for the people of New Hampshire
 
06:00:58.910 --> 06:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good board and should be
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
preserved I'll be happy to take any
 
06:01:00.840 --> 06:01:02.448 align:start position:0%
preserved I'll be happy to take any
questions

06:01:02.448 --> 06:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:01:06.530 --> 06:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:09.230 --> 06:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:01:20.570 --> 06:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:22.730 --> 06:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
committee members thank you for the
 
06:01:26.810 --> 06:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak I do have written
 
06:01:34.850 --> 06:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh as I said I'm Ellen grow I am the
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
executive director of the Concord
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
coalition to end homelessness and I'm
 
06:01:44.948 --> 06:01:44.958 align:start position:0%
here to speak in opposition to this bill
 
06:01:48.048 --> 06:01:48.058 align:start position:0%
beyond the workflow Workforce housing
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
that it affects it affects the housing
 
06:01:53.150 --> 06:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
that our agency is trying to create
 
06:01:54.770 --> 06:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
so the Concord coalition to end
 
06:01:56.208 --> 06:01:56.218 align:start position:0%
homelessness is a non-profit
 
06:01:59.030 --> 06:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
organization we provide a lot of Crisis
 
06:02:00.770 --> 06:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
services for people who are homeless
 
06:02:03.590 --> 06:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
including a daytime Resource Center a
 
06:02:06.948 --> 06:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
winter shelter Outreach Services and all
 
06:02:09.830 --> 06:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
of those crisis services are really
 
06:02:12.410 --> 06:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
important but none of them actually end
 
06:02:15.350 --> 06:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
homelessness it's permanent housing that
 
06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
ends homelessness and the housing crisis
 
06:02:19.310 --> 06:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is having right now
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
is having a devastating impact on our
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
ability to move people from homelessness
 
06:02:27.530 --> 06:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
into permanent housing
 
06:02:30.170 --> 06:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that our agency has
 
06:02:32.510 --> 06:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
been increasingly focused on in the last
 
06:02:35.990 --> 06:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
several years is um is our permanent
 
06:02:38.330 --> 06:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
housing permanent Supportive Housing
 
06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
Programs where we can provide rental
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
assistance to people coming from
 
06:02:45.470 --> 06:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
homelessness along with ongoing case
 
06:02:47.628 --> 06:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
management support to help people stay
 
06:02:50.448 --> 06:02:50.458 align:start position:0%
stably housed most of the people that we
 
06:02:53.448 --> 06:02:53.458 align:start position:0%
serve have disability income as their
 
06:02:55.970 --> 06:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
only income so they're so they need that
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
rental assistance and they need that
 
06:03:00.530 --> 06:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
support to stay housed right now we have
 
06:03:02.690 --> 06:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
about six people who have rental
 
06:03:04.970 --> 06:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
vouchers in their hands that they could
 
06:03:07.310 --> 06:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
rent an apartment and it's probably been
 
06:03:10.250 --> 06:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
six months of looking they cannot find a
 
06:03:12.650 --> 06:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
place to use that rental voucher and if
 
06:03:15.230 --> 06:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
they do find an available apartment it's
 
06:03:17.150 --> 06:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
often the rent is too high the voucher
 
06:03:19.610 --> 06:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
won't cover it so we we are in a
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
desperate situation for more affordable
 
06:03:25.010 --> 06:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
housing a couple of years ago we stepped
 
06:03:26.930 --> 06:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
our feet into affordable housing
 
06:03:28.730 --> 06:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
development our ourselves even though
 
06:03:32.288 --> 06:03:32.298 align:start position:0%
we're very small agency and we converted
 
06:03:35.208 --> 06:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
a downtown office building in Concord
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
into four one-bedroom apartments for
 
06:03:40.070 --> 06:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
people coming from homelessness and
 
06:03:42.530 --> 06:03:42.540 align:start position:0%
they're occupied now the people are very
 
06:03:45.350 --> 06:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
happy in their new homes we had to get
 
06:03:48.590 --> 06:03:48.600 align:start position:0%
several variances for that project and
 
06:03:50.930 --> 06:03:50.940 align:start position:0%
we went before our zoning board and they
 
06:03:53.510 --> 06:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
were all granted
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
um if if those if that had been appealed
 
06:04:00.590 --> 06:04:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the process dragged on it wouldn't
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have affected a profit to us it
 
06:04:05.208 --> 06:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
would have killed our project we don't
 
06:04:07.730 --> 06:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
have the finances to to uh go through a
 
06:04:10.850 --> 06:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
protracted legal battle our funding
 
06:04:12.530 --> 06:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
sources we get a lot of subsidized
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
funding sources to do our work and those
 
06:04:16.970 --> 06:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
have deadlines on them those it would
 
06:04:18.770 --> 06:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
have killed our project
 
06:04:20.810 --> 06:04:20.820 align:start position:0%
we're about to embark on our second
 
06:04:23.390 --> 06:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
project to create eight units in Concord
 
06:04:25.970 --> 06:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
again for people coming from long-term
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
homelessness and one of the reasons that
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
we feel confident going ahead is that we
 
06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
know that if there is a zoning appeal by
 
06:04:36.650 --> 06:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
either us or the um or the uh the other
 
06:04:40.310 --> 06:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
side that it will be that is a
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
a process that's predictable and fast so
 
06:04:45.170 --> 06:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
that we can have the confidence to make
 
06:04:47.208 --> 06:04:47.218 align:start position:0%
the Investments that we have to make to
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
go forward with surveys and everything
 
06:04:51.708 --> 06:04:51.718 align:start position:0%
else it's a costly process and it would
 
06:04:54.770 --> 06:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
be out of our reach if
 
06:04:58.070 --> 06:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
we really need this to keep it um to
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
make this all work to get the housing we
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
need for people who are homeless so that
 
06:05:05.390 --> 06:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
I have more in the letter that you can
 
06:05:07.430 --> 06:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
read I'm trying to be brief if you have
 
06:05:10.610 --> 06:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
any questions happy to answer them
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay any questions where Miss grow yes
 
06:05:15.650 --> 06:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
representative nodder thank you Mr
 
06:05:16.910 --> 06:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
06:05:16.920 --> 06:05:18.170 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
question

06:05:18.170 --> 06:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:20.750 --> 06:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
um what do you think of converting an
 
06:05:24.470 --> 06:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
old hotel into individual tiny homes
 
06:05:26.750 --> 06:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
I think it has a lot of Promise There's
 
06:05:28.970 --> 06:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
issues with it as well
 
06:05:31.010 --> 06:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit off topic from this
 
06:05:34.368 --> 06:05:34.378 align:start position:0%
perhaps but um they're doing that in a
 
06:05:36.230 --> 06:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
lot of larger cities and I think there's
 
06:05:39.770 --> 06:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of promise to that idea
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
follow up I mentioned it because
 
06:05:43.970 --> 06:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony um you were
 
06:05:45.350 --> 06:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
talking about the housing shortage and
 
06:05:46.670 --> 06:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
all that and this is something I
 
06:05:48.948 --> 06:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
discussed with someone a couple weeks
 
06:05:51.288 --> 06:05:51.298 align:start position:0%
ago I just wanted to run it by yeah no
 
06:05:52.850 --> 06:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of promise to that there's
 
06:05:54.170 --> 06:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of different ways people are going
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
about it in different cities
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you know there's issues that have to
 
06:05:59.990 --> 06:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
be dealt with a lot of times but it but
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:07.128 --> 06:06:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:09.110 --> 06:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you thank you very
 
06:06:13.250 --> 06:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:17.030 --> 06:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:18.650 --> 06:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully I got it
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:24.600 --> 06:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:06:29.150 --> 06:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Alyssa marglin
 
06:06:31.190 --> 06:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
I serve as director of housing action
 
06:06:33.650 --> 06:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a Statewide Coalition of
 
06:06:35.208 --> 06:06:35.218 align:start position:0%
80 organizations United around
 
06:06:36.650 --> 06:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and ending
 
06:06:39.170 --> 06:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
homelessness we'd like to express our
 
06:06:40.868 --> 06:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
1216. as I noted before we do see this
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
as an opportunity to address concerns
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
and debunk some of those myths I know
 
06:06:50.868 --> 06:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:06:53.448 --> 06:06:53.458 align:start position:0%
uh you want to move your hearing along
 
06:06:55.250 --> 06:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so I just want to focus on
 
06:06:57.590 --> 06:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
something I did not address in the prior
 
06:06:57.600 --> 06:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
something I did not address in the prior
hearing

06:06:59.990 --> 06:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
06:07:03.288 --> 06:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
um I do want to talk about the fact that
 
06:07:04.970 --> 06:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
this housing appeals board was really
 
06:07:08.090 --> 06:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
designed specifically not to have any
 
06:07:09.948 --> 06:07:09.958 align:start position:0%
impact on local control it was
 
06:07:11.570 --> 06:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
specifically designed to provide that
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
fast review subject matter expertise but
 
06:07:16.730 --> 06:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
only after local reviews are exhausted
 
06:07:18.708 --> 06:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
and that language can be found in RSA
 
06:07:22.990 --> 06:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
679 colon 5 Roman numeral four
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
in fact the review board only has
 
06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
concurrent jurisdiction with the Syria
 
06:07:31.190 --> 06:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
Superior Court it was even noted in a
 
06:07:32.930 --> 06:07:32.940 align:start position:0%
legislative bulletin from the New
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association that
 
06:07:38.030 --> 06:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
read the board applies the same law and
 
06:07:39.770 --> 06:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
same standards that a judge would apply
 
06:07:42.048 --> 06:07:42.058 align:start position:0%
so municipality would not be prejudiced
 
06:07:44.270 --> 06:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
by having an appeal brought to the board
 
06:07:47.810 --> 06:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
rather than to the court a couple of
 
06:07:51.530 --> 06:07:51.540 align:start position:0%
other uh key key myths to address a
 
06:07:53.990 --> 06:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board cannot rewrite
 
06:07:57.048 --> 06:07:57.058 align:start position:0%
local zoning it cannot change
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
subdivision rigs or site plan regulation
 
06:08:01.010 --> 06:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
stations or change your local master
 
06:08:03.288 --> 06:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
plan or change the rules of your
 
06:08:05.208 --> 06:08:05.218 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or your historic
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
district commission it cannot impose its
 
06:08:10.730 --> 06:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
own view of planning it can't can't be
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
urge you to go in a smart growth
 
06:08:14.990 --> 06:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
Direction it simply reviews specific
 
06:08:17.208 --> 06:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
cases according to established laws and
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
ordinances just like Superior Court it's
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
faster it's therefore less expensive and
 
06:08:25.250 --> 06:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
it comes with expertise
 
06:08:28.430 --> 06:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
um this uh opportunity to avoid a
 
06:08:31.270 --> 06:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
lengthy costly litigation
 
06:08:35.448 --> 06:08:35.458 align:start position:0%
helps local landowners also they can
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
represent themselves per se in fact at a
 
06:08:40.910 --> 06:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
recent presentation by the housing
 
06:08:42.170 --> 06:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
appeals board they said they just had
 
06:08:44.570 --> 06:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
their first prosec case and it went well
 
06:08:47.890 --> 06:08:47.900 align:start position:0%
so arguably in enhancing
 
06:08:50.930 --> 06:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
local property rights and opportunities
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
for local property owners
 
06:08:56.330 --> 06:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
that who want to take up issues
 
06:08:58.850 --> 06:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
impacting their private property they
 
06:09:01.368 --> 06:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
too can access fast review of their
 
06:09:04.670 --> 06:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
cases at much less expense the final
 
06:09:07.010 --> 06:09:07.020 align:start position:0%
myth I just want to address is that that
 
06:09:08.930 --> 06:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
somehow this housing appeals appeals
 
06:09:11.090 --> 06:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
board is is in favor of the developers
 
06:09:14.628 --> 06:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's only in favor of the law as
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
established it applies the same
 
06:09:20.510 --> 06:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
standards for case review finally board
 
06:09:22.310 --> 06:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
seats are not political appointments
 
06:09:26.090 --> 06:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
they are appointed by the Supreme Court
 
06:09:26.100 --> 06:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
they are appointed by the Supreme Court
um

06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:30.430 --> 06:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
and so uh I think I'll conclude it there
 
06:09:34.850 --> 06:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
and be happy to take any questions
 
06:09:39.288 --> 06:09:39.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:43.368 --> 06:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:48.530 --> 06:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:51.048 --> 06:09:51.058 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you again for speaking I
 
06:09:52.750 --> 06:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
can be very brief
 
06:09:55.310 --> 06:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
the landlord Community will support
 
06:09:57.410 --> 06:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
anything that
 
06:09:57.420 --> 06:09:58.548 align:start position:0%
anything that
um

06:09:58.548 --> 06:09:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:00.770 --> 06:10:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're in favor of making better movement
 
06:10:02.690 --> 06:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
towards more affordable housing we feel
 
06:10:04.730 --> 06:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
the appeals board is a step towards
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
creating more affordable housing we
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
would not want to see it repealed
 
06:10:10.250 --> 06:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
everything that I've heard today
 
06:10:10.260 --> 06:10:12.770 align:start position:0%
everything that I've heard today
supports

06:10:12.770 --> 06:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
supports
 
06:10:16.310 --> 06:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
continuing and letting this play out
 
06:10:17.868 --> 06:10:17.878 align:start position:0%
I'm done
 
06:10:20.930 --> 06:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr Norman
 
06:10:22.670 --> 06:10:22.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for your
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
brief testimony
 
06:10:33.048 --> 06:10:33.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:35.628 --> 06:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again Mr chair members of
 
06:10:38.390 --> 06:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee Chris Norwood the 2022
 
06:10:39.708 --> 06:10:39.718 align:start position:0%
public policy chair for the New
 
06:10:42.048 --> 06:10:42.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors a few
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
brief points
 
06:10:45.170 --> 06:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
um when this went through the
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
legislative process and it was passed
 
06:10:48.890 --> 06:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
there were municipalities that were in
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
favor and so I'd like to dispel the
 
06:10:52.970 --> 06:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
myths that this is developers versus
 
06:10:55.548 --> 06:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities there were municipalities
 
06:10:57.470 --> 06:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
who testified in favor because of the
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
expediency and the cost savings that
 
06:11:01.910 --> 06:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
they would incur as well
 
06:11:04.128 --> 06:11:04.138 align:start position:0%
um I would also you know we talked about
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh hearing these cases reading through
 
06:11:09.230 --> 06:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
these cases uh furthering what uh
 
06:11:11.390 --> 06:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
Senator Guida had said a number of these
 
06:11:14.030 --> 06:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
cases were um sent back to the
 
06:11:16.430 --> 06:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities for a re-hearing so I
 
06:11:17.930 --> 06:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
also want to make sure that there's not
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
this this concept that there's this uh
 
06:11:22.670 --> 06:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
Invisible Hand of government uh that is
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
taking over a planning board's decisions
 
06:11:26.750 --> 06:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
no in some cases it's saying hey the
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
town said this is the land use code that
 
06:11:32.810 --> 06:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
we wanted to adhere to and to put it in
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
my words not the housing appeal Birds
 
06:11:39.230 --> 06:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
words uh the the local uh government
 
06:11:42.170 --> 06:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
body went rogue and uh went against the
 
06:11:44.990 --> 06:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
will of the voters that established uh
 
06:11:47.030 --> 06:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
the various uh planning zoning
 
06:11:49.010 --> 06:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
ordinances within their town so they
 
06:11:51.288 --> 06:11:51.298 align:start position:0%
they asked for a re-hearing or ask
 
06:11:53.208 --> 06:11:53.218 align:start position:0%
excuse me the housing appeals board
 
06:11:56.770 --> 06:11:56.780 align:start position:0%
asked that the town have a re-hearing
 
06:11:58.970 --> 06:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about Workforce
 
06:12:00.530 --> 06:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
housing I just want to clarify this is
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
for all how housing not just Workforce
 
06:12:05.150 --> 06:12:05.160 align:start position:0%
housing and the last thing I would just
 
06:12:06.590 --> 06:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
say is that I do think that the current
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
makeup of the housing appeals board is
 
06:12:11.570 --> 06:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
appropriate you having a lawyer and then
 
06:12:15.288 --> 06:12:15.298 align:start position:0%
a a civil engineer or a land surveyor
 
06:12:17.270 --> 06:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
and then it's someone who's learned it
 
06:12:20.030 --> 06:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
in land use and or development I think
 
06:12:21.770 --> 06:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
that that is a higher standard than the
 
06:12:23.810 --> 06:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
the current makeup of most planning
 
06:12:25.970 --> 06:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
boards and zoning boards which is uh
 
06:12:27.830 --> 06:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
which is appropriate for an appellate
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
body so I thank you for allowing me the
 
06:12:30.600 --> 06:12:32.150 align:start position:0%
body so I thank you for allowing me the
testimony

06:12:32.150 --> 06:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:12:36.890 --> 06:12:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:39.410 --> 06:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:12:40.850 --> 06:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who'd like to
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:51.410 --> 06:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
06:12:53.690 --> 06:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
the board my name is John Cronin I'm an
 
06:12:55.368 --> 06:12:55.378 align:start position:0%
attorney from Manchester I've been in
 
06:12:57.430 --> 06:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
the land use business for over 30 years
 
06:13:00.770 --> 06:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
I spent about two or three weeks nights
 
06:13:02.868 --> 06:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
a week at different zoning and planning
 
06:13:04.970 --> 06:13:04.980 align:start position:0%
boards and I'm opposed to this
 
06:13:07.128 --> 06:13:07.138 align:start position:0%
legislation I think the housing appeals
 
06:13:10.310 --> 06:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
board is a great tool not only for
 
06:13:12.530 --> 06:13:12.540 align:start position:0%
developers and landowners but also for
 
06:13:12.540 --> 06:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
developers and landowners but also for
communities

06:13:13.670 --> 06:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:13:15.770 --> 06:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh anyone that spent time in the
 
06:13:18.048 --> 06:13:18.058 align:start position:0%
superior court and probably had hundreds
 
06:13:20.628 --> 06:13:20.638 align:start position:0%
of cases and land use and appeals in the
 
06:13:23.150 --> 06:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they do a great job
 
06:13:25.610 --> 06:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
they're very busy but the way these
 
06:13:27.410 --> 06:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
cases are presented are by offer of
 
06:13:30.288 --> 06:13:30.298 align:start position:0%
proof and a record and when I started in
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
the 80s your subdivision and site plan
 
06:13:34.788 --> 06:13:34.798 align:start position:0%
regulations might be a few pages
 
06:13:37.368 --> 06:13:37.378 align:start position:0%
today they're complex they're like books
 
06:13:40.310 --> 06:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're very difficult to manage and
 
06:13:42.048 --> 06:13:42.058 align:start position:0%
it's rare to find one of our Superior
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
Court judges no matter how smart they
 
06:13:46.910 --> 06:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
are they'd ever spent a moment in a zba
 
06:13:48.350 --> 06:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
or a planning board
 
06:13:50.090 --> 06:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
and they're getting these cases to
 
06:13:52.368 --> 06:13:52.378 align:start position:0%
presented to them on appeal through some
 
06:13:55.010 --> 06:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
records with no live testimony it's very
 
06:13:57.590 --> 06:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible for them and
 
06:13:59.270 --> 06:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think if you talk to the Superior
 
06:14:01.548 --> 06:14:01.558 align:start position:0%
Court judges many of them would tell you
 
06:14:04.190 --> 06:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
that their least favorite cases are land
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
use appeals because they simply don't
 
06:14:08.570 --> 06:14:08.580 align:start position:0%
have the subject matter expertise
 
06:14:10.610 --> 06:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
I've had a number of cases and have
 
06:14:13.208 --> 06:14:13.218 align:start position:0%
others pending up at the appeals board
 
06:14:16.128 --> 06:14:16.138 align:start position:0%
you have three people that have lived
 
06:14:18.590 --> 06:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
the business of land use they understand
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
what the record looks like they
 
06:14:23.930 --> 06:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
understand the engineering data and they
 
06:14:26.090 --> 06:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
can make informed decisions not to
 
06:14:27.830 --> 06:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
substitute their judgment for the local
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
boards and all of them are well
 
06:14:32.390 --> 06:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
intentioned people volunteer time for
 
06:14:34.910 --> 06:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
the most part they do their best but
 
06:14:37.310 --> 06:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's an overwhelming task for them to
 
06:14:39.048 --> 06:14:39.058 align:start position:0%
understand it and to confront the
 
06:14:40.490 --> 06:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
pressures that they have from some of
 
06:14:42.830 --> 06:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
their community members to prevent
 
06:14:45.410 --> 06:14:45.420 align:start position:0%
development but not in my backyard the
 
06:14:48.230 --> 06:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
social media communities I certainly
 
06:14:50.150 --> 06:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
agree with Mr Frost that this is not a
 
06:14:52.570 --> 06:14:52.580 align:start position:0%
Panacea appearing in the Massachusetts
 
06:14:56.390 --> 06:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
land Court that's a great resource I'd
 
06:14:58.368 --> 06:14:58.378 align:start position:0%
love to see one in New Hampshire I
 
06:15:00.170 --> 06:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
recognize it's very expensive and
 
06:15:03.350 --> 06:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
probably will not happen in my career I
 
06:15:05.270 --> 06:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
also have strong opinions about home
 
06:15:07.670 --> 06:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
rule and some of the ways that many of
 
06:15:09.430 --> 06:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
our land use boards do their business
 
06:15:11.810 --> 06:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
most don't have the benefit of the
 
06:15:13.730 --> 06:15:13.740 align:start position:0%
speakers we had before Miss Craig I
 
06:15:16.448 --> 06:15:16.458 align:start position:0%
believe and Mr Frost who are trained
 
06:15:18.650 --> 06:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
professionals and probably are the leads
 
06:15:21.170 --> 06:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
in their respective boards but for today
 
06:15:23.690 --> 06:15:23.700 align:start position:0%
it would be a shame to displace this
 
06:15:25.730 --> 06:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
board and I think what the legislature
 
06:15:27.890 --> 06:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
should be looking at is maybe to have a
 
06:15:30.830 --> 06:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide land use board maybe for a fee
 
06:15:33.530 --> 06:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
that developers can get in and out from
 
06:15:36.650 --> 06:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
start to finish because right now the
 
06:15:39.530 --> 06:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
cost of development is so expensive and
 
06:15:41.868 --> 06:15:41.878 align:start position:0%
the longer you delay the process those
 
06:15:44.330 --> 06:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
costs get stuck back to the homeowner or
 
06:15:46.730 --> 06:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
the buyer and they make what might be
 
06:15:49.310 --> 06:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
affordable unaffordable if you can get
 
06:15:51.770 --> 06:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
into a process do your engineering
 
06:15:54.410 --> 06:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
present it to an informed tribunal and
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
get out many of these contracts for
 
06:15:59.448 --> 06:15:59.458 align:start position:0%
these housing projects they're subject
 
06:16:01.850 --> 06:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
to approvals and usually you have six
 
06:16:04.490 --> 06:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
months maybe a year to get it done you
 
06:16:06.288 --> 06:16:06.298 align:start position:0%
can't get out of the Superior Court in a
 
06:16:08.750 --> 06:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
year right now if I file today I might
 
06:16:10.970 --> 06:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
get a structuring conference and 90 or
 
06:16:13.788 --> 06:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
120 days and that's what the statutory
 
06:16:16.730 --> 06:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
priority already please don't change the
 
06:16:19.610 --> 06:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board love to see it
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
made better and to have some other
 
06:16:23.810 --> 06:16:23.820 align:start position:0%
Statewide resources so that we can build
 
06:16:26.890 --> 06:16:26.900 align:start position:0%
the housing we need thanks
 
06:16:29.030 --> 06:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
06:16:31.010 --> 06:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
 
06:16:31.020 --> 06:16:35.030 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for attorney
Cronin

06:16:35.030 --> 06:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:37.368 --> 06:16:37.378 align:start position:0%
none thank you thank you thank you for
 
06:16:38.510 --> 06:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
coming today
 
06:16:41.690 --> 06:16:41.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to testify
 
06:16:46.250 --> 06:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:47.990 --> 06:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
and Mr crony need to submit your card
 
06:16:51.110 --> 06:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
before you before you leave okay
 
06:16:52.850 --> 06:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a card for
 
06:16:55.010 --> 06:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
you which I'll submit my name is Ari
 
06:16:56.208 --> 06:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
Pollock I'm an attorney with the
 
06:16:58.310 --> 06:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
Gallagher Ferb in Concord I'm also a
 
06:16:59.570 --> 06:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
registered lobbyist for the New
 
06:17:01.310 --> 06:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Home Builders and we're here
 
06:17:02.930 --> 06:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
in opposition to the bill and to the
 
06:17:05.690 --> 06:17:05.700 align:start position:0%
repeal we simply want to add our voice
 
06:17:07.368 --> 06:17:07.378 align:start position:0%
to the chorus you've heard today from
 
06:17:09.470 --> 06:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
some pretty impressive folks who have
 
06:17:11.750 --> 06:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
worked on this subject matter for
 
06:17:13.910 --> 06:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
several years now the home builders are
 
06:17:15.650 --> 06:17:15.660 align:start position:0%
certainly an involved stakeholder and
 
06:17:17.628 --> 06:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
feel similarly to the others that have
 
06:17:20.868 --> 06:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
testified today I think it was almost a
 
06:17:23.150 --> 06:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
year ago exactly that I testified in
 
06:17:25.610 --> 06:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
opposition to a prior repeal Bill all
 
06:17:27.708 --> 06:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
the reasons remain the same the housing
 
06:17:29.270 --> 06:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
appeals board serves an important
 
06:17:31.730 --> 06:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
function it serves an efficient function
 
06:17:34.010 --> 06:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
and it serves a subject matter expertise
 
06:17:36.110 --> 06:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
function all of which are difficult to
 
06:17:38.930 --> 06:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
find in Superior Court if this bill were
 
06:17:40.910 --> 06:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
to pass and the housing appeals board
 
06:17:43.190 --> 06:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
were to be repealed all these cases
 
06:17:45.170 --> 06:17:45.180 align:start position:0%
would simply go to an already overworked
 
06:17:47.690 --> 06:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
Superior Court they won't disappear and
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
so I would ask you when considering the
 
06:17:51.830 --> 06:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and the potential savings
 
06:17:54.048 --> 06:17:54.058 align:start position:0%
it's simply going to be redeployment of
 
06:17:56.208 --> 06:17:56.218 align:start position:0%
that money in other places there's no
 
06:17:57.770 --> 06:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
savings to be had there's a question of
 
06:17:59.510 --> 06:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not you can obtain more
 
06:18:01.730 --> 06:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
efficient Justice in another area that
 
06:18:03.350 --> 06:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
would address the housing crisis that
 
06:18:05.208 --> 06:18:05.218 align:start position:0%
the state faces thanks very much for
 
06:18:05.218 --> 06:18:06.650 align:start position:0%
the state faces thanks very much for
listening

06:18:06.650 --> 06:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
listening
 
06:18:09.048 --> 06:18:09.058 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
06:18:13.730 --> 06:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:15.650 --> 06:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you my pleasure thank
 
06:18:15.660 --> 06:18:16.610 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you my pleasure thank
you

06:18:16.610 --> 06:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:18:30.048 --> 06:18:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:32.510 --> 06:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Alan
 
06:18:34.970 --> 06:18:34.980 align:start position:0%
Carpenter from Windham New Hampshire I
 
06:18:38.270 --> 06:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
represent myself this afternoon from a
 
06:18:40.368 --> 06:18:40.378 align:start position:0%
qualifications I'm a multi-term member
 
06:18:41.810 --> 06:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
and chair of the Wyndham planning board
 
06:18:44.090 --> 06:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
and the board of Selectmen over the last
 
06:18:46.670 --> 06:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
25 years and I served for a half a dozen
 
06:18:47.990 --> 06:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
years on the Rockingham Planning
 
06:18:48.000 --> 06:18:49.010 align:start position:0%
years on the Rockingham Planning
Commission

06:18:49.010 --> 06:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
06:18:51.170 --> 06:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm a bit of a minority I'm
 
06:18:52.788 --> 06:18:52.798 align:start position:0%
asking you to support and move forward
 
06:18:54.288 --> 06:18:54.298 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
06:18:56.750 --> 06:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
and after listening to everyone prior to
 
06:18:59.390 --> 06:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
me I'll take two different perspectives
 
06:19:01.788 --> 06:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
and I can be very brief want it more of
 
06:19:04.010 --> 06:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
a twenty thousand foot View and the
 
06:19:07.070 --> 06:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
other aboard a 2 000 foot view the 20
 
06:19:09.350 --> 06:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
000 foot view is simple I know we're not
 
06:19:11.208 --> 06:19:11.218 align:start position:0%
as red as we used to be
 
06:19:13.250 --> 06:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to think we are still New
 
06:19:13.260 --> 06:19:14.570 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to think we are still New
Hampshire

06:19:14.570 --> 06:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:19:16.548 --> 06:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
and I know in the 21st century Live Free
 
06:19:18.110 --> 06:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
or Die maybe doesn't carry the same
 
06:19:20.570 --> 06:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
moniker that it did 200 years ago
 
06:19:23.270 --> 06:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
but we're still about communities having
 
06:19:26.330 --> 06:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
control over their own land use running
 
06:19:29.230 --> 06:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
their own municipalities with as little
 
06:19:31.548 --> 06:19:31.558 align:start position:0%
interference from other governments as
 
06:19:31.558 --> 06:19:32.690 align:start position:0%
interference from other governments as
possible

06:19:32.690 --> 06:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:19:34.730 --> 06:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
and this housing appeals board in its
 
06:19:37.128 --> 06:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
short-lived history is the antithesis of
 
06:19:40.310 --> 06:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
that this is more of a an excuse the
 
06:19:42.110 --> 06:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
term but a New Jersey or New York or
 
06:19:44.750 --> 06:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts type structure in my view
 
06:19:47.750 --> 06:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
than it is a New Hampshire item
 
06:19:50.448 --> 06:19:50.458 align:start position:0%
we pass our ordinances in town
 
06:19:52.548 --> 06:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
we present them to the voters they vote
 
06:19:54.530 --> 06:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
on them they pass them and we as a
 
06:19:57.048 --> 06:19:57.058 align:start position:0%
planning board execute them we've seen
 
06:19:59.090 --> 06:19:59.100 align:start position:0%
decisions come back from the hab not
 
06:20:00.530 --> 06:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
because we didn't understand our
 
06:20:02.208 --> 06:20:02.218 align:start position:0%
ordinances and I'll get to that in a
 
06:20:05.830 --> 06:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
second but frankly because of a very
 
06:20:08.628 --> 06:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
myopic and very excuse the term but
 
06:20:10.368 --> 06:20:10.378 align:start position:0%
biased view as we've heard they're
 
06:20:12.170 --> 06:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
developers they're lawyers who make
 
06:20:13.670 --> 06:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
their livings from developers they have
 
06:20:18.288 --> 06:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
a very land owners rights perspective
 
06:20:20.090 --> 06:20:20.100 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying that's a bad thing
 
06:20:23.330 --> 06:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
but again I think philosophically the
 
06:20:25.850 --> 06:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
legislature has to decide do you want to
 
06:20:27.708 --> 06:20:27.718 align:start position:0%
do our zoning from Concord or do you
 
06:20:29.628 --> 06:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
want to let the communities decide how
 
06:20:32.030 --> 06:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
do we evolve and develop their towns
 
06:20:34.670 --> 06:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
because to date what we've seen from the
 
06:20:37.368 --> 06:20:37.378 align:start position:0%
hab and somebody mentioned the 13 to 2 I
 
06:20:40.250 --> 06:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
think that really just says it all is is
 
06:20:42.288 --> 06:20:42.298 align:start position:0%
not something that's adding any value to
 
06:20:44.570 --> 06:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
the communities now I was also not aware
 
06:20:45.650 --> 06:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the previous
 
06:20:45.660 --> 06:20:46.788 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for the previous
testimony

06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:20:48.650 --> 06:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
that really this isn't about the housing
 
06:20:50.208 --> 06:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
appeals board this is about Workforce
 
06:20:50.218 --> 06:20:51.890 align:start position:0%
appeals board this is about Workforce
housing

06:20:51.890 --> 06:20:51.900 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:20:53.330 --> 06:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I would submit to you as one who's
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
lived with Workforce housing since it
 
06:20:58.070 --> 06:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
was passed here in Concord that it's a
 
06:20:58.080 --> 06:20:59.628 align:start position:0%
was passed here in Concord that it's a
well-intentioned

06:20:59.628 --> 06:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
06:21:03.470 --> 06:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
but significantly flawed RSA
 
06:21:05.390 --> 06:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
and I think that's evidence by all these
 
06:21:07.310 --> 06:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
appeals coming in around Workforce
 
06:21:09.410 --> 06:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
housing if Workforce housing is broke
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
let's fix it
 
06:21:13.788 --> 06:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
let's not add a bureaucratic layer in
 
06:21:14.750 --> 06:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
the middle
 
06:21:17.570 --> 06:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
of our representative voters and our
 
06:21:20.270 --> 06:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary trying to fix a problem that
 
06:21:22.190 --> 06:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
we actually created let's fix the
 
06:21:22.200 --> 06:21:23.510 align:start position:0%
we actually created let's fix the
problem

06:21:23.510 --> 06:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you as a planning board
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
member we don't struggle to interpret
 
06:21:27.948 --> 06:21:27.958 align:start position:0%
our ordinances they're very clear to us
 
06:21:30.048 --> 06:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
we wrote them in many cases
 
06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
we do struggle interpreting the RSA
 
06:21:34.430 --> 06:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
around Workforce housing in the
 
06:21:37.730 --> 06:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
vagueness of it in many areas I fully
 
06:21:40.010 --> 06:21:40.020 align:start position:0%
support and I'm on record in my planning
 
06:21:41.990 --> 06:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
board meetings in saying that we need
 
06:21:43.788 --> 06:21:43.798 align:start position:0%
and certainly windham's a prime example
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
of this we need diversity in our housing
 
06:21:45.718 --> 06:21:47.150 align:start position:0%
of this we need diversity in our housing
stock

06:21:47.150 --> 06:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
stock
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
but the current ordinance doesn't allow
 
06:21:51.170 --> 06:21:51.180 align:start position:0%
us to do that
 
06:21:53.208 --> 06:21:53.218 align:start position:0%
as clearly and concisely as we would
 
06:21:55.250 --> 06:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
like to in many cases so I think there's
 
06:21:56.868 --> 06:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
opportunity there and that that's where
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
your efforts would be best spent not
 
06:22:01.850 --> 06:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
creating this third level of bureaucracy
 
06:22:05.448 --> 06:22:05.458 align:start position:0%
in between you know the net Ned is
 
06:22:07.430 --> 06:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
in the last 250 years we seem to get by
 
06:22:09.470 --> 06:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
pretty well without the hab
 
06:22:11.090 --> 06:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
I know some folks talked about the
 
06:22:11.100 --> 06:22:12.410 align:start position:0%
I know some folks talked about the
expediency

06:22:12.410 --> 06:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
expediency
 
06:22:15.350 --> 06:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
and I understand I've built for profit
 
06:22:17.390 --> 06:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
in my own past I understand the idea of
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
time is money and to a developer that's
 
06:22:20.448 --> 06:22:20.458 align:start position:0%
important I will tell you to your
 
06:22:20.458 --> 06:22:21.650 align:start position:0%
important I will tell you to your
communities

06:22:21.650 --> 06:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
communities
 
06:22:24.650 --> 06:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
speed is not necessarily a friend we're
 
06:22:26.868 --> 06:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
much more interested in a well thought
 
06:22:30.110 --> 06:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
out well-constructed decision that
 
06:22:32.510 --> 06:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
reflects the will of the voters in our
 
06:22:34.730 --> 06:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
community and is good for the community
 
06:22:37.250 --> 06:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
then we are getting a fast decision
 
06:22:39.310 --> 06:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
and so far what we've seen from the hav
 
06:22:41.448 --> 06:22:41.458 align:start position:0%
is expedient
 
06:22:43.070 --> 06:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not necessarily as well
 
06:22:44.930 --> 06:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
constructed that would allow us at least
 
06:22:46.910 --> 06:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
to move forward so I thank you for
 
06:22:48.948 --> 06:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
listening today and I appreciate on I'm
 
06:22:50.690 --> 06:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
sure I don't really have any questions
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
but should I
 
06:22:56.208 --> 06:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions for Mr Carpenter oh
 
06:22:56.218 --> 06:22:57.410 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions for Mr Carpenter oh
excellent

06:22:57.410 --> 06:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
06:23:00.170 --> 06:23:00.180 align:start position:0%
yes representative Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
06:23:02.990 --> 06:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr Carpenter I
 
06:23:05.208 --> 06:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
just have a short question and I wanted
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
to know what you meant by New Hampshire
 
06:23:12.590 --> 06:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:15.170 --> 06:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
well the the monikers of red versus blue
 
06:23:17.570 --> 06:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
we have a 100 Year history of being a
 
06:23:19.430 --> 06:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
very Republican state and today we are
 
06:23:22.368 --> 06:23:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:24.890 --> 06:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
furthermore I wanted to know
 
06:23:26.868 --> 06:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
what you meant when you said that New
 
06:23:30.530 --> 06:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not New Jersey or New York
 
06:23:33.110 --> 06:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
or Massachusetts or Connecticut well
 
06:23:34.190 --> 06:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
I've lived in New York and New Jersey
 
06:23:36.770 --> 06:23:36.780 align:start position:0%
for decades of my life and they're the
 
06:23:39.048 --> 06:23:39.058 align:start position:0%
everything from land use frankly up
 
06:23:42.048 --> 06:23:42.058 align:start position:0%
through was legislated very uh
 
06:23:45.128 --> 06:23:45.138 align:start position:0%
distinctly from Trenton and from Albany
 
06:23:47.390 --> 06:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
the local communities had very little
 
06:23:49.190 --> 06:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
control over most aspects of their
 
06:23:51.650 --> 06:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
communities lives I've been in New
 
06:23:53.448 --> 06:23:53.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now for 20
 
06:23:56.208 --> 06:23:56.218 align:start position:0%
four years and have enjoyed it being
 
06:23:59.570 --> 06:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
just the opposite where Concord sits up
 
06:24:01.368 --> 06:24:01.378 align:start position:0%
here and does a lot of great things for
 
06:24:03.230 --> 06:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
the the communities but that we
 
06:24:06.110 --> 06:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
basically get to run our own show if I
 
06:24:08.930 --> 06:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
may be so casual
 
06:24:12.470 --> 06:24:12.480 align:start position:0%

testimony on House Bill 1216 and I'll
 
06:24:31.788 --> 06:24:31.798 align:start position:0%

huh
 
06:24:45.410 --> 06:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
if uh if we could just have five minutes
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
till half past and that will give
 
06:24:49.910 --> 06:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
everybody an opportunity just to have a
 
06:24:51.530 --> 06:24:51.540 align:start position:0%

meeting to get through at home and I'd
 
06:26:33.948 --> 06:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting you know for the
 
06:26:35.628 --> 06:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
hearing you go 10 minutes and then go
 
06:26:38.090 --> 06:26:38.100 align:start position:0%

06:33:00.410 --> 06:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman I am
 
06:33:01.970 --> 06:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
Casey Conway state representative from
 
06:33:04.250 --> 06:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
Dover representing Stratford County
 
06:33:06.170 --> 06:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
District 13. it's a district that is
 
06:33:08.750 --> 06:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
primarily rental housing
 
06:33:12.230 --> 06:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
this version you have today HB 1200 is
 
06:33:14.990 --> 06:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
sort of a modified simpler clearer
 
06:33:17.750 --> 06:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
version of a rent notification bill that
 
06:33:19.070 --> 06:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
you have seen
 
06:33:21.730 --> 06:33:21.740 align:start position:0%
I guess the last two years
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
so what this would do is require
 
06:33:26.628 --> 06:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
landlords to provide 45 days notice for
 
06:33:29.090 --> 06:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
an increase in rent the current
 
06:33:31.430 --> 06:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirement is 30 days and for some
 
06:33:33.530 --> 06:33:33.540 align:start position:0%
context that's the same standard already
 
06:33:36.170 --> 06:33:36.180 align:start position:0%
used in Maine and it's 15 days fewer
 
06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
than is required in Vermont
 
06:33:41.090 --> 06:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
the community excuse me the committee
 
06:33:42.770 --> 06:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
has heard it before but the housing
 
06:33:44.270 --> 06:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
crisis in the state is real and it's
 
06:33:46.910 --> 06:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
gotten worse during the pandemic rents
 
06:33:48.530 --> 06:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
have increased faster than inflation in
 
06:33:50.208 --> 06:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
every county in the state the average
 
06:33:52.610 --> 06:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment now costs fifteen
 
06:33:54.288 --> 06:33:54.298 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
06:33:56.208 --> 06:33:56.218 align:start position:0%
and just for contacts the first time I
 
06:33:57.890 --> 06:33:57.900 align:start position:0%
came before this committee the average
 
06:33:59.510 --> 06:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
two bedroom was about twelve hundred and
 
06:34:02.510 --> 06:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars so that's two years ago
 
06:34:02.520 --> 06:34:04.850 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars so that's two years ago
um

06:34:04.850 --> 06:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:07.368 --> 06:34:07.378 align:start position:0%
in Dover uh just as contacts fifteen
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars would get you I think
 
06:34:11.628 --> 06:34:11.638 align:start position:0%
zero two-bedroom apartments so it's uh
 
06:34:13.128 --> 06:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
it's substantially higher in some parts
 
06:34:14.208 --> 06:34:14.218 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
06:34:16.070 --> 06:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate is less than one
 
06:34:18.170 --> 06:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
percent it's as low as half a percent or
 
06:34:19.250 --> 06:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
even lower
 
06:34:21.110 --> 06:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
there just aren't many rentals available
 
06:34:24.410 --> 06:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:26.510 --> 06:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
the net effect of this Dynamic is that
 
06:34:27.708 --> 06:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
someone who's priced out of one
 
06:34:27.718 --> 06:34:29.390 align:start position:0%
someone who's priced out of one
apartment

06:34:29.390 --> 06:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
06:34:30.948 --> 06:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
cannot necessarily find another
 
06:34:34.368 --> 06:34:34.378 align:start position:0%
apartment nearby in the same town in the
 
06:34:36.650 --> 06:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
same city and certainly not expect to
 
06:34:38.570 --> 06:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
find it in the same neighborhood
 
06:34:40.910 --> 06:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
so the ramification of that is uh you
 
06:34:42.590 --> 06:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
could have to change jobs you might not
 
06:34:44.448 --> 06:34:44.458 align:start position:0%
have access to Transportation your kids
 
06:34:45.948 --> 06:34:45.958 align:start position:0%
could need a new school district you
 
06:34:48.650 --> 06:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
might lose access to child care it's not
 
06:34:52.670 --> 06:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
just moving from one place to another
 
06:34:55.010 --> 06:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
and furthermore
 
06:34:56.270 --> 06:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in a state with an
 
06:34:58.490 --> 06:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
employment crisis if somebody
 
06:35:01.310 --> 06:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
is forced to move out of state we've
 
06:35:02.868 --> 06:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
lost not only a resident we've lost
 
06:35:05.510 --> 06:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably a worker who
 
06:35:08.230 --> 06:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
may not come back so
 
06:35:10.430 --> 06:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know and just as a point of context
 
06:35:13.010 --> 06:35:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is not an anti-landlord Bill we had
 
06:35:15.770 --> 06:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
the I guess the pleasure and displeasure
 
06:35:17.448 --> 06:35:17.458 align:start position:0%
of becoming landlords this summer we
 
06:35:19.910 --> 06:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
rented our house out for four months so
 
06:35:22.510 --> 06:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
we saw the extreme interest
 
06:35:25.368 --> 06:35:25.378 align:start position:0%
overwhelming interest in the home and
 
06:35:27.650 --> 06:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
then we saw the problem that many
 
06:35:30.048 --> 06:35:30.058 align:start position:0%
landlords Encounter of our tenants
 
06:35:32.628 --> 06:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
skipping Out On A month's rent we also
 
06:35:33.770 --> 06:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of what
 
06:35:36.170 --> 06:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
normal wear and tear looks like so this
 
06:35:38.270 --> 06:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
is not an anti-landlord bill
 
06:35:40.310 --> 06:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
fully understand where they're coming
 
06:35:42.890 --> 06:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
from and have a new perspective on that
 
06:35:42.900 --> 06:35:43.610 align:start position:0%
from and have a new perspective on that
um

06:35:43.610 --> 06:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:45.230 --> 06:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
but landlords already do this they
 
06:35:47.448 --> 06:35:47.458 align:start position:0%
already give their tenants notice of
 
06:35:50.030 --> 06:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
higher rent this would accelerate that
 
06:35:52.548 --> 06:35:52.558 align:start position:0%
process by 15 days so it's something
 
06:35:54.288 --> 06:35:54.298 align:start position:0%
they already do something they're
 
06:35:56.510 --> 06:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
familiar doing and it's as simple as
 
06:35:58.548 --> 06:35:58.558 align:start position:0%
sending an email
 
06:35:58.558 --> 06:36:00.048 align:start position:0%
sending an email
so

06:36:00.048 --> 06:36:00.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:01.910 --> 06:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
um under this you know this legislature
 
06:36:03.470 --> 06:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
under both parties has really struggled
 
06:36:06.470 --> 06:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
with how to address the housing crisis
 
06:36:09.770 --> 06:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
in the state it happened last term uh
 
06:36:11.330 --> 06:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
it's happened this term there's just no
 
06:36:13.250 --> 06:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
easy way to do it
 
06:36:15.470 --> 06:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
um this isn't a Panacea this isn't going
 
06:36:17.030 --> 06:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
to solve it but I think this will take
 
06:36:18.948 --> 06:36:18.958 align:start position:0%
some of the pressure off give tenants
 
06:36:21.470 --> 06:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
who are priced out forced to move for
 
06:36:23.150 --> 06:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
any number of reasons they're they're
 
06:36:25.010 --> 06:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
building sold
 
06:36:26.868 --> 06:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
um their landlord decided to renovate
 
06:36:28.610 --> 06:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
any number of reasons somebody is forced
 
06:36:29.750 --> 06:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
to move this would give them a little
 
06:36:31.190 --> 06:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
bit of extra time to find replacement
 
06:36:33.548 --> 06:36:33.558 align:start position:0%
housing ideally in their same Community
 
06:36:37.250 --> 06:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
but hopefully uh not too far off
 
06:36:40.730 --> 06:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
so uh with that I'll I'll stop
 
06:36:44.090 --> 06:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to take questions
 
06:36:46.330 --> 06:36:46.340 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
06:36:48.770 --> 06:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo make a mistake
 
06:36:48.780 --> 06:36:49.548 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo make a mistake
yeah

06:36:49.548 --> 06:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:36:51.650 --> 06:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative Conley
 
06:36:53.930 --> 06:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
really quick question
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that sending the 45-day
 
06:36:59.150 --> 06:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
notice of a rent increase is as simple
 
06:37:01.910 --> 06:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
as sending an email
 
06:37:05.690 --> 06:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I agree but not everyone has email so
 
06:37:07.190 --> 06:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
you would really need to back that up
 
06:37:08.510 --> 06:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
with a paper
 
06:37:08.520 --> 06:37:09.770 align:start position:0%
with a paper
correct

06:37:09.770 --> 06:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
06:37:11.510 --> 06:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the
 
06:37:11.520 --> 06:37:13.250 align:start position:0%
thank you representative the
notification

06:37:13.250 --> 06:37:13.260 align:start position:0%
notification
 
06:37:15.890 --> 06:37:15.900 align:start position:0%
um could happen in more than one more
 
06:37:17.570 --> 06:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
than one mode could be email could be
 
06:37:20.208 --> 06:37:20.218 align:start position:0%
mail could be something as simple as
 
06:37:21.770 --> 06:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
placing a piece of paper in your
 
06:37:23.448 --> 06:37:23.458 align:start position:0%
tenant's mailbox
 
06:37:26.030 --> 06:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
or any we can all contemplate any number
 
06:37:35.930 --> 06:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:37.548 --> 06:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow up on that I
 
06:37:40.010 --> 06:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
think that it says here that it shall be
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
served in accordance with the provisions
 
06:37:45.590 --> 06:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:47.448 --> 06:37:47.458 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you the point of
 
06:37:50.150 --> 06:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
saying the email was not that uh to be
 
06:37:52.250 --> 06:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
blithe or casual it was meant that the
 
06:37:55.610 --> 06:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
notification with uh
 
06:37:57.590 --> 06:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
with you know a new lease or something
 
06:37:59.448 --> 06:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
of those name of that nature could be
 
06:38:01.368 --> 06:38:01.378 align:start position:0%
done in that form it wouldn't have to be
 
06:38:07.490 --> 06:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:11.628 --> 06:38:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:13.430 --> 06:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:38:14.930 --> 06:38:14.940 align:start position:0%
and to the committee I have to leave to
 
06:38:16.310 --> 06:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
go to my other to go back to my
 
06:38:18.650 --> 06:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee but no that's why I'm rushing
 
06:38:22.730 --> 06:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:26.208 --> 06:38:26.218 align:start position:0%
uh representative Perez asked for three
 
06:38:26.218 --> 06:38:39.970 align:start position:0%
uh representative Perez asked for three
minutes

06:38:39.970 --> 06:38:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:43.970 --> 06:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Maria Perez
 
06:38:46.010 --> 06:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
um is the representative for district 23
 
06:38:48.890 --> 06:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
Milford New Hampshire I'm here in
 
06:38:51.410 --> 06:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
support of hb12 and I'm one of the
 
06:38:53.690 --> 06:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill
 
06:38:56.708 --> 06:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
um what we're seeing right now we did a
 
06:38:59.090 --> 06:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
situation that people having a hard time
 
06:39:01.548 --> 06:39:01.558 align:start position:0%
finding uh
 
06:39:04.368 --> 06:39:04.378 align:start position:0%
place to live in there are the amount of
 
06:39:05.690 --> 06:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
money that it has to pay for the
 
06:39:07.788 --> 06:39:07.798 align:start position:0%
apartments are this is I think it is
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
critical for landlords to send a
 
06:39:14.150 --> 06:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
notification 45 days before they uh they
 
06:39:16.610 --> 06:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
uh do any changes to the rent
 
06:39:19.670 --> 06:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
um that will help people to decide if
 
06:39:21.650 --> 06:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
something that they're going to be able
 
06:39:23.868 --> 06:39:23.878 align:start position:0%
to afford that's something that it has
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
to move out of their uh area or they you
 
06:39:27.830 --> 06:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
know like how hopefully they can find
 
06:39:30.708 --> 06:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
out an apartment in their same location
 
06:39:33.470 --> 06:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
but it is critical for people to have
 
06:39:36.110 --> 06:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
enough time to decide those type of
 
06:39:38.270 --> 06:39:38.280 align:start position:0%
things especially with the economy that
 
06:39:40.250 --> 06:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have right now people they're having
 
06:39:43.910 --> 06:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
a hard time even um even in my town uh
 
06:39:46.730 --> 06:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
the two-bedroom apartment is 1600
 
06:39:49.190 --> 06:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
um for two bathrooms and most of them
 
06:39:51.530 --> 06:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
they go from eighteen hundred dollars or
 
06:39:55.368 --> 06:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
up and and I think this is not in
 
06:39:57.708 --> 06:39:57.718 align:start position:0%
anti-landlaw like someone else say you
 
06:40:01.310 --> 06:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
know I I work for the rental property
 
06:40:04.850 --> 06:40:04.860 align:start position:0%
management in Manchester previously and
 
06:40:06.770 --> 06:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
and I understand you know the landlords
 
06:40:08.810 --> 06:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
that you know they they already get the
 
06:40:10.610 --> 06:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
notice but I think it's critical for
 
06:40:13.368 --> 06:40:13.378 align:start position:0%
them for um for the people who rent the
 
06:40:14.750 --> 06:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
apartments to have enough time to make
 
06:40:16.310 --> 06:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
the decision that they can afford at the
 
06:40:16.320 --> 06:40:20.270 align:start position:0%
the decision that they can afford at the
apartment

06:40:20.270 --> 06:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:24.530 --> 06:40:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:26.208 --> 06:40:26.218 align:start position:0%
see none thank you for your testimony
 
06:40:27.708 --> 06:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:31.010 --> 06:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative Nicole Klein Knight
 
06:40:38.810 --> 06:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:45.128 --> 06:40:45.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:46.910 --> 06:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:40:48.770 --> 06:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
again for the opportunity to speak
 
06:40:51.288 --> 06:40:51.298 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
06:40:54.230 --> 06:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
so again being an advocate for landlords
 
06:40:57.708 --> 06:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
across the state of New Hampshire
 
06:40:59.930 --> 06:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns that we have with
 
06:41:02.930 --> 06:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
bills like this is they're what we would
 
06:41:06.350 --> 06:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
call Band-Aid bills and
 
06:41:09.230 --> 06:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
is unquestionable that we have
 
06:41:11.390 --> 06:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
an issue with the affordability of
 
06:41:11.400 --> 06:41:12.410 align:start position:0%
an issue with the affordability of
housing

06:41:12.410 --> 06:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
housing
 
06:41:15.110 --> 06:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
we would like to see the affordability
 
06:41:17.270 --> 06:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
of housing addressed in a way that
 
06:41:19.010 --> 06:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
actually works and creates more
 
06:41:20.810 --> 06:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
06:41:23.930 --> 06:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
many of the bills like this will worsen
 
06:41:25.430 --> 06:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
06:41:27.350 --> 06:41:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's an immediate
 
06:41:29.330 --> 06:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
it looks like an immediate little fix
 
06:41:32.448 --> 06:41:32.458 align:start position:0%
but it always backfires into
 
06:41:36.830 --> 06:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
increased rents and complications so
 
06:41:40.490 --> 06:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
just consider if a
 
06:41:44.208 --> 06:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
rent increases 45 days
 
06:41:46.850 --> 06:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
from the landlord to the tenant but the
 
06:41:48.708 --> 06:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
tenant's notice to the landlord is 30
 
06:41:48.718 --> 06:41:50.628 align:start position:0%
tenant's notice to the landlord is 30
days

06:41:50.628 --> 06:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
days
 
06:41:53.090 --> 06:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
then the tenant starts looking 45 days
 
06:41:53.100 --> 06:41:54.110 align:start position:0%
then the tenant starts looking 45 days
out

06:41:54.110 --> 06:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:41:56.390 --> 06:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
but on average they're finding things
 
06:41:59.150 --> 06:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
that are not available until
 
06:42:01.490 --> 06:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
you know 30 30 days
 
06:42:04.610 --> 06:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
it creates an imbalance in the notice
 
06:42:08.868 --> 06:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
it forces a worsening of the demand for
 
06:42:11.090 --> 06:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
housing because they're going out to
 
06:42:13.070 --> 06:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
look but the housing is not available
 
06:42:18.170 --> 06:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:20.930 --> 06:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
06:42:23.868 --> 06:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
45 days there's a percentage of tenants
 
06:42:26.510 --> 06:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that just stop paying their rent
 
06:42:29.390 --> 06:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
those are the Bad actors of course
 
06:42:32.750 --> 06:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
but if it's 45 days now that unpaid rent
 
06:42:36.230 --> 06:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:38.330 --> 06:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
that two-month loss has to be made up
 
06:42:38.340 --> 06:42:40.250 align:start position:0%
that two-month loss has to be made up
somehow

06:42:40.250 --> 06:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
06:42:42.230 --> 06:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
of course that's going to be increased
 
06:42:42.240 --> 06:42:43.788 align:start position:0%
of course that's going to be increased
rents

06:42:43.788 --> 06:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
rents
 
06:42:46.430 --> 06:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
two months loss is 16 percent
 
06:42:50.150 --> 06:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:54.470 --> 06:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
any time you create more restriction
 
06:42:57.530 --> 06:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
it always comes back eventually in
 
06:43:00.288 --> 06:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
increased rents
 
06:43:02.930 --> 06:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
we need to fix affordable housing
 
06:43:06.410 --> 06:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
what we need is more housing
 
06:43:08.868 --> 06:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
we need to not be doing this little
 
06:43:10.190 --> 06:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
thing and that little thing and that
 
06:43:12.830 --> 06:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
little thing that just imbalances the
 
06:43:14.448 --> 06:43:14.458 align:start position:0%
laws and makes things worse and
 
06:43:16.190 --> 06:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
increases rents we need to fix
 
06:43:18.830 --> 06:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing like really we need
 
06:43:20.990 --> 06:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
to create more housing that's where our
 
06:43:22.490 --> 06:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
focus should be
 
06:43:26.690 --> 06:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
not in little little bills like this
 
06:43:31.368 --> 06:43:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:33.288 --> 06:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
06:43:35.810 --> 06:43:35.820 align:start position:0%
you may think it's small but this is the
 
06:43:38.208 --> 06:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
foot in the door to regulating rents and
 
06:43:41.090 --> 06:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:44.030 --> 06:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
and that that's always been a bad idea
 
06:43:47.030 --> 06:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
proven out over and over and over and
 
06:43:47.040 --> 06:43:48.650 align:start position:0%
proven out over and over and over and
over

06:43:48.650 --> 06:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
over
 
06:43:50.750 --> 06:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
so I'd be really happy to take any
 
06:43:56.448 --> 06:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia
 
06:44:00.350 --> 06:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr Norman
 
06:44:02.690 --> 06:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
for taking my question thank you
 
06:44:07.788 --> 06:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
it's January 12th so if I were to
 
06:44:10.190 --> 06:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
go looking for an apartment today
 
06:44:13.788 --> 06:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
I would find one that I like I apply for
 
06:44:13.798 --> 06:44:14.708 align:start position:0%
I would find one that I like I apply for
it

06:44:14.708 --> 06:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:44:17.868 --> 06:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
the landlord would have perhaps a
 
06:44:20.448 --> 06:44:20.458 align:start position:0%
hundred other applicants
 
06:44:22.910 --> 06:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
is that landlord going to hold that
 
06:44:25.190 --> 06:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
apartment for me until
 
06:44:26.628 --> 06:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
March 1st
 
06:44:28.670 --> 06:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
not in the slightest way that's actually
 
06:44:31.368 --> 06:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
on my page and going fast I skip over
 
06:44:33.350 --> 06:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
things but yes that's that's absolutely
 
06:44:35.510 --> 06:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
true no landlord is going to be holding
 
06:44:37.730 --> 06:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
an apartment vacant
 
06:44:39.948 --> 06:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
for an increasing amount of time like
 
06:44:41.868 --> 06:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
the department the landlord's not going
 
06:44:44.810 --> 06:44:44.820 align:start position:0%
to hold the apartment vacant for 45 days
 
06:44:50.628 --> 06:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:50.638 --> 06:44:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
May

06:44:52.070 --> 06:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
May
 
06:44:52.080 --> 06:44:54.948 align:start position:0%
May
so

06:44:54.948 --> 06:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:57.110 --> 06:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
if I really wanted that apartment I
 
06:45:01.070 --> 06:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
might have to pay for February's rent to
 
06:45:03.350 --> 06:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
have it held for me and that would hold
 
06:45:05.270 --> 06:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
an apartment vacant
 
06:45:05.280 --> 06:45:06.410 align:start position:0%
an apartment vacant
for

06:45:06.410 --> 06:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:45:08.690 --> 06:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
a period of time times how many
 
06:45:11.208 --> 06:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
apartments are turning over
 
06:45:13.430 --> 06:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
that is actually happening we're seeing
 
06:45:16.610 --> 06:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
in my business people there is a large
 
06:45:19.128 --> 06:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm telling you it's true there's a
 
06:45:21.288 --> 06:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
lot of people looking for apartments
 
06:45:24.650 --> 06:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
clamoring her apartments and often
 
06:45:26.690 --> 06:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough affordable
 
06:45:29.470 --> 06:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
housing it's not that they're paying
 
06:45:31.250 --> 06:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
increased rent
 
06:45:33.708 --> 06:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
for a time they're paying double rent
 
06:45:36.530 --> 06:45:36.540 align:start position:0%
just to get the housing
 
06:45:40.250 --> 06:45:40.260 align:start position:0%
they'll pay a month's rent sometimes
 
06:45:42.590 --> 06:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
just to hold that housing so they have
 
06:45:42.600 --> 06:45:44.810 align:start position:0%
just to hold that housing so they have
it

06:45:44.810 --> 06:45:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:48.110 --> 06:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's an issue I mean really we need to
 
06:45:51.288 --> 06:45:51.298 align:start position:0%
do something that builds more housing
 
06:45:53.810 --> 06:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
to ease this issue it's all supply and
 
06:45:53.820 --> 06:45:54.948 align:start position:0%
to ease this issue it's all supply and
demand

06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
demand
 
06:45:57.410 --> 06:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
all this stuff here is like have you
 
06:45:58.610 --> 06:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
ever tried to
 
06:46:00.890 --> 06:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
put water let's say in a balloon and
 
06:46:02.690 --> 06:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
squeeze water
 
06:46:05.330 --> 06:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't squeeze it's like
 
06:46:07.610 --> 06:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
this you you do one thing to push the
 
06:46:09.590 --> 06:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
market one way and you say well that
 
06:46:11.750 --> 06:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
that'll help and pretty soon something
 
06:46:14.090 --> 06:46:14.100 align:start position:0%
pops out over here
 
06:46:17.510 --> 06:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
you can't be doing these kind of little
 
06:46:19.070 --> 06:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think like this we have to really
 
06:46:21.110 --> 06:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
affix affordable housing by creating
 
06:46:27.708 --> 06:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:29.810 --> 06:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
06:46:29.820 --> 06:46:31.250 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Horrigan

06:46:31.250 --> 06:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
Horrigan
 
06:46:31.260 --> 06:46:31.910 align:start position:0%
Horrigan
um

06:46:31.910 --> 06:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:35.270 --> 06:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I I mean I I agree
 
06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
I agreed that uh you know we have to
 
06:46:39.288 --> 06:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
create more affordable housing but my my
 
06:46:42.170 --> 06:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
question the reality of this is that um
 
06:46:43.670 --> 06:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
you can basically
 
06:46:45.708 --> 06:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
you can basically rent all of your uh
 
06:46:49.190 --> 06:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
all of your uh inventory at a very high
 
06:46:51.048 --> 06:46:51.058 align:start position:0%
price certainly very high compared to
 
06:46:53.810 --> 06:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
what people are being paid even with uh
 
06:46:55.788 --> 06:46:55.798 align:start position:0%
even with wages going up because of
 
06:46:57.230 --> 06:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the labor market
 
06:46:57.240 --> 06:46:58.788 align:start position:0%
what's happening with the labor market
so

06:46:58.788 --> 06:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:01.190 --> 06:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's a fact that the prices are so
 
06:47:04.368 --> 06:47:04.378 align:start position:0%
high and the demand is so high does that
 
06:47:08.150 --> 06:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
does that make the uh effect of uh and
 
06:47:09.288 --> 06:47:09.298 align:start position:0%
then but then you're saying then of
 
06:47:10.490 --> 06:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
course you point out and understand why
 
06:47:12.110 --> 06:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
you're pointing out that any demand we
 
06:47:14.570 --> 06:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
make in you on the landlords will raise
 
06:47:16.310 --> 06:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
their costs so is that
 
06:47:18.170 --> 06:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
worse in a situation like this where you
 
06:47:21.350 --> 06:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
have uh you know where you can you know
 
06:47:23.690 --> 06:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
basically rent out every apartment you
 
06:47:25.490 --> 06:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
have at a very high price that's like
 
06:47:27.110 --> 06:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
probably more than the average working
 
06:47:28.968 --> 06:47:28.978 align:start position:0%
person can afford is that so that
 
06:47:30.288 --> 06:47:30.298 align:start position:0%
situation where you're very high prices
 
06:47:32.628 --> 06:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
and very high demand is that
 
06:47:36.110 --> 06:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
make it better or worse when we uh
 
06:47:38.868 --> 06:47:38.878 align:start position:0%
when we impose some Demand on you that
 
06:47:42.250 --> 06:47:42.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:45.530 --> 06:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite clear every time every
 
06:47:47.868 --> 06:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
time we do something every time we
 
06:47:50.510 --> 06:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
propose something that imposes
 
06:47:52.850 --> 06:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
an extra costs on landlords and this
 
06:47:54.170 --> 06:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
seems like
 
06:47:54.180 --> 06:47:55.190 align:start position:0%
seems like
um

06:47:55.190 --> 06:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
this particular one seems like a fairly
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
low cost to me you then say we're gonna
 
06:48:00.650 --> 06:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
have to rate this will raise rents even
 
06:48:02.570 --> 06:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
higher because of the extra cost and
 
06:48:05.330 --> 06:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
that's um yeah we well you come in you
 
06:48:07.250 --> 06:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
can't and you know I I respect where
 
06:48:09.288 --> 06:48:09.298 align:start position:0%
you're coming from and occasionally you
 
06:48:10.850 --> 06:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
relent like a few years ago with the bed
 
06:48:12.410 --> 06:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
bugs you actually agreed to do something
 
06:48:16.128 --> 06:48:16.138 align:start position:0%
about it but um so it was defected these
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
higher costs these additional costs made
 
06:48:22.190 --> 06:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
is that made worse by the fact that the
 
06:48:23.628 --> 06:48:23.638 align:start position:0%
rents are so extraordinarily High
 
06:48:25.310 --> 06:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
compared to what working people can
 
06:48:27.350 --> 06:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
afford or is that uh
 
06:48:29.030 --> 06:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
or does that make it like a little bit
 
06:48:32.208 --> 06:48:32.218 align:start position:0%
less bad for you guys but still bad so
 
06:48:34.250 --> 06:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know okay I'm still unsure of
 
06:48:37.730 --> 06:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
the question but but what I would say is
 
06:48:40.190 --> 06:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
that rents are much higher than they
 
06:48:43.610 --> 06:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
were yes the the what landlords have to
 
06:48:47.208 --> 06:48:47.218 align:start position:0%
do to comply with regulations uh lead
 
06:48:49.670 --> 06:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
paint removal
 
06:48:51.890 --> 06:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
um fire codes
 
06:48:54.170 --> 06:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
increase taxes increase Insurance
 
06:48:56.510 --> 06:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
everything's going up yeah you can't buy
 
06:48:58.548 --> 06:48:58.558 align:start position:0%
a burger for the same what you did you
 
06:49:01.070 --> 06:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
know two years ago so and that's just a
 
06:49:04.430 --> 06:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
fact of reality and any time that some
 
06:49:05.530 --> 06:49:05.540 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
limitation regulation barrier is put on
 
06:49:11.868 --> 06:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
landlords then that makes landlords less
 
06:49:15.110 --> 06:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
desirable to create and offer housing is
 
06:49:18.230 --> 06:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
is not easy to be a landlord oh yeah I
 
06:49:18.240 --> 06:49:19.430 align:start position:0%
is not easy to be a landlord oh yeah I
understand

06:49:19.430 --> 06:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:49:21.350 --> 06:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
you don't want to create barriers to
 
06:49:23.570 --> 06:49:23.580 align:start position:0%
being a landlord what you want is to put
 
06:49:26.270 --> 06:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
your focus on creating more housing
 
06:49:27.890 --> 06:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm saying that not because it
 
06:49:29.750 --> 06:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
benefits me if there was more housing I
 
06:49:31.368 --> 06:49:31.378 align:start position:0%
would get less rent
 
06:49:34.128 --> 06:49:34.138 align:start position:0%
right because of supply and demand but
 
06:49:36.890 --> 06:49:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's as a society what we need that's
 
06:49:39.288 --> 06:49:39.298 align:start position:0%
where we need to put our Focus
 
06:49:41.570 --> 06:49:41.580 align:start position:0%
um can I follow up to
 
06:49:44.570 --> 06:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
but your your prices are I think you
 
06:49:45.948 --> 06:49:45.958 align:start position:0%
have to admit you're
 
06:49:47.448 --> 06:49:47.458 align:start position:0%
prices are at least from the renter's
 
06:49:48.590 --> 06:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
perspective extremely high
 
06:49:50.690 --> 06:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily high it's epic because
 
06:49:52.128 --> 06:49:52.138 align:start position:0%
you have to make them extraordinly high
 
06:49:54.110 --> 06:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
because we're posting so many costs on
 
06:49:56.390 --> 06:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
you or is it simply because there's a
 
06:49:58.968 --> 06:49:58.978 align:start position:0%
a shortage of uh that there's more
 
06:50:01.250 --> 06:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
demand than Supply and you can charge
 
06:50:03.650 --> 06:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
more because the market will bear more I
 
06:50:05.628 --> 06:50:05.638 align:start position:0%
understand that question yeah thanks so
 
06:50:08.090 --> 06:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
I finally got around
 
06:50:10.070 --> 06:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
06:50:12.590 --> 06:50:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's both yeah right there's no question
 
06:50:15.230 --> 06:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
about it that supply and demand
 
06:50:19.250 --> 06:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's just pure economics that's going to
 
06:50:22.010 --> 06:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
increase prices so if we had more Supply
 
06:50:26.810 --> 06:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
that would help to stabilize the prices
 
06:50:28.310 --> 06:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I have seen markets where the rents
 
06:50:29.948 --> 06:50:29.958 align:start position:0%
have come down by the way over the years
 
06:50:32.708 --> 06:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
and the increased regulations
 
06:50:36.350 --> 06:50:36.360 align:start position:0%
definitely adds to the costs
 
06:50:39.350 --> 06:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
for sure the lead Bill increased the
 
06:50:40.548 --> 06:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
rents a lot
 
06:50:42.708 --> 06:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
06:50:44.628 --> 06:50:44.638 align:start position:0%
what's that um yes and of course
 
06:50:46.730 --> 06:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
probably another part of it is to when
 
06:50:48.410 --> 06:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
people are playing High rents don't they
 
06:50:50.270 --> 06:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
also probably demand more so like if you
 
06:50:50.280 --> 06:50:50.930 align:start position:0%
also probably demand more so like if you
were

06:50:50.930 --> 06:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:50:52.788 --> 06:50:52.798 align:start position:0%
paying a hundred dollars a month for
 
06:50:53.990 --> 06:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
your apartment you might put up with the
 
06:50:56.570 --> 06:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
lead paint and mediator yourself or just
 
06:50:58.190 --> 06:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
live with it where if it's two thousand
 
06:50:59.990 --> 06:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
look by God you're gonna get that lead
 
06:51:02.090 --> 06:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
paint out of there and the tenants gonna
 
06:51:04.128 --> 06:51:04.138 align:start position:0%
do everything they can to get rid of it
 
06:51:06.350 --> 06:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
I agree that that's true and that's what
 
06:51:08.570 --> 06:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
we are seeing like we're needing to
 
06:51:11.690 --> 06:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
renovate more than we used to and we are
 
06:51:14.750 --> 06:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
and and we are removing the lead paint
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we're we're on a much higher
 
06:51:18.948 --> 06:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
percentage of lead beta departments than
 
06:51:21.410 --> 06:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
we used to be and that's great
 
06:51:25.368 --> 06:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
I mean in terms of my liability
 
06:51:27.350 --> 06:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks Jim
 
06:51:29.448 --> 06:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
representative di Lorenzo thank you Mr
 
06:51:31.310 --> 06:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr chairman I feel like the
 
06:51:34.548 --> 06:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
discussion is going kind of off tracks
 
06:51:36.890 --> 06:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
because what we're talking about is a
 
06:51:38.510 --> 06:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
difference in
 
06:51:40.070 --> 06:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
I noticed
 
06:51:42.288 --> 06:51:42.298 align:start position:0%
of a rent to increase going from 30 days
 
06:51:46.548 --> 06:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
to 45 days like 30 to 45 that's 15 days
 
06:51:47.930 --> 06:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
and we're
 
06:51:49.850 --> 06:51:49.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking around that right now we
 
06:51:51.468 --> 06:51:51.478 align:start position:0%
need to get back to the Germaine
 
06:51:53.628 --> 06:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
discussions thank you
 
06:51:55.670 --> 06:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:51:57.590 --> 06:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions for Mr
 
06:51:57.600 --> 06:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
is there any other questions for Mr
Norman

06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
Norman
 
06:52:02.868 --> 06:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for yourself today
 
06:52:02.878 --> 06:52:05.030 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for yourself today
representative

06:52:05.030 --> 06:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:52:07.788 --> 06:52:07.798 align:start position:0%
uh Nicole Knight Klein
 
06:52:10.030 --> 06:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
fine night excuse me
 
06:52:12.830 --> 06:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much members of this
 
06:52:14.930 --> 06:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee and Mr chairman and
 
06:52:16.910 --> 06:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Nicole Klein knight from
 
06:52:21.048 --> 06:52:21.058 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 11 in Manchester I'm
 
06:52:23.208 --> 06:52:23.218 align:start position:0%
one of the co-sponsors of this bill I
 
06:52:26.810 --> 06:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
just want to address some of the things
 
06:52:29.390 --> 06:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
that the last speaker said
 
06:52:32.810 --> 06:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
um they kept saying that there's a
 
06:52:35.890 --> 06:52:35.900 align:start position:0%
supply problem there's not enough houses
 
06:52:39.650 --> 06:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with how far you
 
06:52:42.350 --> 06:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
notify a renter that's not going to
 
06:52:44.930 --> 06:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
change unless we attack it in a
 
06:52:45.890 --> 06:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
different way
 
06:52:50.628 --> 06:52:50.638 align:start position:0%
what this does do is notify a renter
 
06:52:53.810 --> 06:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
that they can save they can start
 
06:52:55.368 --> 06:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
chipping away so they can actually
 
06:52:58.910 --> 06:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
afford if the rent is going to go up or
 
06:53:00.288 --> 06:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
if they are going to need a security
 
06:53:03.350 --> 06:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
deposit for another place to live as
 
06:53:05.990 --> 06:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sylvia pointed out you
 
06:53:08.208 --> 06:53:08.218 align:start position:0%
have a hundred people or more than that
 
06:53:11.090 --> 06:53:11.100 align:start position:0%
applying for one apartment
 
06:53:13.670 --> 06:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
the the landlord is gonna get somebody
 
06:53:17.150 --> 06:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
this does not hurt any landlords this is
 
06:53:19.368 --> 06:53:19.378 align:start position:0%
a respectful way to keep people from
 
06:53:22.070 --> 06:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
being homeless and as you know and all
 
06:53:23.468 --> 06:53:23.478 align:start position:0%
the members of this body know
 
06:53:25.190 --> 06:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
homelessness is out of control
 
06:53:27.968 --> 06:53:27.978 align:start position:0%
especially in Manchester
 
06:53:29.930 --> 06:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
this is
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
not going to be a burden financially for
 
06:53:37.730 --> 06:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
a I'm a renter and
 
06:53:37.740 --> 06:53:38.570 align:start position:0%
a I'm a renter and
um

06:53:38.570 --> 06:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:40.310 --> 06:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have really good communication
 
06:53:43.250 --> 06:53:43.260 align:start position:0%
because I'm an honest renter I pay on
 
06:53:47.448 --> 06:53:47.458 align:start position:0%
time if for instance the property taxes
 
06:53:49.788 --> 06:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
go up like they usually do because we
 
06:53:51.350 --> 06:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
don't have any other tax pull to pull
 
06:53:54.468 --> 06:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
from they will have to notify me in
 
06:53:57.350 --> 06:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
sadness they don't want to do that and
 
06:53:59.990 --> 06:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
fact many of my constituents that our
 
06:54:01.548 --> 06:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
landlords have reached out to me
 
06:54:05.150 --> 06:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
concerned about the property tax and how
 
06:54:06.890 --> 06:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's going to impact them how they
 
06:54:08.570 --> 06:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
aren't making any money off the current
 
06:54:10.730 --> 06:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
situation and how they're going to have
 
06:54:14.090 --> 06:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
to increase rent this at least a bare
 
06:54:16.968 --> 06:54:16.978 align:start position:0%
minimum gives people a fighting chance
 
06:54:20.750 --> 06:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
to stay off of the street and I want to
 
06:54:22.788 --> 06:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
point out that the median income in
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
Manchester is thirty two thousand
 
06:54:27.770 --> 06:54:27.780 align:start position:0%
dollars the median rental for an
 
06:54:30.530 --> 06:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
apartment is over two grand
 
06:54:30.540 --> 06:54:32.030 align:start position:0%
apartment is over two grand
so

06:54:32.030 --> 06:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:54:35.090 --> 06:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
like I said there's much more demand
 
06:54:36.590 --> 06:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
than Supply
 
06:54:38.150 --> 06:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
landlords are not going to have a
 
06:54:41.510 --> 06:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem thank you so much Mr chairman
 
06:54:42.890 --> 06:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
 
06:54:42.900 --> 06:54:46.610 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the
representative

06:54:46.610 --> 06:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:49.910 --> 06:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
06:54:49.920 --> 06:54:54.770 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
and

06:54:54.770 --> 06:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:57.590 --> 06:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
all right the last card I have is Alyssa
 
06:54:57.600 --> 06:55:04.010 align:start position:0%
all right the last card I have is Alyssa
margolin

06:55:04.010 --> 06:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:05.750 --> 06:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman again for the
 
06:55:07.670 --> 06:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
record Alyssa Morgan I serve as director
 
06:55:10.250 --> 06:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
of housing action New Hampshire most of
 
06:55:11.628 --> 06:55:11.638 align:start position:0%
the members of housing action New
 
06:55:13.548 --> 06:55:13.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are landlords of affordable
 
06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
housing properties and we do support
 
06:55:19.368 --> 06:55:19.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1200. we have supported
 
06:55:21.530 --> 06:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
different versions of this bill there
 
06:55:23.810 --> 06:55:23.820 align:start position:0%
are other versions that connected notice
 
06:55:25.968 --> 06:55:25.978 align:start position:0%
to more significant increases as
 
06:55:27.890 --> 06:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
attempts to just
 
06:55:33.650 --> 06:55:33.660 align:start position:0%
um to add uh 15 days and align with uh
 
06:55:36.590 --> 06:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
with other New England states I just
 
06:55:38.390 --> 06:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
thought I would share some data around
 
06:55:40.730 --> 06:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
our renter population for the committee
 
06:55:45.468 --> 06:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
about 29 of all Granite Staters lit rent
 
06:55:49.128 --> 06:55:49.138 align:start position:0%
so their homes are rented I think that's
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
somewhat surprising because in many
 
06:55:53.690 --> 06:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
towns you don't necessarily a lot of our
 
06:55:56.270 --> 06:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
rentals are are owned by smaller
 
06:55:57.948 --> 06:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
landlords who don't really recognize it
 
06:56:01.490 --> 06:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
as as rental properties but 29 29 of our
 
06:56:04.610 --> 06:56:04.620 align:start position:0%
population does rent their homes of all
 
06:56:08.510 --> 06:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
of our renters over 50 percent are what
 
06:56:11.208 --> 06:56:11.218 align:start position:0%
we called housing costs burdened meaning
 
06:56:13.490 --> 06:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
they're paying too much of their income
 
06:56:16.430 --> 06:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
per month towards housing costs and so
 
06:56:18.830 --> 06:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
we know that for some extremely low
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
income people that are creating
 
06:56:23.930 --> 06:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
um really financially fragile situations
 
06:56:26.690 --> 06:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
because of increases in rent they can be
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
paying close to 80 percent of monthly
 
06:56:30.590 --> 06:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
income towards housing costs but we know
 
06:56:32.810 --> 06:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
that this is a little confusing but we
 
06:56:35.270 --> 06:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
know that half of our renters pay over
 
06:56:38.628 --> 06:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
50 and the standard for affordability is
 
06:56:42.170 --> 06:56:42.180 align:start position:0%
is closer to 30 in including um
 
06:56:45.650 --> 06:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know costs for for uh heat
 
06:56:49.070 --> 06:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
electricity and um on internet
 
06:56:50.090 --> 06:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:56:53.448 --> 06:56:53.458 align:start position:0%
uh given this if I you know there's
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
really not a broad Statewide tenant
 
06:56:58.490 --> 06:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
organizing organization in our state and
 
06:57:00.590 --> 06:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
housing action New Hampshire represents
 
06:57:02.330 --> 06:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
landlords and affordable housing
 
06:57:04.910 --> 06:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
developers but I would say that if we
 
06:57:07.968 --> 06:57:07.978 align:start position:0%
had tenants here today they might tell
 
06:57:11.448 --> 06:57:11.458 align:start position:0%
you that notice is a gift I mean when if
 
06:57:13.430 --> 06:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
you want to put your yourself in the
 
06:57:15.530 --> 06:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
shoes of say a single mom with some kids
 
06:57:17.330 --> 06:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
and you find out that you're going to
 
06:57:21.048 --> 06:57:21.058 align:start position:0%
have to pay an increase in rent that
 
06:57:24.590 --> 06:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
notice might allow you to seek other
 
06:57:26.510 --> 06:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
sources of income to me you might decide
 
06:57:29.990 --> 06:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
to stay just to have to plan and find
 
06:57:32.570 --> 06:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
the time to search for an apartment and
 
06:57:35.208 --> 06:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
so we see this in terms of our eviction
 
06:57:37.548 --> 06:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
prevention work and ending homelessness
 
06:57:40.010 --> 06:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
we see this as as a part of that
 
06:57:42.350 --> 06:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
solution in in the eviction prevention
 
06:57:44.510 --> 06:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
and housing stability work that we try
 
06:57:46.368 --> 06:57:46.378 align:start position:0%
to do as we navigate the housing crisis
 
06:57:48.230 --> 06:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
so I'll conclude my testimony and happy
 
06:57:50.510 --> 06:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
06:57:50.520 --> 06:57:52.910 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
questions

06:57:52.910 --> 06:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:57:55.010 --> 06:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
is margolin
 
06:58:00.170 --> 06:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:04.390 --> 06:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
Miss McGowan is it still realistic that
 
06:58:07.730 --> 06:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
the tenant rent burden be no more than
 
06:58:11.930 --> 06:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:13.250 --> 06:58:13.260 align:start position:0%
well I mean I think that's a fair
 
06:58:14.930 --> 06:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
question because I think many of us have
 
06:58:16.490 --> 06:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
lived through times in our lives when we
 
06:58:17.570 --> 06:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
know that we've paid more than 30
 
06:58:20.510 --> 06:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
percent but it's defined in statute that
 
06:58:23.330 --> 06:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
affordability is 30 a voucher for
 
06:58:26.330 --> 06:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
example would cover 70 if you were to be
 
06:58:28.310 --> 06:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
lucky enough to just cure a voucher and
 
06:58:30.890 --> 06:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
be able to find a place to use it uh on
 
06:58:32.868 --> 06:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
them in the market
 
06:58:34.910 --> 06:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know it's I think it's also
 
06:58:36.890 --> 06:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
fair to say that renter income has gone
 
06:58:38.990 --> 06:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
up we know wages have gone up
 
06:58:41.208 --> 06:58:41.218 align:start position:0%
um but they have not kept pace with the
 
06:58:44.150 --> 06:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
cost of the major increases in housing
 
06:58:47.150 --> 06:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
costs so I don't have uh I'm not looking
 
06:58:49.850 --> 06:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
at the sheet now it used to be that
 
06:58:52.730 --> 06:58:52.740 align:start position:0%
renter income in New Hampshire was 14 an
 
06:58:56.390 --> 06:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
hour and uh housing wage what you need
 
06:58:59.390 --> 06:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
to earn per hour to afford a typical
 
06:59:02.810 --> 06:59:02.820 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment was 23 an hour my
 
06:59:04.788 --> 06:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
guess is that 14 has gone up a couple
 
06:59:07.968 --> 06:59:07.978 align:start position:0%
dollars and then um just because we know
 
06:59:10.368 --> 06:59:10.378 align:start position:0%
that there are wage increases in a lot
 
06:59:12.830 --> 06:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
of the hospitality industry and
 
06:59:15.530 --> 06:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
um as and Retail as we try to retain and
 
06:59:17.510 --> 06:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
sustain Workforce here in the state but
 
06:59:19.548 --> 06:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's kept pace but you I
 
06:59:21.530 --> 06:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
do think it's still a fair measure of
 
06:59:23.330 --> 06:59:23.340 align:start position:0%
affordability the more you spend on
 
06:59:25.490 --> 06:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
housing the less you have to spend in
 
06:59:27.230 --> 06:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
other areas so it hurts the economy
 
06:59:29.390 --> 06:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
overall if you're spending all of your
 
06:59:31.610 --> 06:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
monthly income on housing costs you're
 
06:59:33.288 --> 06:59:33.298 align:start position:0%
don't you have less to give to your
 
06:59:35.448 --> 06:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
local community you've left to go out to
 
06:59:37.788 --> 06:59:37.798 align:start position:0%
a restaurant you know less to support
 
06:59:41.090 --> 06:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
the local baseball team and
 
06:59:43.610 --> 06:59:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and and provide clothes and medicine
 
06:59:49.490 --> 06:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:49.500 --> 06:59:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
other

06:59:51.830 --> 06:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
again I guess my question comes down to
 
06:59:59.810 --> 06:59:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:01.910 --> 07:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
this does nothing about
 
07:00:04.010 --> 07:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
the cost of the housing
 
07:00:06.468 --> 07:00:06.478 align:start position:0%
in the sense that it doesn't control the
 
07:00:09.468 --> 07:00:09.478 align:start position:0%
costs and it specifically provides that
 
07:00:10.910 --> 07:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
you can raise any amount you want
 
07:00:10.920 --> 07:00:12.310 align:start position:0%
you can raise any amount you want
basically

07:00:12.310 --> 07:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
basically
 
07:00:14.330 --> 07:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
it only
 
07:00:17.868 --> 07:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
addresses the timing of increases
 
07:00:20.810 --> 07:00:20.820 align:start position:0%
and basically in terms of two weeks or
 
07:00:23.810 --> 07:00:23.820 align:start position:0%
15 days for the most part
 
07:00:23.820 --> 07:00:25.070 align:start position:0%
15 days for the most part
so

07:00:25.070 --> 07:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:00:27.708 --> 07:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
and the representation has been that
 
07:00:29.810 --> 07:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
this will have an impact on homelessness
 
07:00:32.990 --> 07:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to figure out in my mind
 
07:00:33.000 --> 07:00:34.208 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying to figure out in my mind
whether

07:00:34.208 --> 07:00:34.218 align:start position:0%
whether
 
07:00:38.090 --> 07:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
simply providing 15 more days or two
 
07:00:38.100 --> 07:00:39.110 align:start position:0%
simply providing 15 more days or two
weeks

07:00:39.110 --> 07:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
07:00:42.288 --> 07:00:42.298 align:start position:0%
is going to have any substantial impact
 
07:00:42.298 --> 07:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
is going to have any substantial impact
upon

07:00:44.150 --> 07:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
upon
 
07:00:44.160 --> 07:00:45.708 align:start position:0%
upon
homelessness

07:00:45.708 --> 07:00:45.718 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
07:00:48.708 --> 07:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
I do think it would be a tool in the
 
07:00:51.010 --> 07:00:51.020 align:start position:0%
toolbox for eviction prevention eviction
 
07:00:53.448 --> 07:00:53.458 align:start position:0%
eviction prevention equates to
 
07:00:57.110 --> 07:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
homelessness prevention the best way at
 
07:00:59.208 --> 07:00:59.218 align:start position:0%
preventing the increase of homelessness
 
07:01:00.708 --> 07:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
is to prevent people from becoming
 
07:01:02.990 --> 07:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
homeless in the first place it's not a
 
07:01:05.448 --> 07:01:05.458 align:start position:0%
it's not it's very hard once you're
 
07:01:07.010 --> 07:01:07.020 align:start position:0%
homeless to get back into the market
 
07:01:08.690 --> 07:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to find a landlord who's
 
07:01:10.968 --> 07:01:10.978 align:start position:0%
going to rent to you when your address
 
07:01:13.788 --> 07:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
is currently the shelter it's really
 
07:01:16.368 --> 07:01:16.378 align:start position:0%
hard on kids like homelessness is really
 
07:01:18.890 --> 07:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
damaging to kids as much as folks try to
 
07:01:21.230 --> 07:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
engage in evidence evidence-based
 
07:01:22.730 --> 07:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
programming do I think this is the
 
07:01:24.230 --> 07:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
Panacea and the answer to everything
 
07:01:26.750 --> 07:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely not but it's a tool I don't
 
07:01:29.930 --> 07:01:29.940 align:start position:0%
think it's onerous my members don't find
 
07:01:34.010 --> 07:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
it onerous they're they already work
 
07:01:37.250 --> 07:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
they do raise rents and they already you
 
07:01:38.868 --> 07:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
know work to provide notice to make sure
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
that people aren't displaced and I do
 
07:01:42.350 --> 07:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
think if we had more representation
 
07:01:43.968 --> 07:01:43.978 align:start position:0%
today out of hearing from people who
 
07:01:46.610 --> 07:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
really live this
 
07:01:48.468 --> 07:01:48.478 align:start position:0%
um that they would tell you that that
 
07:01:53.810 --> 07:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:56.930 --> 07:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:58.190 --> 07:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
the parts that are part of your
 
07:02:00.350 --> 07:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
Coalition yeah
 
07:02:03.770 --> 07:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I but are most of the are those
 
07:02:05.868 --> 07:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
government subsidized
 
07:02:06.948 --> 07:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
07:02:06.958 --> 07:02:07.968 align:start position:0%
so yeah
um

07:02:07.968 --> 07:02:07.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:02:10.010 --> 07:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
our Coalition is made up of those who
 
07:02:13.070 --> 07:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
develop manage and own affordable
 
07:02:16.310 --> 07:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
housing properties and they are mission
 
07:02:18.590 --> 07:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
oriented landlords so they're in the
 
07:02:20.030 --> 07:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
business of making sure that people can
 
07:02:22.310 --> 07:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
afford and sustain housing even some
 
07:02:24.170 --> 07:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
cases they'll provide housing for folks
 
07:02:26.208 --> 07:02:26.218 align:start position:0%
earning up to 120 of every meeting
 
07:02:26.218 --> 07:02:27.890 align:start position:0%
earning up to 120 of every meeting
income

07:02:27.890 --> 07:02:27.900 align:start position:0%
income
 
07:02:30.288 --> 07:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
um but they're in the business of making
 
07:02:32.930 --> 07:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the affordable housing
 
07:02:35.868 --> 07:02:35.878 align:start position:0%
stock in New Hampshire they are in favor
 
07:02:38.750 --> 07:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill they think that notice is
 
07:02:40.910 --> 07:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
helpful they already do that that's
 
07:02:43.610 --> 07:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
their already their practice because of
 
07:02:46.010 --> 07:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
their their mission oriented so they
 
07:02:48.410 --> 07:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
they see this as a way of asking others
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
in the private Market to do the same
 
07:02:52.490 --> 07:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they would say it's
 
07:02:55.548 --> 07:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
gonna it would be a cure-all but I think
 
07:02:57.110 --> 07:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
that they would say it's a tool in the
 
07:02:59.628 --> 07:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
toolbox other states already have
 
07:03:01.610 --> 07:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
um this kind of notice thank you for the
 
07:03:01.620 --> 07:03:02.270 align:start position:0%
um this kind of notice thank you for the
question

07:03:02.270 --> 07:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
07:03:03.650 --> 07:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:03:05.990 --> 07:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
07:03:08.990 --> 07:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony again today
 
07:03:10.490 --> 07:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
07:03:14.270 --> 07:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill 1200
 
07:03:16.190 --> 07:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
yes have you filled out a pink card I
 
07:03:19.128 --> 07:03:19.138 align:start position:0%
did fill out a big card okay it was much
 
07:03:21.288 --> 07:03:21.298 align:start position:0%
earlier on today I gave it to a
 
07:03:24.890 --> 07:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
different clerk than uh rep okay but you
 
07:03:27.048 --> 07:03:27.058 align:start position:0%
know and I hate to make you do that
 
07:03:28.310 --> 07:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
again but could you do that again
 
07:03:29.868 --> 07:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
because I don't seem to have it for
 
07:03:31.010 --> 07:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
somebody you want to do that afterwards
 
07:03:32.930 --> 07:03:32.940 align:start position:0%
afterwards yes I can definitely do that
 
07:03:34.730 --> 07:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
again that'd be great thank you thank
 
07:03:36.890 --> 07:03:36.900 align:start position:0%
you uh for the committee for having me
 
07:03:39.048 --> 07:03:39.058 align:start position:0%
here today um my name is Jonah wheeler
 
07:03:40.910 --> 07:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm with rights and democracy but I come
 
07:03:43.610 --> 07:03:43.620 align:start position:0%
here today as a citizen and a student
 
07:03:46.010 --> 07:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
from Peterborough New Hampshire
 
07:03:49.010 --> 07:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
um I I am a tenant I am living this
 
07:03:51.288 --> 07:03:51.298 align:start position:0%
experience right now or rather my mother
 
07:03:54.948 --> 07:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
is a tenant and I come in lieu of of her
 
07:03:56.510 --> 07:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
she's a single mother who cannot be here
 
07:03:58.730 --> 07:03:58.740 align:start position:0%
today so if I have the free time I'll
 
07:04:00.410 --> 07:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
I'll do it
 
07:04:02.208 --> 07:04:02.218 align:start position:0%
um I can say that this is
 
07:04:03.530 --> 07:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say that this would end
 
07:04:05.750 --> 07:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness uh and I wouldn't I don't
 
07:04:07.850 --> 07:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
have any data or anything to to prove
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
anything near that fact but as someone
 
07:04:14.270 --> 07:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
who has been homeless and has had rent
 
07:04:17.208 --> 07:04:17.218 align:start position:0%
fall through and has seen that happen in
 
07:04:18.590 --> 07:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
the effects that it has on a whole
 
07:04:18.600 --> 07:04:19.610 align:start position:0%
the effects that it has on a whole
family

07:04:19.610 --> 07:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
family
 
07:04:23.330 --> 07:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
I can tell you two weeks is a nice
 
07:04:26.810 --> 07:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
cushion to have if we were low on rent
 
07:04:29.270 --> 07:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
or about to be evicted having that two
 
07:04:31.730 --> 07:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
weeks would be a perfect Comfort cushion
 
07:04:34.128 --> 07:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
in order to figure something out figure
 
07:04:36.590 --> 07:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
a separate situation out if it might not
 
07:04:39.770 --> 07:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
be staying in that house but it's having
 
07:04:41.930 --> 07:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
a place to stay if you're not in that
 
07:04:44.150 --> 07:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
house I've been in that situation a
 
07:04:46.190 --> 07:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
couple of times where you have housing
 
07:04:48.170 --> 07:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
fall through immediately or close to
 
07:04:51.170 --> 07:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
immediately and then in that specific
 
07:04:53.868 --> 07:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
situation we were forced to live in a a
 
07:04:56.570 --> 07:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
tent community in Greenville I think it
 
07:05:01.010 --> 07:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
was so as much as young families
 
07:05:03.110 --> 07:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
families with single mothers and and
 
07:05:05.330 --> 07:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
small children can avoid that and try to
 
07:05:07.670 --> 07:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
find a different situation stay in the
 
07:05:08.750 --> 07:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
house until they've found a different
 
07:05:10.010 --> 07:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
situation I think that would be
 
07:05:13.310 --> 07:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the working class in this
 
07:05:14.990 --> 07:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
state it wouldn't address homelessness
 
07:05:16.610 --> 07:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't address the price of housing I
 
07:05:17.810 --> 07:05:17.820 align:start position:0%
think that has to be addressed in
 
07:05:21.288 --> 07:05:21.298 align:start position:0%
different legislation but in providing a
 
07:05:24.128 --> 07:05:24.138 align:start position:0%
comfort to those disadvantaged people
 
07:05:26.990 --> 07:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
before they're out on the street this is
 
07:05:29.090 --> 07:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
a great piece of legislation for that
 
07:05:32.030 --> 07:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
and yeah with that thank you I'll take
 
07:05:34.868 --> 07:05:34.878 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them yeah
 
07:05:37.548 --> 07:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
Joe and I found your card and I had
 
07:05:38.990 --> 07:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
called you earlier on a different
 
07:05:41.090 --> 07:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
hearing but I see you signed up for this
 
07:05:42.770 --> 07:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
hearing and that was my fault well I was
 
07:05:45.830 --> 07:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
also in uh the room 100 over there so I
 
07:05:47.330 --> 07:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
was gone thank you thank you very much
 
07:05:51.830 --> 07:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:53.628 --> 07:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Wheeler thank
 
07:05:53.638 --> 07:05:54.530 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Wheeler thank
you

07:05:54.530 --> 07:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:05:56.510 --> 07:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
and there was somebody else who had
 
07:06:06.190 --> 07:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:09.288 --> 07:06:09.298 align:start position:0%
I have a bad pin card right here
 
07:06:10.788 --> 07:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
um so for the record uh my name is
 
07:06:12.708 --> 07:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
Brandon Lemay from Manchester New
 
07:06:14.448 --> 07:06:14.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm representing rights and
 
07:06:16.850 --> 07:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
democracy and the Manchester housing
 
07:06:16.860 --> 07:06:17.868 align:start position:0%
democracy and the Manchester housing
Alliance

07:06:17.868 --> 07:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
Alliance
 
07:06:21.590 --> 07:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh so first off um I think if I could
 
07:06:24.230 --> 07:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
summarize this bill in one word I would
 
07:06:26.048 --> 07:06:26.058 align:start position:0%
say reasonable
 
07:06:28.968 --> 07:06:28.978 align:start position:0%
as an affordable housing Advocate I
 
07:06:31.788 --> 07:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
would like to see restrictions on you
 
07:06:33.410 --> 07:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
know how much that rent could be raised
 
07:06:37.310 --> 07:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
but I understand that that might not be
 
07:06:39.128 --> 07:06:39.138 align:start position:0%
in agreement with everybody in this room
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
so rather than you know thinking about
 
07:06:46.310 --> 07:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
the art of what's perfect I would rather
 
07:06:48.048 --> 07:06:48.058 align:start position:0%
like to achieve the art of what's
 
07:06:50.390 --> 07:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
achievable and I think this is
 
07:06:52.250 --> 07:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable here
 
07:06:55.010 --> 07:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
and I think this bill would benefit two
 
07:06:56.628 --> 07:06:56.638 align:start position:0%
main types of people that I've
 
07:06:59.090 --> 07:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
encountered uh while I go door to door
 
07:07:01.310 --> 07:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
talking to renters in middle class and
 
07:07:02.930 --> 07:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
lower income neighborhoods
 
07:07:05.030 --> 07:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
the first group are the month of the
 
07:07:06.350 --> 07:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
month renters
 
07:07:09.170 --> 07:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty common now to see
 
07:07:12.170 --> 07:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
monthly increases I was talking to a
 
07:07:13.730 --> 07:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
tenant yesterday on the west side of
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester who said that her rent has
 
07:07:17.868 --> 07:07:17.878 align:start position:0%
gone up twenty dollars a month every
 
07:07:20.170 --> 07:07:20.180 align:start position:0%
month for the past three months
 
07:07:23.690 --> 07:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
and I I'm a big proponent of personal
 
07:07:26.868 --> 07:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility and part of that means
 
07:07:26.878 --> 07:07:27.968 align:start position:0%
responsibility and part of that means
budgeting

07:07:27.968 --> 07:07:27.978 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
07:07:30.590 --> 07:07:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I just think it makes it difficult
 
07:07:33.530 --> 07:07:33.540 align:start position:0%
to budget when your rent is going up
 
07:07:36.770 --> 07:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
every single month I'm somebody I like
 
07:07:38.690 --> 07:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
to know you know I plan out when I get
 
07:07:40.788 --> 07:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
my pay when I get my direct deposit when
 
07:07:43.128 --> 07:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
the rent's coming out and I can budget
 
07:07:45.890 --> 07:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
around accordingly I just don't know how
 
07:07:48.350 --> 07:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
and increase every 30 days can actually
 
07:07:50.628 --> 07:07:50.638 align:start position:0%
be something I could manage around
 
07:07:53.390 --> 07:07:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think with these extra 15 days that
 
07:07:55.850 --> 07:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
we'd be getting uh you know maybe you
 
07:07:57.230 --> 07:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
could think about how to pick up an
 
07:07:59.930 --> 07:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
extra shift or maybe you can use those
 
07:08:02.510 --> 07:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
extra 15 days to think about and apply
 
07:08:05.270 --> 07:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
to more you know Apartments
 
07:08:08.448 --> 07:08:08.458 align:start position:0%
um and I think the second group that
 
07:08:10.968 --> 07:08:10.978 align:start position:0%
this would apply to a lot of renters
 
07:08:14.150 --> 07:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
myself included have a clause in our
 
07:08:17.510 --> 07:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
lease that our rent can be increased at
 
07:08:20.208 --> 07:08:20.218 align:start position:0%
any time during the duration
 
07:08:22.910 --> 07:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
um it just it really affects a lot of
 
07:08:24.410 --> 07:08:24.420 align:start position:0%
renters here
 
07:08:26.448 --> 07:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
um and again I just don't know how
 
07:08:28.190 --> 07:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
somebody can be expected to take
 
07:08:30.708 --> 07:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility over their finances when
 
07:08:32.510 --> 07:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
they can't predict you know their
 
07:08:34.850 --> 07:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
biggest expense
 
07:08:36.830 --> 07:08:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and I did want to address a previous
 
07:08:39.468 --> 07:08:39.478 align:start position:0%
speaker about this possibly raising the
 
07:08:40.850 --> 07:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
price of rent
 
07:08:43.968 --> 07:08:43.978 align:start position:0%
um we we live in a market economy and
 
07:08:46.968 --> 07:08:46.978 align:start position:0%
the price of rent is dictated by how
 
07:08:50.628 --> 07:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
much renters can pay and maybe some
 
07:08:52.490 --> 07:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
expenses here and there for landlords
 
07:08:54.590 --> 07:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
like property taxes
 
07:08:56.030 --> 07:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
um you know repairs to the roof and
 
07:08:58.190 --> 07:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
stuff like that I think as we've
 
07:08:59.628 --> 07:08:59.638 align:start position:0%
discussed landlords have a lot of
 
07:09:01.730 --> 07:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
Leverage right now they can easily rent
 
07:09:03.890 --> 07:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
out that next apartment
 
07:09:05.270 --> 07:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
um you know to the next person that's
 
07:09:08.030 --> 07:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
willing to pay that rent increase so I'm
 
07:09:09.770 --> 07:09:09.780 align:start position:0%
not necessarily worried about this
 
07:09:11.750 --> 07:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
having such a negative impact on
 
07:09:13.490 --> 07:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
landlords especially when you weigh it
 
07:09:15.650 --> 07:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
against how much the market favors them
 
07:09:16.788 --> 07:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
right now
 
07:09:19.368 --> 07:09:19.378 align:start position:0%
so I'll end my testimony there and open
 
07:09:20.750 --> 07:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
up to any questions
 
07:09:22.128 --> 07:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Lemay
 
07:09:25.788 --> 07:09:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:27.830 --> 07:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
07:09:29.330 --> 07:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
very much
 
07:09:32.448 --> 07:09:32.458 align:start position:0%
okay uh is there anybody else who wishes
 
07:09:35.390 --> 07:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
to testify on House Bill 1200 seeing no
 
07:09:40.548 --> 07:09:40.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:09:41.830 --> 07:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any other
 
07:09:44.750 --> 07:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
business that we need to address if not
 
07:09:46.490 --> 07:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
then the committee will be recessed
 
07:09:59.570 --> 07:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:06.170 --> 07:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:28.788 --> 07:10:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:28.798 --> 07:10:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

07:10:54.410 --> 07:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
07:10:59.150 --> 07:10:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:04.968 --> 07:11:04.978 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:34.548 --> 07:11:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:27.590 --> 07:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:52.128 --> 07:12:52.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:54.770 --> 07:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
coming yes I saw that
 
07:12:59.810 --> 07:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:01.448 --> 07:13:01.458 align:start position:0%
yeah but the committee
 
07:13:01.458 --> 07:13:03.968 align:start position:0%
yeah but the committee
outside

07:13:03.968 --> 07:13:03.978 align:start position:0%
outside

07:13:08.100 --> 07:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
250
