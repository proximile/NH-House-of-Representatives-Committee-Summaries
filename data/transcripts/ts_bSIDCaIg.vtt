00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
I realized maybe maybe citizens want to
 
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:08.150 align:start position:0%
I realized maybe maybe citizens want to
know

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
City all right our subcommittee is all
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
present we had um a little bit of a
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
weather delay there but we'll we'll get
 
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.269 align:start position:0%
weather delay there but we'll we'll get
started

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I want to start out by trying to
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh think about what we might accomplish
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
today and uh I'll start with saying I
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
think the reason that the
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
chairman put together this subcommittee
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
is that when we were listening to the
 
00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
questions during the public hearing
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
there was some of them seemed to be
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
focusing on details of the bill and
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
saying well is this necessary is this
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
part necessary and I think he had an
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
idea that there might be a way to amend
 
00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
it that it would be broadly accepted
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
cable um as I've worked on it as I've
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
done some more reading I'm not sure that
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
that's where we're headed at all
 
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:12.389 align:start position:0%
that's where we're headed at all
um

00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:16.279 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll put that aside as a
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
goal um certainly what when we come to
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
the end and we make our subcommittee
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation it's whatever we we
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
decide to recommend uh but I don't think
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we want to head I also so
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a productive use of
 
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
this committee if we're let's say 2 two
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
on the recommendation to debate it here
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
so that we can tell the full committee
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
that oh we had a debate and we didn't
 
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
come to any
 
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion however um
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
what has occurred to me in the time
 
00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
between the public hearing and now is
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
think I didn't have a real clear
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
understanding of issue at the end of
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
that meeting and in the time between
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
then I've traded some emails with people
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
I've read some information about um
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
federal and state law I've looked at the
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
rules that we talked about and at least
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
I think I'm coming to a better
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of where we are today than
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
what I was
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
thinking last week and if this
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee accomplish that if it we at
 
00:11:33.629 --> 00:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
least can all agree that this is this is
 
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
where we are today even if we agree or
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
disagree on what where we should go
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
forward I think that would be an
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
accomplishment so that's kind of where I
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
want to start and I'll start by talking
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
and then you're already talking I I'll
 
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:51.880 align:start position:0%
I'll continue by talking and hopefully
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
I'll stop talking soon enough
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
so this is what what I heard yet last
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
week in the hearing is that there were
 
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.470 align:start position:0%
week in the hearing is that there were
two

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
issues um that needed to be addressed
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
the first was a specific issue about
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
that happened at Plymouth state with
 
00:12:17.189 --> 00:12:17.199 align:start position:0%
raas that were employees and there and
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
maybe shouldn't have been and there was
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
no way to resolve the issue the second
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
one which is a little more broader in
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
general is that there's a a gap or maybe
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
even a conf lict
 
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
between the way the US Department of
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
Labor would look at a situation and the
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
way New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
would look at a situation so very
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
quickly my updated understanding I'll
 
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
start with the second is yes it's true
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh US Department of Labor has one way of
 
00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
looking at this and it's not exactly the
 
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
same way New Hampshire Department of
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
Labor is but I think it's a lot closer
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
than what I
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
understood a week ago um and the answer
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
is if you go to the US Department of
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
Labor and you say we have this ra um and
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
there's some concern is it an employee
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
the answer from US Department of Labor
 
00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:16.519 align:start position:0%
will be well it
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
depends and it depends on there there's
 
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
a list in their Manual of ways that that
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
ra might be compensated and if it fits
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
some of them but not others then they're
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
not an employee
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
presumably if it's a little different
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
then they will be so it's not a
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
clear-cut answer on that side if we go
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
to the State Department of Labor the
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
answer will be it depends and it won't
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
be it's not exactly the same factors and
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's not the same
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
process but um and hypothetically yes
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
there could be the federal comes to one
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion state comes to the opposite
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
but at least as far as I can tell on a
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
practical basis that's not necessarily
 
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
happening I'm not sure we have actual
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts out there where the federal
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
government says one thing the state says
 
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:17.720 align:start position:0%
another and and the two can't
 
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.230 align:start position:0%
another and and the two can't
meet

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
meet
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
um so I'll skip ahead to then the
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State situation seemed to be
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
just such an
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
example and what I've learned about
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
there is that was and
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
that as I understand it and and if I'm
 
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
wrong shake your head vigorously uh the
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
rule change it this whole thing must be
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago that it came up
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
because it looked like the rule change
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
2016 um
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
and yeah yes and in fact
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
the wait this isn't a public hearing so
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
you could either if you're going to be
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
answering a lot you could sit at one of
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
the one of the regular chairs and that
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
have just to and so for anyone who may
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
not um know I'm Danielle Albert with the
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor so the
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
rule change I believe that you're
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
referencing is in relation to New
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's administrative rules at lab
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
805 um specifically provision 805
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
505 uh the the entirety of that rule
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
went into effect at a date that I do not
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
recall but there was an amendment to
 
00:15:43.949 --> 00:15:43.959 align:start position:0%
8055 that was approved and and published
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
through that whole gel car process I
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
want to say in October of this year oh
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
so that is it's very recent it's very
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
very recent now the rule itself is an it
 
00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
has been around for some period of time
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
but the department amended that that
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
80505 section of the rule uh to address
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
a concern that we understood from the
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
University system in engaging with them
 
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
over the course of the uh PSU inspection
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
case um such that there is an Avenue or
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
mechanism available for any employer it
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply just to colleges or to
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
universities who has a
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
student um participating in in some kind
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
of practical experience program which is
 
00:16:29.069 --> 00:16:29.079 align:start position:0%
what that whole section of rules is
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
outlining uh but also to allow that
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
student to hold a regular paying job at
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
the same time whereas the prior rule did
 
00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
not allow for sort of a dual
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
relationship of that nature and kind of
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
coming to a college or university type
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
scenario if you have somebody who let's
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
say for example is an RA and they are in
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
an approved you know the ra position is
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
an approved practical experience program
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
they can do that for sub or no um can be
 
00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
approved for sub minimum wage or no wage
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh but ALS maybe work in the bookstore
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
in the cafeteria for a regular paying
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
job making minimum wage they can hold
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
the the Dual roles without
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
issue and I'm just going to repeat some
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
of that because until you explained it
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
it was I didn't understand what the
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
issue at at Plymouth state was and this
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
was a case where the students in
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
question were definitely employees there
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
was no question about that because they
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
for example worked in the bookstore and
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
they received a wage for that payment
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
and the the issue was so they're also an
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
RA and how does that interact it's the
 
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
same entities involved but is it still
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
an employer employee relationship and
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
the rules after the change allowed you
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
to deal with that Nuance that it right
 
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
with with with the Nuance that addresses
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
the rule change I don't believe and I'm
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
looking at Miss preventure she can
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
correct me if my recollection is poor I
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
don't believe that the issue in the PSU
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
case was uh specifically that we had
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
students who were holding both roles the
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
Department's assessment of the ra
 
00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:06.919 align:start position:0%
position as it was constructed in that
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
particular case was it kind of exceeded
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
um it walked into the realm of
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
employment um for a host of different
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
factors am I remembering that come
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
are they they control that upstairs but
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
I would assume they've put the camera
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
uh good morning um uh Katherine
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
preventure I serve as the chief
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
administrative officer of the University
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
system so um Miss alare is absolutely
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
correct the there was a rule change in
 
00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:43.830 align:start position:0%
correct the there was a rule change in
October

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
because when we learn more app um as a
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
result of the Plymouth inspection there
 
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
were all kinds of tentacles to to the
 
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
issue now let me if I can try to explain
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
the Plymouth
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
similar to the Dartmouth students
 
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:04.600 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Ras received a
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
stipend and they also received free room
 
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
and board and if if memory serves the
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
dartman students receive meal a l a meal
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
plant but not not
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
room so when you receiving a stipend
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting a W2 and you are an
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
employee but what also comes with that
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
you need to be tracking your hours we
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that minimum wage is paid
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
and I will
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
say I believe that this is an issue at
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
other colleges in the state that are
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
paying stipend and the RAS are not
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
tracking time which is when we went back
 
00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:48.919 align:start position:0%
and relied on the federal the US do
 
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines that indicate raas in an
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
educational program are generally not
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
considered employees under F FS SL
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
SLA um I believe one of the someone else
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
had testified that that the is it
 
00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
nlr I'm not going to get my alphabet sou
 
00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
correct nlrb that that raas do have a
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
right under the
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
NL um B I'm sorry um to yes organize so
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
that conflict is in at the federal level
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
as well right they're
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
not generally required to follow
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
fsla and and the same thing would happen
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I believe if this
 
00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass that the
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
plrb would decide whether or not raas
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.190 align:start position:0%
wanted to
um

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
organized however I come back
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
to if Ras are employees and subject to
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire time and wage law it's
 
00:20:59.230 --> 00:20:59.240 align:start position:0%
my understanding they need to track
 
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.909 align:start position:0%
my understanding they need to track
their

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
time um and we need to ensure that
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
they're paid minimum wage and that we
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
get um M messed then then there are
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
issues with free room and board right
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
how do we continue to provide free room
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and board if that can't be part of the
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
compensation at least the room so in in
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
an effort to try to align the federal
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines with New Hampshire law this
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
is where we are I will tell you the the
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding the rule that was
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
adopted in
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
October would
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism for any employer
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
waiver applying for the waiver presumes
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
they're an employee otherwise you
 
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to apply for
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
waiver um but we're I'm still not clear
 
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
on whether or not the waiver needs to be
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
filed or for every ra at every
 
00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
institution every semester or whether
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
each institution could apply for the
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
waiver we're still not certain on on how
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
that mechanism will work and
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
um so that that's while that mechanism
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
is available I don't know what how
 
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
administratively that will roll out if
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
every ra every semester needs a wer
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
approved or whether they'd be
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
approved and so why don't we do that
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
last part first you can answer that in
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
reverse order okay so one as it relates
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
to um filing an application for it
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
waiver exemption it's it's um in these
 
00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances the and the origin of it
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
if it's a helpful at all it stems from
 
00:23:02.269 --> 00:23:02.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 27922 AA that's the statutory
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
provision from which these um learning
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity type programs stem from and
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
then the administrative rules that apply
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
are at 805 1 through 5 um I do not
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
believe that a any program whether
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
you're a university or some other type
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
of employer you wouldn't have to
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily file an application per
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
student you could file an application
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
for the program and maintain a list of
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
students and the department would be
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
looking for that to be updated you know
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
at least annually just to assure that
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
the program that the nature of the
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
program itself hasn't altered or changed
 
00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:32.720 align:start position:0%
and again it's meant to be like a
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
practical experience there's some kind
 
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
of you know learning opportunity that
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
these student participants and honestly
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's a section that applies to
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
disabled individuals as well but we're
 
00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
talking specifically about students here
 
00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:47.320 align:start position:0%
um are engaging in so you know using
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
raas as an example mentorship leadership
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
community service you know could all be
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
um sort of practical could be
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
conceptualized as practical experience
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh that a student could have so in a
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
role like that if an application for the
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
program were filed the list of students
 
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
were maintained and or provided to the
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
department at request and was approved
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
by dep the department uh then the the uh
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
employer The Entity to whom these uh
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
raas are providing um said service that
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
entity can then be approved to pay
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
either sub minimum or no wage that's
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
what the statutory mechanism and the
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
rule allow for and a followup part of
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
the conver ation that we had had um you
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
could submit such a request that doesn't
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
make the person an employee so that was
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
something you said that just because
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
they apply for a waiver doesn't
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
automatically reclassify it's an
 
00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
interesting question so for the purposes
 
00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
of minimum of if you look at the at the
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
800 rules I think at
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
803 uh the which talks about exemptions
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
it makes clear that that individuals
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
participating and again because there's
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
a section of the statute that also
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
applies to disabled individuals but
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
students in an approved progr in a
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
program approved under 805 are not going
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be considered employees for the
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of 279 and
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
27542 so the the sections that are
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
applicable towards wage payment minimum
 
00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
wage and wage payment um so for those
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
purposes I don't think they they um
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
would qualify as employees it would not
 
00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
be counted and I guess just
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
and so to clarify let's imagine a
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
situation where there's no compensation
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
whatsoever they're an RA but it's purely
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
voluntary so if somebody were to just
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
ask you is this an employee you'd say no
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
because it it doesn't mean it but in
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
that case if a university said you know
 
00:25:53.389 --> 00:25:53.399 align:start position:0%
we heard that Ra's need to waiver so
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to ask for
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't necessarily change the
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
landscape you
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
can the fact that they ask for a waiver
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't automatically mean that oh now
 
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:07.880 align:start position:0%
you need a waiver
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
because you ask for it
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
that and and I I seem to recall with
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
them what you wrote in the email was
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
there's no harm in putting a waiver in
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
place oh without knowing whether it's
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
necessary there there's never any harm
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
in any employer filing for one um there
 
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
are certainly circumstances where uh ERS
 
00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
outside of the univ University system
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
file an application with the department
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
for the subminimum or no wage payment
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
approval and the department screens the
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
application and says this is not a
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
position that rises to the level of
 
00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
employment um you know it's not needed
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
so there's no harm in ever putting it
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
forward that that was what uh I meant in
 
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:50.440 align:start position:0%
saying you know you can always you can
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
always do that anybody can file with on
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
receipt the Department's going to look
 
00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:57.399 align:start position:0%
at it and screen it and assess you know
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
is it something that's appropriate to be
 
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
here you know is it something that falls
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Labor's purview
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
if it is a scenario where okay um you
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
know there is the that the employment
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
factor is there do you meet the criteria
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
through the application there's some
 
00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:15.399 align:start position:0%
kind of practical learning experience
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that issue because again it can't just
 
00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
be I don't want to pay minimum wage and
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's my basis for applying we're
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
looking is there some kind of practical
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
um learning experience component
 
00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:26.679 align:start position:0%
associated with that that and if that's
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
there then the department can approve it
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
and again now the entity with whom the
 
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
student is is providing that service for
 
00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:37.399 align:start position:0%
has an exception to paying you know the
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
minimum wage um or the or can pay no
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
wage so the there's like essentially an
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
exception to the requirements to pay
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
minimum wage uh that comes with that
 
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.110 align:start position:0%
minimum wage uh that comes with that
approval

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
ran I think there's several points that
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh need to be made here um first one is
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
what we're just hearing on this waiver
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
through the Department of Labor seems
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
like it might resolve the issue um in
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
and of itself without any legislative
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
change um number two um the bill as
 
00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:12.669 align:start position:0%
change um number two um the bill as
presented

00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
removes um the employment um definition
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
from five different sections of
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
Statute way more than we could possibly
 
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.230 align:start position:0%
Statute way more than we could possibly
need

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
um number three
 
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
I don't like removing um employee rights
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
um from anybody ever so that that gives
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
me a problem with the bill from from the
 
00:28:40.509 --> 00:28:40.519 align:start position:0%
get-go But
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
continuing um this um in in our hearing
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
we heard from UNH no students but we did
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
hear from UNH we heard from Dartmouth
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the four um Ras who came to testify um
 
00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
and we heard about um Plymouth
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
um so we've got
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
information um for three different
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
schools we have no information for the
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
rest of the colleges in New Hampshire
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
this bill if um passed would affect all
 
00:29:15.149 --> 00:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
colleges in New Hampshire some of them
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
being um priv would be private sector
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
employees some of them would be public
 
00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:20.509 align:start position:0%
employees some of them would be public
sector

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
sector
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
employees um what we found out very
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
clearly is that Plymouth UNH and
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth had very different systems of
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
compensation for Ras um and um I would
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
guess only a guess but I would guess
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
that if
 
00:29:42.029 --> 00:29:42.039 align:start position:0%
we heard from all of the other colleges
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
we would find quite a few more um
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
methods of compensation um but we have
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
no idea what they are so my suggestion
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
is if we do anything now there are
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
inevitably going to be unintended con
 
00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
consequences for some of the colleges
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
who don't even know this is
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll just put it out there because I
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
don't like taking employee rights away
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
from anybody itl sounds really good to
 
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.990 align:start position:0%
from anybody itl sounds really good to
me

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
um but if that's not the path this would
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely need further study before we
 
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
could go forward with anything and I
 
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
think um those who have concerns can
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of Labor on the
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
potential for a waiver um if they're
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
concerned about the minimum wage aspects
 
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
of this um so
 
00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
so all of your points are well made and
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
at the beginning at least somewhere in
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
my head that first point you made is
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
where I wanted to focus because you you
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
make a really good point if in fact the
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
existing situation given the change in
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
the rules are going to satisfy what
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
satisfy then then the subcommittee can
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
tell that the committee that well
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's no need to update the law at
 
00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
this point because it's working and and
 
00:31:11.789 --> 00:31:11.799 align:start position:0%
and I can clearly see the issue with
 
00:31:14.509 --> 00:31:14.519 align:start position:0%
minimum wage that that is clearly a
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
problem for um Ras um because I think
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
some of them put in a little bit of time
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
some of them put in a lot of time and um
 
00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:26.440 align:start position:0%
um if you can resolve that piece I I
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
think I think we're done here and and
 
00:31:30.669 --> 00:31:30.679 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll say the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but I'll I'll repeat
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
it the the the law that she cited the
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
22A and the rules that result from that
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
are not limited exclusively to to
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
minimum wage which to me so the
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
department can say you have a couple of
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
issues here one is the minimum wage one
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
is maybe the overtime provision uh
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
they could identify multiple issues that
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
then they can grant a waiver for and I'm
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
going to just jump in and clarify just
 
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it is clear if I
 
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear earlier the waiver or
 
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
exemption that stems through the 27922
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
daa and lab um administrative rule 805
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
sector um is exclusive to to payment of
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
wages so minimum wage payment of wages
 
00:32:26.509 --> 00:32:26.519 align:start position:0%
record keeping related to wages um it
 
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
does not extrapolate necessarily to the
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
Discrimination sections to the workers
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
compensation sections um yeah yes
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
excellent clarification because that is
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
was also part of yes your question so um
 
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
for for the moment I'd like to
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
continue the conversation that we
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
started and where I'm focusing is what
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
are things today now that this rues in
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
effect and how much does it already
 
00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.470 align:start position:0%
effect and how much does it already
resolve

00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
resolve
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
and um then then we'll go from there I'm
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
not sure if it comes down to a
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
disagreement over some of your
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
other what needs to be in this bill how
 
00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:15.559 align:start position:0%
could you possibly disagree what how
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
could you possibly
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
disagree it might be outside the scope
 
00:33:22.029 --> 00:33:22.039 align:start position:0%
of the subcommittee it might be a debate
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
to have next week in front of the full
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
commit that's I don't want to stay here
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
I I was kidding yes okay Mr chairman I
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
just had a quick question as it relates
 
00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:33.799 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
determination uh and I'm not a member of
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
this committee and I appreciate the uh
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity to speak uh the
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
question I have is is if somebody files
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
for determination by the do for a class
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
of workers is there any do work the
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
workers have a standing in in those
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussions can they argue uh submit
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
some some kind of testimony relative to
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
to that particular decision being made
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
so is it a one-sided thing I guess is
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying there there's
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
involvement with the the
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
um like the individuals are notified so
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's not just a one-sided a program
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
files an application or a school or
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
whomever is submitting files and
 
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:19.720 align:start position:0%
application and the the the
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
individual who is is in the learning
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity um program is completely cut
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
out of it
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
so they're they're
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
aware so it's not it's not I wouldn't
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
call it one-sided I would not say that
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's like it's not a communication Just
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
Between the department and the The
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
Entity so that it's a surprise to the
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
person who's participating they they are
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
aware and may participate in the I mean
 
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:47.720 align:start position:0%
partic it this isn't one of those
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
processes where the Department's having
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
meetings necessarily I mean applications
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
are filed written communication goes
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
back and forth um so I I don't I would
 
00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
not color it as the the student
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
individual is completely cut out of it
 
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
and then it's just like oh I was
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
anticipating getting paid and now I'm
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
not getting paid they have notification
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
of it uh they receive copies of the
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
application approval they're seeing the
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
they're they have awareness of that
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
process I'd have to maybe solidify with
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
our uh the specific individuals who are
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
processing these applications how
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
granular that contact contact can get
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
and I think that depends on the nature
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
of what submitted in any types of
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions that may be raised or if
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
somebody if they're aware that a
 
00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
program's been submitted contacts us to
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
say hey I have qualms about that I think
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
it can depend on the scenario but it but
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
it's not one where the participant is
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
just they have no awareness that it's
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
going on it's not they're not completely
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
cut out of
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
it a just a couple of points
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan Debbie scary the
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
executive director from the New
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire college and university council
 
00:35:58.829 --> 00:35:58.839 align:start position:0%
is here and she has kind of scanned all
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
of the colleges in the state if you're
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
interested to to know how those Ras are
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
compensated I want to I want to try to
 
00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
be clear
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
um we we are not we don't want to take
 
00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
rights away from our Ras we want to be
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to compensate
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
them with a sizable credit to their bill
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
so they can participate in residential
 
00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:28.750 align:start position:0%
so they can participate in residential
college

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
college
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
experience that those are not those
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
credits on their bill are not taxed so
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's not considered a wage and the
 
00:36:41.069 --> 00:36:41.079 align:start position:0%
RAS do not track time and I think you
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
heard that from the Dartmouth Ras even
 
00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
though they get a stipend they're not
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
tracking time and and of itself there's
 
00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
some conflict there
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
so our effort is to try to allow the RAS
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
to get free room and
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
board for their participation in the
 
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
program not tax we're really trying to
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
thread the needle I guess under the
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
usdol guidelines but still want to be
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
compliant with New Hampshire state law
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
and we had found again at Plymouth that
 
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
we need to we need to start all the RAS
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
would need to start tracking time and so
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
when we reached out to the New Hampshire
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
college and university Council and they
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
scanned the the colleges in the state we
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
found the same situation that folks
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
aren't tracking time what do we need to
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
do to comply so that's what got us where
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
we are today and I want to throw
 
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
something in because I started this out
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
by saying well if you went to US
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor their answer would
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
be it
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
depends and um specifically I have that
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
section from their book up uh on the
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
screen so those Ras they say the
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
students are not employees on under the
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
act under the Labor Act if they receive
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
renumeration in the form of reduced
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
rumor board charges freeuse of telephone
 
00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
tuition credits and the like so some of
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
the circumstances we've heard you'd look
 
00:38:15.069 --> 00:38:15.079 align:start position:0%
at this and you'd say you know what do
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
is not going to exempt them they might
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
say well what is in the like it isn't
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's something outside of this list
 
00:38:26.589 --> 00:38:26.599 align:start position:0%
but it's like this list so so I think
 
00:38:31.069 --> 00:38:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's not as clearcut as in all cases
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
that well US Department of Labor would
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
say absolutely not an employee and now
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have a state issue I I think in each
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
case and as we say it it it's going to
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
vary widely it's going to depend on the
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
details um and yes there is a slightly s
 
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
different process federal and state to
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
consider those
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
details on the other hand there is a
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
process federal and state to take those
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
details into
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
account and part of the qu but hopefully
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
to come to the right
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
answer and part of the question that if
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
we can come to that today is are are we
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
able to come to the right answer are
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
there cases where we're not able to come
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
not oh
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
I guess I just reiterate that where we
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
are is uh looking at a bill that removes
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
rights from five different um areas of
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
the statutes and and that I'm I would
 
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
say for right now forget the bill what I
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to look happy and and let's look
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
at what is what exists right now because
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
it has
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
changed since we've we've been here in
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
this term the rules have been adapted
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
and it if there was an issue two years
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
ago that may not be an issue now so what
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to First understand is where
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
are we today and we might be happy where
 
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
we are today we might be unhappy where
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
we are today but only in once we know
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
that should we consider well what do we
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
do about it
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
so I I agree with that there are
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill as written
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
um but there's no point in figuring out
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
those problems or even debating those
 
00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
problems if we all agree that it it's
 
00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
not the path that we need to
 
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.030 align:start position:0%
not the path that we need to
take

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
fine so I don't
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
know uh did I cut you off on something
 
00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
that you perceived as a question that
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
you didn't get to answer I don't believe
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
so but if so I've
 
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
forgotten and and what what what I'm
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
hearing is in terms of where we are
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
today is we have rules in place that
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
give uh
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
the colleges and universities um some
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
options with regard to clarifying um
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
exactly where their Ra's uh stand in
 
00:41:10.589 --> 00:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
terms of employment status Unemployment
 
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh and other wage issues and so from
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
your standpoint part of it was a
 
00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
question you weren't
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure how that might work and whether it
 
00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
was practical did this
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
discussion well enlightened the
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
situation it enlightened but we I still
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how the the process will
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
actually work and hopefully those
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
waivers would be approved that's but you
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
apply for a waiver so those need to be
 
00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
approved just a little point of
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
clarification on the unemployment I I
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't mean to say unemployment
 
00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
R Ras are already as soon as I said that
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
I thought back to the Senate um uh
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
hearing where um Deputy Commissioner
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
labors made it very clear that U you
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
know we we you've got no issues here
 
00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's already excluded right so sorry
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
sorry I just
 
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
misspoke so one question I asked the
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
department which is sort of where you're
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
headed is are there
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
outstanding problems where an employer
 
00:42:16.589 --> 00:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
is asked thinks they should have a
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
waiver and the department thinks they
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't and it it has not been
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
resolved and the answer was to me was
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
you weren't aware of any globally I I
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
was understanding the question to be in
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
line with
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
universities yes so you know globally I
 
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
I didn't dig you know overarchingly um
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
but as far as uh the department as far
 
00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware from my understanding from
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
communicating with the division that is
 
00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:45.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for uh taking in and
 
00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
reviewing and monitoring these
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
applications to date we've not had any
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
filed by any college or university and
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
so there are no outstanding disputes
 
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
because we simply have not had one uh
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
had one for this type of position let me
 
00:42:58.430 --> 00:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
ref that I I think there are
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
universities that have um various
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
programs or entities that have filed
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
them uh for practical experience that
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
may involve a university and and I think
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
that's accurate um but not 100% sure but
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
there have been none filed for an RA
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
type of position so we don't have any
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
for Ari types of positions so um and
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
again there are I know around the state
 
00:43:23.549 --> 00:43:23.559 align:start position:0%
within the university system um we
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
provide free room and board but there's
 
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
not a stipend
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
and that free room and board
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
aligns right now let me back up when we
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
had the inspection at pouth Plymouth we
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
were providing a stipend with room and
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
board we stopped the stipend because of
 
00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
the inspection and with the time
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
tracking and all of that so um I guess
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
my question for the Department is with
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
the waiver for institutions that are
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
providing free room and board with no
 
00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.190 align:start position:0%
providing free room and board with no
stipend

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
stipend
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
that I think aligns with that us do
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
paragraph do those institutions need to
 
00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
apply for the
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
waiver it's a good question so I I I'm
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
never comfortable giving an absolute
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
answer and saying no they never have to
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
because it it it does you know depend if
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have um a
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
relationship with the individual who is
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
providing whatever service it is such
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
that that it would kind of fall within
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
that employee employer relationship
 
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:32.440 align:start position:0%
where wages would be paid you you might
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
not need one right cuz it's it's
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
intended to provide an exemption or a
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
waiver to a requirements to pay wages
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
for time that's being worked so you
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
might not but again it really depends on
 
00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:49.480 align:start position:0%
a number of different factors
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
well right as you was speaking I'm sorry
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
having a conversation with Deputy
 
00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioner actually if memory serves
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
the the waiver also part of our other
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
problem we were having was so okay so
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
now we have an RA that's not an employee
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
that they don't get a W2 for the value
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
of their room and board they don't track
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
their time but they work in the
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
bookstore now we do have an employee
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
relationship and so the waiver
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
also helps with
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
that uh that that was another problem
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
when we were working through all of
 
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.870 align:start position:0%
when we were working through all of
these

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
and sorry to talk over you I got very
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
excited I think that's where some of the
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
the rule change kind of came from I
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
think that's part of what we heard from
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
the University system so again if you
 
00:45:38.589 --> 00:45:38.599 align:start position:0%
have under the prior iteration of the
 
00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
rule if you had a student like an RA and
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
there was interest or intent to have the
 
00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:47.079 align:start position:0%
ra position we'll say met the you know
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
the stien still there it met the
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
elements or requirements for an employee
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
employer relationship but the um
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
university is interest you know we don't
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
want to pay the minimum wage we want
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
exception to Pro to pay minimum wage
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
track hours we want an exception to all
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
of that uh under prior iterate and the
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
person also the ra also had a job full
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
paying job in the bookstore were very
 
00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's also an employment
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
relationship uh agreement was you're
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
going to get $ 725 an hour or $10 an
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
hour whatever it is that gets paid under
 
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
prior iteration of the rule the program
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't be approved because you don't
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
you could not the individual the
 
00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:21.640 align:start position:0%
participant couldn't hold dual rules we
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
altered the rule to allow individuals
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
participating in Practical experience
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
programs to be able to hold kind of both
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
you can participate in a practical
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
experience program and not get paid for
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
it because the department has approved
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
through the mechanisms in place uh
 
00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
either no wage rate if that's what's
 
00:46:42.510 --> 00:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
been approved but also have a you know
 
00:46:44.109 --> 00:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
full paying job where you're getting the
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
minimum wage or higher than that if
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the job you know is agreed
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
for so now both both can be fulfilled so
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
they would not conflict with one another
 
00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:53.640 align:start position:0%
anymore um I think that was the our
 
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of of some of the concern
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
that the university had so altered the
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
rule to allow for that and again not
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
just for the University system but for
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
any you know employer who may have a
 
00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:06.230 align:start position:0%
any you know employer who may have a
similar

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
scenario right and and and if I can
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
clarify that issue has been resolved by
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the rule change regardless of whether
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
there's any waivers or anything is that
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
correct the rule change is a section of
 
00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
rules that's specific to the waiver so I
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
I I think it does apply to the waiver so
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
what the rule change did was it allowed
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
for an
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
employer uh an entity to have a
 
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:34.280 align:start position:0%
individual participating in Practical
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
learning experience and we'll I'll stick
 
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
with the ra theme because that's kind of
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here that was
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
an approved program practical learning
 
00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
experience is coming through that an
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
application's been filed the department
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
has looked at the application yes we
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
agree leadership and um community
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
service and all of that is going to
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
qualify under uh as practical experience
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
through this program so we're going to
 
00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
give the approval to pay less than the
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
minimum wage or no no wage you can also
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
ask for no wage so we'll give the
 
00:48:02.549 --> 00:48:02.559 align:start position:0%
approval to pay no wage that provides
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
the exemption to the requirements under
 
00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:06.280 align:start position:0%
279 and
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
2752 the definition of employee under U
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
27542 uh in all those attendant pieces
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
um but if that same individual who's
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
participating or series of individuals
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
if you have multiple raas who are
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the Practical learning
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
experience for no wage are not barred or
 
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
precluded from holding a job in the
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
bookstore whereas under the rule it
 
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
caused a problem you couldn't do it so
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
we adjusted the rule to allow for both
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
to happen for the individual
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
participating in the program
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
simultaneously without interfering with
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
the paying job with the routinely paying
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
job that nobody's seeking waver or
 
00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:44.319 align:start position:0%
exception to and I'll briefly
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
editorialize I
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
think as I've learned more about this
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
there's an advantage to this waiver
 
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
process that we've set up in that they
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
can look at the details that have we
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
said they're going to vary every
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
situation is going to be a little
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
different it also allows the department
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
to say hey we've never seen anything
 
00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
like this before let's let's figure this
 
00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.230 align:start position:0%
like this before let's let's figure this
out

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
whereas changing the
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
law is a one-sized fits all change so
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's important to let this
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
um rule change um work itself through to
 
00:49:22.270 --> 00:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
find out how it's going to function um
 
00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:24.040 align:start position:0%
because we've had no applications from
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
this type of um situation so
 
00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm not sure if there's a
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
mechanism by well I think because we've
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
got folks here who are intimately
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
involved with the uh uh universities and
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
colleges in um New Hampshire that they
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
will become aware of the waiver
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
situation let's let it
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
work so I don't know if you want you
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
have a reaction to that I would also um
 
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:55.640 align:start position:0%
whether you do or not miss sky is that
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
um if you have any kind of input to that
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the broader range of
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
universities and you're welcome to take
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
another microphone so we don't have to
 
00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.950 align:start position:0%
another microphone so we don't have to
swap

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
seats did you have anything first I
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
didn't want to cut you
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
off uh no other than um we don't know
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
how the waiver process is going to work
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh it just again the rule was just
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
adopted last fall after our our fall
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
semester had started and we because this
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislation was moving through the
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
process actually the change in the
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
rule the Genesis of that was the
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
University system the New Hampshire
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
college and university Council working
 
00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
with the Department of
 
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
Labor be at the same time um we are
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
working with the sponsor because as you
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
can tell from the
 
00:50:53.789 --> 00:50:53.799 align:start position:0%
conversation the there are a lot of
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
needles to thread here in in in hopes of
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
continuing to
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
provide our you know our students
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
um you know a way to have free room in
 
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
board not taxed but have another job on
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
campus not track time um
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
so will the waiver process work I don't
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
have any reason to think it won't I will
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
say it will get extremely
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
administratively burdensome if we need
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
to f F separate waiver applications for
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
every ra for every semester and there
 
00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
was that was a question a couple months
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
ago so and I heard the answer is no I
 
00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:43.839 align:start position:0%
believe you would have to I think there
 
00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
can be an application filed sort of for
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
the the Practical experience program
 
00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
itself now a list of participating
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
students will need to be maintained and
 
00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that will
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
rotate because it changes per semester
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
um so long as that's maintained uh at
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
least annually the department would kind
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
of want to see the application refiled
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
just to assure that the program that has
 
00:52:06.510 --> 00:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
been approved itself hasn't changed um
 
00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
you know but but I I don't believe you
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
would need to file one per student that
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
would be I think I understand that would
 
00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
be an administrative burden and that
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of paper for us to take
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
in as well and really what we're looking
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
at is the program um and who's
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
participating in the program so again
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a list but you don't
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
have to if if there's a hundred students
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the list you can it's almost like an
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
attachment to the program as opposed to
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
one per person and and again in in the
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
specific example within the university
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
system when there's where there's no
 
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
stipend paid so there's no
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
W2 again I'm so we're still considering
 
00:52:40.799 --> 00:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
W2 again I'm so we're still considering
them

00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
employees contrary to the federal
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
guidelines because applying for a
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
waiver in and of itself if in and of
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
itself they're defined as employees you
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply for waiver if they
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
weren't employees
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll repeat what you said and
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
then you can add so not
 
00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.910 align:start position:0%
then you can add so not
necessarily

00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
that they may be they may not be if you
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
just said I don't think I need a waiver
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
are they employees the department would
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
think about that and they would answer
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
one way or another if you instead said
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
you know I'm going to need a waiver I'm
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
not sure if they're employees the
 
00:53:24.990 --> 00:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
department may say you know we looked at
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
this but they're they aren't even
 
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:28.839 align:start position:0%
employees to begin with so you don't
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
need this waiver there's
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
no this was the explanation there's no
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
downside to saying do we need a waiver
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
let me file the information so you can
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
evaluate it they may say yes we they're
 
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
employees and we Grant you the waiver
 
00:53:47.549 --> 00:53:47.559 align:start position:0%
they may say they weren't employees to
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
begin with you didn't need the waiver
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
and I I think what's become clear is
 
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
that um there are a lot of different
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
entities out there who are evaluating
 
00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
the employment status of these folks um
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
there's the um Fair labor standards act
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
there's the nlrb there's the plrb
 
00:54:10.230 --> 00:54:10.240 align:start position:0%
there's the Department of Labor um
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
there's the um Department of Employment
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
Security they've already uh weighed in
 
00:54:17.549 --> 00:54:17.559 align:start position:0%
um so there's there's a lot of different
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
folks who are going to make this
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
determination and
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
um I will say it again this bill deals
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
with five different
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
and that it's interesting we'll discuss
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
that for a moment because it does make a
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
certain point that there are and we know
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
this having worked on labor for a long
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
time there are different definitions of
 
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
employees throughout the statutes we've
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
we made an effort a few years ago to
 
00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:start position:0%
make try to get them so they match we
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
still haven't and here is and here is an
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
example of you when you
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
if you ask the question is this an
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
employee or not well relative to what
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
and there's any number of statutes that
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
may the answer may come different out
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
different depending
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
on what the Contex and we and we know
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
that on a federal level the nlrb views
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
it one way and the LSA views it a
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
different way and and that was by the
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
way that was another thing I read I'll
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
I'll bring it up I didn't know whether I
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
don't know if we want to go here but I
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
I'll bring it up because I did I did
 
00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
take the time to read it the
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth nlrb petition on the
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
basketball team and I was interested I
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
think you probably know because I
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
remember your questions from the
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
hearing it was an issue are these
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
students employees and the university
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
had one opinion that the and
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
the application for organization had
 
00:55:58.750 --> 00:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
another and what the nlrb did was they
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
didn't go to federal law they didn't go
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
to state law they used dictionary
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
definitions of what an employment
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
relationship is and they went through
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
and say are do these things
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
exist and I don't think we were ever
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to resolve the the issue of I
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
we're not going to make all this stuff
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh align right and so in my opinion what
 
00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
whatever we did we wouldn't affect that
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth decision because it's a a
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
national level and they didn't refer to
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
laws so changing the laws shouldn't
 
00:56:38.309 --> 00:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
impact that decision now on a state
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
level I am not aware that our PB has
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
gone through this issue of what's an
 
00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:47.720 align:start position:0%
employee what isn't if they did we don't
 
00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:48.910 align:start position:0%
employee what isn't if they did we don't
know

00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
what we don't know what how they
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:59.029 --> 00:56:59.039 align:start position:0%
a change in law and how that might
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
impact a future decision I think is a
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
Fool's game we we just have no way to
 
00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
predict this unless somebody put in a
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
law and said the plb shall decide this
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
which that is not leader
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
so yes I'm I'm agreeing with you and I
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
think the point is well made that this
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
bill shows
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
the what happens when we're trying to
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
Define empy mment as a as a a singular
 
00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
thing when in fact in existing law in
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
existing practice it always depends on
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the context and each College might be
 
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:41.190 align:start position:0%
the context and each College might be
different

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
exactly but this if I
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
could there's a and I think you've
 
00:57:49.309 --> 00:57:49.319 align:start position:0%
expressed it representative Solan this
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
this takes place people rights but it it
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
also seems to me that um it kind of uh
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
creates this um class of
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
employees who can be who are out of the
 
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.069 align:start position:0%
employees who can be who are out of the
employment

00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
employment
 
00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
environment and yet still in the college
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
and university doing all of this work as
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
was described by the doop students um
 
00:58:16.789 --> 00:58:16.799 align:start position:0%
and without some kind of standing in
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
this process they are really just
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
employee it's not employees they just
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
people who can be um I I I'm I'm going
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
to say this that they can be
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
overworked they can be made to work
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
24-hour shifts as has been described and
 
00:58:35.029 --> 00:58:35.039 align:start position:0%
what we're doing is we're taking away
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
potentially taking away their ability to
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
be able to advocate for themselves in
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
this whole process and even in the case
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
of the of a waiver there is no standing
 
00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
that employees currently have employers
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
file there is this kind of system where
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll get a hold of 100
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
employees maybe who knows if they even
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
though this is going on they come back
 
00:59:00.829 --> 00:59:00.839 align:start position:0%
and bang it's it's over so this is this
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
leaves people and workers in our RA in
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
this kind of crazy little spot where
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have no standing no that somebody
 
00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:11.119 align:start position:0%
else is making the decisions that that
 
00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
affects their lives in a very big way
 
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that if broadly that's also
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
a an issue that we can't resolve so for
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
example when I was an undergradu
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
graduate I had a class where we had to
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
work on some stuff so in some ways I was
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
doing work but nobody paid me I was
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
paying for the privilege of attending
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
the class where I would fix a a car
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
engine um so where does that fall into
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
place and if you if you don't have the
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
ability to say you know there's a gray
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
area between a student listening to a
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
lecture and a person who's who's being
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
paid to come in 40 hours a week and do
 
01:00:03.150 --> 01:00:03.160 align:start position:0%
labor I think we can we can
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
never um appreciate the full spectrum of
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
what goes on in a learning environment
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
so except to the extent that that what
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
was described to us uh is a situation
 
01:00:20.829 --> 01:00:20.839 align:start position:0%
where these people on duty 24 hours a
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
day this is this is this is testimony
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that was yes the
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
issue I don't believe that's the issue
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will fruitfully discuss
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
another thing that I heard was
 
01:00:49.150 --> 01:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth did not contest that there was
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
an employee relationship there there was
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
some disagreement on how to define that
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
relationship and this is what I heard
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
the student saying but there wasn't a
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
disagreement that there was a
 
01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
relationship so I don't believe there
 
01:01:05.349 --> 01:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
was any disagreement between the raas
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
and Dartmouth and the administration at
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they're they're okay well I
 
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
would add though they said they're not
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
tracking their time and yes and that's
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
exactly what got Plymouth in trouble so
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
there's no that if they're not tracking
 
01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
their time then there's no way to
 
01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not they're earning
 
01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:30.520 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and that's why we're here
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
but they might be well advised to seek
 
01:01:32.559 --> 01:01:33.990 align:start position:0%
but they might be well advised to seek
the

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
waiver I had a question I wasn't clear
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
if you represent only the public
 
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
university system or if you represent
 
01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
the private as well I I'm my apologies
 
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I represent the university system of
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is Plymouth Kean and
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
UNH and Miss skiri is the executive
 
01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire college
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
and university Council that includes all
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
the colleges public and private in the
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
state except Dartmouth that's
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
interesting thank
 
01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
you so representative
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
Kum oh okay and if I can I'm so sorry to
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
to jump in and interrupt and it's a
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
little bit tangental to representative
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's um comments but just so that
 
01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
I've adequately explained uh some of the
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
application process because I didn't
 
01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:26.039 align:start position:0%
walk through you know every step uh in
 
01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:27.559 align:start position:0%
the process part of what the department
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
screaming for it's outlined in the rules
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
itself and I'm happy to share a full
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
copy of the rules with the committee if
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's helpful to look at them in their
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
entirety and I did the I sent an email
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
around to the members of the
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that had that link in the
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
attachment okay um I can I yeah the link
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
send it to the full committee link to
 
01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
the full rule is there um but some of
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
what is screened on you know for
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility purposes is one of the
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
requirements in obtaining one of these
 
01:02:56.829 --> 01:02:56.839 align:start position:0%
waivers you can't be dis placing you
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
know the the regular Workforce so no
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
employer or or educational institution
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
or post-secondary school can put forward
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
an application and say well I don't want
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
to hire regular employees anymore I just
 
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
want to have practical experience
 
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.400 align:start position:0%
Learners so we're just going to get rid
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
of our paid positions and apply for
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
subminimum no minimum wage rate so again
 
01:03:16.829 --> 01:03:16.839 align:start position:0%
it's meant to be kind of a learning you
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
know practical learning experience it's
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
not displacing the workforce it's it's
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
so there are certain standards that are
 
01:03:25.349 --> 01:03:25.359 align:start position:0%
embedded within the application process
 
01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:26.309 align:start position:0%
embedded within the application process
uh

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
you know if it's Youth and these are
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
college students we're talking about so
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
the youth labor walls are not going to
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
apply but certainly you know
 
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
applications come in for youth you know
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
assuring that we're not doing dangerous
 
01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
things in violation of hazardous orders
 
01:03:40.589 --> 01:03:40.599 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature so there are
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
some um there are some criteria that are
 
01:03:45.309 --> 01:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
built in that is evaluated on receipt
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
that the department is looking at as
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
part of the program so I just I don't
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
know if that's helpful at all I think
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
it's a little tangential to your
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
commentary representative Mackenzie but
 
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted that to to be clear and
 
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.510 align:start position:0%
I just wanted that to to be clear and
known

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
known
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
and and to be clear I think this
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
legislature has a role in seeing whether
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
a Department administra administrative
 
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
process is working or not working um my
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
suggestion is it's kind of outside the
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
scope of this meeting here
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
today so um I think your points are well
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
made and uh to the extent that they go
 
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
to what we should recommend on this bill
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
they're they're definitely relevant but
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
um there's a bigger picture here that
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
you're you're talking about much bigger
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
if we needed to to seek more information
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
to understand that there aren't there
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
isn't a coverage of Labor rights for
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
those employees I mean I'd be open to to
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
interim study I mean if that's something
 
01:04:53.309 --> 01:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
we thought we could bring the interested
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
parties to um um to talk about that I
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
don't know how you feel but I mean I
 
01:05:01.990 --> 01:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't oppose an interim study and to
 
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:03.400 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
that and and we'll let's come back to
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
that but let's get there pretty soon and
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
yes so but before we do I asked uh you
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
to come up and if we're missing a
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
perspective that's outside of
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
um no I'm very happy to share it's very
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
nice to be here I'm Debbie skiri I um
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
lead the new hampsh college and
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
university Council represents as um
 
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
Kathy preventure has said um all the
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities in New
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um with the exception of
 
01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth um Thomas Moore college and
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
Magdalene College as well so um we
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
represent most most everyone so um in
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
preparation for this um this
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
conversation and so forth I reached out
 
01:05:50.029 --> 01:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
to the colleges and universities um to
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
put together sort of a quick chart of
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
sort of where people were at and exactly
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
as you have said um every it seems like
 
01:05:59.269 --> 01:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
every school is a little bit different
 
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
everyone seems to be approaching it in a
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
way that works for their own institution
 
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
and in line with what they um believe is
 
01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:07.720 align:start position:0%
is the right way to go so we have you
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
know folks that um are um identifying
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
their resident assistance as quote
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
unquote student employees which they're
 
01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
very quick to say would be characterized
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
um like temporary part-time employees um
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
we have folks that you know say no
 
01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
they're not employees at all um um they
 
01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
are being reimbursed some of them with
 
01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
with room um they're boarded um some uh
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
discounted meal plan or maybe even a
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
full meal plan there are some stiens
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
involved too um and uh the other piece
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
of that is I could find no evidence of
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
anyone um really tracking hours um as
 
01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
far as this particular position goes but
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy to answer any questions
 
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
and happy to share the the data that
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
I've pulled together um whatever would
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
be most
 
01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
helpful if um is that data do you have a
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
a right it's still like a little chart
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
to make it really easy I'd be more than
 
01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
that all sure thank you oh
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
good and if there's an extra
 
01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative love would you like one
 
01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
of these yes there's one right here for
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
you oh got one there all right sorry we
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
I will put it in the full committee F or
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
folder this isting representative are we
 
01:07:47.789 --> 01:07:47.799 align:start position:0%
did do you have a we're kind of going in
 
01:07:50.670 --> 01:07:50.680 align:start position:0%
a certain direction if there's a another
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay so one of the things I'll Echo um
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
what representative Selvin was saying
 
01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
this committee has a tradition of when
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
we like the way things work without our
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
involvement we like to stay out of it
 
01:08:12.309 --> 01:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
and what I'm hearing today is well we
 
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
may not be able to know whether it's
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
working the way we like it right
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
now it's might be worth giving it a
 
01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
chance to see if the process works as
 
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
chance to see if the process works as
intent

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
intent
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
right now before we go in and and make
 
01:08:29.799 --> 01:08:32.229 align:start position:0%
right now before we go in and and make
additional

01:08:32.229 --> 01:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
changes I I agree um there's effectively
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
a rule a set of rules that have been uh
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
amended um that have not been um
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
utilized and it sounds to me like that
 
01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
may very well take care of um much of
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
what is a problem um if those rules
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
come up short and there are still some
 
01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.789 align:start position:0%
come up short and there are still some
issues

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
um let's hear about it next year year
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
after something like that but uh um it
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like that's something that
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
ought to be explored first before we um
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
go in with a sledgehammer and um make
 
01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:15.870 align:start position:0%
go in with a sledgehammer and um make
massive

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
massive
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
changes and with respect to the interim
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
study I guess it's a timing issue if we
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
thought we were going to learn a bunch
 
01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:24.759 align:start position:0%
of stuff before the end of the year an
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
interim stud would be a vehicle to
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
provide that report the alternative is
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
to you know the filing period's not that
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
far off for the next
 
01:09:36.749 --> 01:09:36.759 align:start position:0%
legislature that's that's what the
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
interim stud is going to do anyway
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
anyway it's going to either recommend
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
for additional legislation or not
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that that accomplishes a
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
great deal doesn't say I guess it could
 
01:09:52.630 --> 01:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
be a legislation of this nature or
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
something like that but bottom line is
 
01:09:57.870 --> 01:09:57.880 align:start position:0%
um no no one has to file that bill um
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
someone can file the bill without the
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation or in opposition to the
 
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.229 align:start position:0%
recommendation or in opposition to the
the

01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation exactly and I guess what
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is if we really thought there
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
was going to be a bunch of information
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
pouring in this summer interim study
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
would be a great way to collect it um
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's what we're looking
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
at and
 
01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's at any time that a deficiency in
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
the process is identif ified a bill of
 
01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
correct what what is perceived to be
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
time I I've already suggested that itl
 
01:10:45.790 --> 01:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
would be um something I could easily
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
support all right so I
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
will uh write down that you have made a
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
and before I before I continue on and
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
ask for a second um I know there were I
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
kind of picked the people that that I
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear from if there was someone
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
that came here today and had uh
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
something important they wanted to
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
discuss I don't want to cut you off at
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
the same time this this is not a hearing
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
we not been there done that we don't
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
need to do it again okay agreed agreed
 
01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
but I didn't want I didn't want anybody
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
to feel like they came all the way down
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
here and we didn't want they're just
 
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
here to watch that's okay so is there a
 
01:11:37.629 --> 01:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
second to representative San's motion
 
01:11:37.639 --> 01:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
second to representative San's motion
all

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:46.070 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
um and I always write this in the wrong
 
01:11:51.070 --> 01:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
every time I write it and in an
 
01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
amendment line instead of on the bill on
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
01:11:59.629 --> 01:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
um so is there any discussion on the
 
01:12:02.830 --> 01:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation that representative Solan
 
01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.629 align:start position:0%
recommendation that representative Solan
has

01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
made you're just going to leave us in
 
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:13.709 align:start position:0%
made you're just going to leave us in
[Laughter]

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
suspense all right well I'm going to
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this I'll ask you to vote
 
01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.370 align:start position:0%
deal with this I'll ask you to vote
first

01:12:18.370 --> 01:12:18.380 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.830 align:start position:0%
first
[Laughter]

01:12:21.830 --> 01:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:12:24.990 --> 01:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes yes n itl I'll say
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
yes yes and R yes all right so we will
 
01:12:32.629 --> 01:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee itl and
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
explain um what we have learned about
 
01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
the rule process and why we're
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
recommending in a much shorter version
 
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
yes maybe I'll let you explain it since
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
you made the motion I I have a habit of
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
getting oh that makes sense off track
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
here all right thank you very much for
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
uh coming and participating and and
 
01:12:56.189 --> 01:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
teaching us about the process
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
just a reminder there is another
 
01:13:01.270 --> 01:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting at 2 p.m. I'm not
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
on no you're not none of us are well he
 
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:07.400 align:start position:0%
might he is
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
but plent time
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
home this a very interesting topic so
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
you guys went through like in that um
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
section on like for example the minimum
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
wage there's all those weird categories
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm talking about do you
 
01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.110 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm talking about do you

04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh good question uh so um it it's not
 
04:01:16.750 --> 04:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
very not exactly clear at least to me
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
what happened in the Senate um the
 
04:01:21.790 --> 04:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
department wasn't
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
um other than being um at the initial
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on the the bill uh to increase
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill to increase benefits
 
04:01:33.510 --> 04:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
which was much different than the
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
amended version we didn't have much
 
04:01:40.550 --> 04:01:40.560 align:start position:0%
involvement after that uh so unlike with
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
House labor where we had a lengthy
 
04:01:45.309 --> 04:01:45.319 align:start position:0%
hearing ing a lot of questions were
 
04:01:47.790 --> 04:01:47.800 align:start position:0%
asked and a lot of information was
 
04:01:51.590 --> 04:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
provided with regards to how the current
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
U pay Matrix works for eligibility for
 
04:01:57.429 --> 04:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment and how much you have to
 
04:01:59.309 --> 04:01:59.319 align:start position:0%
earn in order to be eligible for each
 
04:02:01.469 --> 04:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount and the impact
 
04:02:04.149 --> 04:02:04.159 align:start position:0%
that the proposals would have we didn't
 
04:02:06.269 --> 04:02:06.279 align:start position:0%
really have that opportunity in the
 
04:02:10.469 --> 04:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
Senate um so um we did have a
 
04:02:12.309 --> 04:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
conversation with with the sponsor
 
04:02:15.469 --> 04:02:15.479 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka and um you know
 
04:02:17.149 --> 04:02:17.159 align:start position:0%
she was optimistic that maybe something
 
04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to be done in the next
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
session uh but there seemed to be quite
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
a bit of resistance to um doing anything
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
with with benefits in in this session
 
04:02:30.510 --> 04:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
but again I don't know the specifics of
 
04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.229 --> 04:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:43.920 --> 04:03:53.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:00.149 --> 04:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:04.070 --> 04:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
yester the amount of money
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
state has to pay
 
04:04:21.389 --> 04:04:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
and I I was able to run those numbers if
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
you want me to quickly go over them and
 
04:04:28.429 --> 04:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
I don't I'm I'm not I'm not certain what
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
the threshold is but I do know from um a
 
04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
like a a pure fiscal note perspective
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
and looking at impact to State and
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal uh spending uh the state as an
 
04:04:46.469 --> 04:04:46.479 align:start position:0%
employer when we looked at 2023 there
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
were um just over
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
$142,000 in unemployment benefits paid
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
to former state employees so executive
 
04:04:58.830 --> 04:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
legislative judicial that does not
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
include the university system that does
 
04:05:02.670 --> 04:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
not include the community college system
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
it's just the three branches of
 
04:05:10.229 --> 04:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
government um when we had looked at the
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
impact that the Senate proposal would
 
04:05:13.359 --> 04:05:14.469 align:start position:0%
impact that the Senate proposal would
have

04:05:14.469 --> 04:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:05:17.110 --> 04:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
to existing benefit payments that was an
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
increase of
 
04:05:23.149 --> 04:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
26% overall so if you took 26% of what
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
was paid out um to the state's former
 
04:05:30.750 --> 04:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
employees in 2023 that would be about um
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
just shy of a
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
$37,000 increase I think that exceeds
 
04:05:38.910 --> 04:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
the the thresholds that people were
 
04:05:38.920 --> 04:05:42.630 align:start position:0%
the the thresholds that people were
talking

04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
about correct that does not include
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
no doubt that
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
um so the the both proposals is amended
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
both of them increase the amount of
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
benefits going out right so that in and
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
of itself has an impact on an employer's
 
04:07:33.309 --> 04:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
experience rating so when you increase
 
04:07:35.990 --> 04:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of benefits we use that to
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
calculate what their experience is their
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
experience translates into a rate at
 
04:07:43.590 --> 04:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
which they pay when we look at the fun
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
balance reduction thresholds which
 
04:07:47.590 --> 04:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
determin when an employer gets
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
reductions to their earned rate the
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
proposed bill would not have an impact
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
um on those um because the the Senate
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
proposal um does seek to raise the fund
 
04:08:04.229 --> 04:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
balance uh reduction thresholds
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
currently it's at 250 million uh 350 and
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
400 million to get the Half Point full
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
point point and a half reduction
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate proposal would increase that
 
04:08:17.560 --> 04:08:20.630 align:start position:0%
the Senate proposal would increase that
to

04:08:20.630 --> 04:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have it right
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
here the the Senate proposal would go so
 
04:08:32.429 --> 04:08:32.439 align:start position:0%
instead of 250 350 400 it would go 300
 
04:08:32.439 --> 04:08:34.910 align:start position:0%
instead of 250 350 400 it would go 300
375

04:08:34.910 --> 04:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
375
 
04:08:38.790 --> 04:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
450 and that change in and of itself
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
would not have an impact on employers uh
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
tax rates from the perspective
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
perspective of what they're forecasted
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
to get for a fund balance reduction for
 
04:08:51.750 --> 04:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.950 --> 04:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
2025 and that's due to the current
 
04:08:55.830 --> 04:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
balance of the trust fund being you know
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
we we're hovering right now around 400
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
million um and so what we're forecasting
 
04:09:03.309 --> 04:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
the fund to
 
04:09:07.030 --> 04:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
maintain um is basically a continuation
 
04:09:11.189 --> 04:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
of a 1% reduction and the proposal in
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the senate in those threshold s and what
 
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
the forecasted balances are to be would
 
04:09:25.870 --> 04:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
that uh point I want to say
 
04:09:34.189 --> 04:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.229 --> 04:09:41.239 align:start position:0%
to First 14 so uh we are at as of Q3 of
 
04:09:45.429 --> 04:09:45.439 align:start position:0%
2023 average uh um experience rated
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
employer was at
 
04:09:50.429 --> 04:09:50.439 align:start position:0%
.57 uh that is lower than where they
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
were prior to the
 
04:09:55.830 --> 04:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's probably
 
04:09:59.510 --> 04:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
top uh bottom three bottom five in terms
 
04:10:22.149 --> 04:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:22.159 --> 04:11:11.830 align:start position:0%
 
B

04:11:11.830 --> 04:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.840 --> 04:11:39.830 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the house version would have a
 
04:11:42.560 --> 04:11:44.030 align:start position:0%
uh the the house version would have a
higher

04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
in would cause a higher increase in
 
04:11:48.070 --> 04:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
benefits but they're they're close right
 
04:11:51.750 --> 04:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
with single digit percentages apart so
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
the house bill 1522 is amended would be
 
04:12:00.229 --> 04:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
a 32% increase in payouts looking at
 
04:12:04.030 --> 04:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
2023 experience and uh the Senate bill
 
04:12:05.950 --> 04:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
as amended would be a
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
26% increase in looking at the same
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:16.920 --> 04:12:18.710 align:start position:0%
 
we're

04:12:18.710 --> 04:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
talking 6
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
million uh for the Senate and third and
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh 9 million for the house version the
 
04:12:31.030 --> 04:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
the reason for that and I can confirm
 
04:12:34.950 --> 04:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
those amounts the reason for that is the
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
Senate version adds new tiers but it
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
does not increase the existing
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
tiers the house version increases the
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:42.720 --> 04:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
 
just

04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
the difference between them um the the
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
number the the raw dollars I wasn't
 
04:13:53.510 --> 04:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
certain of so the Senate Amendment would
 
04:13:56.269 --> 04:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
cause an increase of 6.8 million which
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
was a 26% increase over what was paid
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
out in
 
04:14:04.349 --> 04:14:04.359 align:start position:0%
2023 the house bill 1522 with the
 
04:14:08.710 --> 04:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment would cause an 8.4 almost $8.5
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
million increase which was a
 
04:14:14.750 --> 04:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
33% change over what was paid out
 
04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
however the house version the amendment
 
04:14:20.550 --> 04:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
did stagger that implementation over 3
 
04:14:23.630 --> 04:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
years so and the way that it did that
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
was it introduced the new benefit tiers
 
04:14:30.670 --> 04:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
gradually over each of those three so
 
04:14:33.309 --> 04:14:33.319 align:start position:0%
then in the first year was an 18%
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
increase the second year was a 27%
 
04:14:38.830 --> 04:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
increase and then in the the third year
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
Allin and going forward was a 33% not in
 
04:14:47.469 --> 04:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
addition to the 27 but 6% more so fully
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
baked it was a
 
04:14:52.870 --> 04:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
33% increase and again the reason for
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
that um was with the adjustment that the
 
04:15:23.790 --> 04:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:23.800 --> 04:16:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:10.630 --> 04:16:10.640 align:start position:0%
my motion the motion should be that we
 
04:16:30.510 --> 04:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I think I have
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at 202
 
04:16:36.319 --> 04:16:41.189 align:start position:0%
uh I'm looking at 202
24-5

04:16:41.189 --> 04:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:47.429 --> 04:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.199 --> 04:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
go

04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.880 --> 04:19:07.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
function no I I don't think so because
 
04:19:13.109 --> 04:19:13.119 align:start position:0%
of the the language that the Senate
 
04:19:15.630 --> 04:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
included that allows the department
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
to um conduct rulemaking to make sure
 
04:19:22.910 --> 04:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
that in the instances that uh someone is
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to exclusively look for remote
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
work and continue to be eligible it's
 
04:19:30.309 --> 04:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
going to be in an industry that offers a
 
04:19:32.510 --> 04:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of remote work
 
04:19:36.510 --> 04:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities so our concern was not
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
that remote work is is some sort of fad
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
and it's it's going to go away it's very
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
much here to stay
 
04:19:46.950 --> 04:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
but for over half of the New Hampshire
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce which is comprised of service
 
04:19:51.710 --> 04:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
related Industries such as health care
 
04:19:54.510 --> 04:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing construction retail
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hospitality someone coming out of that
 
04:19:59.389 --> 04:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
industry filing for unemployment and
 
04:20:01.309 --> 04:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
looking for work in that industry if
 
04:20:03.149 --> 04:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
they were to limit themselves to remote
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
work that would not be uh u a real
 
04:20:10.149 --> 04:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
adequate work search when that's not a a
 
04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
very um um abundant
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity within those sectors so we
 
04:20:18.510 --> 04:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
want the ability to Define that and have
 
04:20:19.870 --> 04:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
you know make sure that when you're
 
04:20:22.950 --> 04:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
looking exclusively for remote work that
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
it's within an industry that offers a
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of remote work
 
04:20:26.840 --> 04:21:08.790 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of remote work
opportunity

04:21:08.790 --> 04:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:10.950 --> 04:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
um the bill doesn't get into that the
 
04:21:15.070 --> 04:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
the the language which um it cleans up
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
the statute this is this was a a piece
 
04:21:21.750 --> 04:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
of uh statute that originated back to
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
the Social Security Act um so what we
 
04:21:27.269 --> 04:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
put in here was an individual should not
 
04:21:29.189 --> 04:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
be eligible if they're limiting
 
04:21:31.710 --> 04:21:31.720 align:start position:0%
themselves to work within the home
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
unless work to be conducted within the
 
04:21:37.870 --> 04:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
individual individual's home offers a
 
04:21:40.670 --> 04:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectation of substantial
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities based upon
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
