00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
i i'll try to meet with the leadership
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
today in regard to when we can determine
 
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
when we might have that week off that
 
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
we've been talk i've been talking about
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
i've been aiming all along for the week
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's in conjunction with the week off
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
down in the southern part of the state
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
here with schools i think that's the
 
00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
28th going forward
 
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:31.510 align:start position:0%
28th going forward
um

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
also that means we're going to have to
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
really do a lot of exacting bills uh
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
judiciary the other day
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
exact 41 bills in one day
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
it can be done if we work together and
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
try to get things done but that's in
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
education that would be kind of like
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't go to the bet on any of
 
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.670 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't go to the bet on any of
that

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
i i would think that we'd be lucky to
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
get half of what they got done
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
and but we're going to certainly give it
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
a shot along the way here so today we
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
that uh representative ford uh provided
 
00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
us over there if we're gonna be talking
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%

the fact that that that he indicated to
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
all of all of our members that he had
 
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
tested covered positive so we should not
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
be indicating any specific person here
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
in in public well he he did it he did i
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
know he's done it but i don't want us to
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
be doing it here on the committee level
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's fine
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that um
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
but uh what what we're unclear about is
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
is if such notification one such
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
notification happens
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
uh what uh what that does to our
 
00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.550 align:start position:0%
uh what uh what that does to our
protocol

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
protocol
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
for both members of the committee as
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
well as guests
 
00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
as far as as far as covid mitigation
 
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay i think what you need to do is take
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
that up with your leadership and they
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
can take up a leadership as this a
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
hearing we've got to move forward right
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%

honorable members of this committee
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
i introduce hb 1638
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
which seeks to change the grievance
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
procedure for violations of the right to
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
freedom from discrimination
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
in education
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
the proposed bill is simple
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
it aims to keep the grievance procedure
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
within the local school administrative
 
00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
within the local school administrative
unit

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
a person agreed by an act made unlawful
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
by this sub division shall file a
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
written complaint to the district
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the sau
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
the petitioner would complete the public
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
education intake
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
form found on the department of
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
education website
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
the sa youth superintendent will use
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
this information to determine whether
 
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.590 align:start position:0%
this information to determine whether
the

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
petitioner has the basis to file a
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
formal charge after reviewing the
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
questionnaire the sau superintendent
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
will contact the aggrieved party to
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
gather further information
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
and as necessary
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
either explain
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
the next steps in filing a formal charge
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
or explain why
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
the person does not have a basis to file
 
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
a charge of discrimination
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
i believe that the local school district
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
should be in charge of the investigation
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
they are the head administrator of the
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
school district and have knowledge of
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the teachers the parents and the
 
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.190 align:start position:0%
the teachers the parents and the
students

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
we need to trust that local
 
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.150 align:start position:0%
we need to trust that local
administrators

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
will complete a thorough investigation
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
and will without prejudice decide on
 
00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:40.870 align:start position:0%
and will without prejudice decide on
whether

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the basis of the complaint has merit
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
this process is simple
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
quick and cheap
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
and the end result could be a learning
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
process for all involved
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
now if the aggrieved party disagrees
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
with the sau's finding they may appeal
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire department of
 
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.230 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire department of
education

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
looking at line five
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
proposal yes and i'm just concerned
 
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
about the three days receipt time
 
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.430 align:start position:0%
about the three days receipt time
where

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stipulate school days
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
comes in on friday
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
lack of time will make money they really
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
won't be a legitimate
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
time you repeat that i'm sorry sure um
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm because on line five i'm concerned
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
the time frame okay you have three days
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
after we see the complaint right but if
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
a complaint comes in on a thursday or
 
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.550 align:start position:0%
a complaint comes in on a thursday or
friday

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
friday
 
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's monday the weekend's all gone
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
that's just three days so it doesn't
 
00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839 align:start position:0%
stipulate school days or business days
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's just like i'm raising that
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
question was the reason that you omitted
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
question was the reason that you omitted
that

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.670 align:start position:0%
that
no

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.470 align:start position:0%
no
um

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
it wasn't intentional um
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
to leave out
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's business days or
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
school days but it makes sense that it
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
would be uh school days okay thank you

them succeed in higher education

01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
them to civil
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
liability for
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh engaging in any form of instruction
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering because um i
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts bill
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
actually worked with the department of
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
education to take teachers credentials
 
01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
away and i was just wondering if the
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
civil liability
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh would matter at that point
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
if it's uh through the department of
 
01:06:49.599 --> 01:06:51.670 align:start position:0%
if it's uh through the department of
education

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:06:53.829 --> 01:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh the the repercussions for the person
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the question okay i'm
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
trying let me see if i i'm getting you
 
01:07:07.109 --> 01:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
correctly um you're asking if
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
you're asking about specific liabilities
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
would that be before or after
 
01:07:12.079 --> 01:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
would that be before or after
um

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
a educator has been um
 
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
a educator has been um
disciplined

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
disciplined
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
right in other in other words i i think
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
and i'm not positive about this but i
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:26.480 align:start position:0%
part of the penalties for teaching um
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
the concepts that they feel would
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know be divisive um
 
01:07:34.230 --> 01:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
result in a penalty for
 
01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.190 align:start position:0%
result in a penalty for
uh

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
education in the from the department of
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
education perhaps losing your credential
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
or something like that
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
and in here you don't mention that but
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:45.910 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
um

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
subjecting them to civil liability and
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm not familiar with that term
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not a lawyer so uh i don't
 
01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.029 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not a lawyer so uh i don't
know

01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
how wide of a
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
apron or umbrella that is in protection
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm that's what i'm asking oh okay
 
01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
and i'm that's what i'm asking oh okay
um

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i really don't know thank
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative lakis
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes i'm curious
 
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it says and i've been trying to
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
finish looking this up but at any rate
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
it says engaging in any form of
 
01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
it says engaging in any form of
instruction

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
concerning etc
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what if the form of
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
i am not sure um
 
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
would be curious to know um
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
who would be making the decision that
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
who

01:08:57.030 --> 01:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
generally makes the decision whether
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.189 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
i think i need to rephrase that repraise
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
considering whether a
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
an action is discriminatory um
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
but i i don't understand in whose eyes
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the eyes of the law and the eyes of
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
um well according to that's what i was
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
trying to look up i usually do it fast
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
on my phone so that i would have it in
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
front of me but it's much slower
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
this way
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
i was trying to look up the applicable
 
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
i was trying to look up the applicable
law

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
so i could see exactly what the the
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
wording was but
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
when you say any form of instruction and
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons some of these things
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
have been instituted is because the
 
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
have been instituted is because the
students

01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
or the students and parents find the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
form of instruction to be discriminatory
 
01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
and feel discriminated against
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
and would then want to be able to
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
ask that that not be
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
done and that's why i was trying to
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
look up the exact wording but at any
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
rate the object when people object it's
 
01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
generally because the instruction is
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and they do feel
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
discriminated against
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so this any form of instruction
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
putting it into the discrimination in
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
public schools sort of undoes
 
01:10:40.149 --> 01:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
that whole
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
chapter in
 
01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:43.590 align:start position:0%
chapter in
um

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
hang on
 
01:10:46.030 --> 01:10:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill doesn't say any form of
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
instruction you got to read it in
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
context engaging in any form of
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
instruction concerning the historical or
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
current experiences of any group it
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop at any form of instruction
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't know where this line of
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
question is actually
 
01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.709 align:start position:0%
question is actually
um

01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
could you ask a question of the
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative testifying
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
well i was i was wondering how if
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
i mean it's supposed to
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
that's protected from discrimination and
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
if the form of instruction itself is
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
the group that is protected whoever that
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
is which is a huge group based on age
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
sex you know the the list is very long
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
all the things
 
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
all the things
and

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that by saying
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
engaging in any form of
 
01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
instruction concerning current
 
01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
experiences of any group that's
 
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
protected from discrimination
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
by saying it that way you're almost
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
saying you're almost
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
negating the law against discrimination
 
01:11:59.229 --> 01:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
because the form of instruction can be
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in and of itself and so
 
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.470 align:start position:0%
discriminatory in and of itself and so
that's

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
at any rate that was
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
it had there was a
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'd had to ask a question yes okay i
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
think your question is speculative and
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm having a really hard time giving you
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
an answer um
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i will um
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman cordelie
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
thank you again for being here this
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
morning and uh
 
01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
taking taking my question i'm looking at
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the line that was just referenced by
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative leakes and
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
further uh uh
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
explained by representative luno
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
is it the intent of this line i'm
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
talking about six and seven
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
basically saying that i just wanna make
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
sure i'm on the same
 
01:12:49.679 --> 01:12:50.950 align:start position:0%
sure i'm on the same
understanding

01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:52.470 align:start position:0%
understanding
that

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
teachers are going to be allowed to
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
teach whatever is correct
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
in in historical context as we now know
 
01:12:58.719 --> 01:12:59.350 align:start position:0%
in in historical context as we now know
it

01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh and they will then be
 
01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh and they will then be
uh

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
will be prohibited
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
from being sued for teaching the
 
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.640 align:start position:0%
historical information as it exists is
 
01:13:10.149 --> 01:13:10.159 align:start position:0%

would you agree that maybe it's up to
 
01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:24.229 align:start position:0%
would you agree that maybe it's up to
the

01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
administration in the school to
 
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
determine some of these kinds of things
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
that they're the ones that are on site
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that can walk in and
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
supervise the teacher they can witness
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%

materials
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
that they are the impartial people that
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%

administration in the school to address
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%

all students are ready to succeed
 
01:14:57.990 --> 01:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
nda new hampshire has held from the
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
beginning that the current laws of
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
vagueness would have a chilling effect
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
on educators throughout the state
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
after seeing the law in action this year
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
so far our members are students we know
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
that this is true
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
after this law was passed last year nea
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire made multiple requests for
 
01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
specific guidance and instruction to
 
01:15:16.709 --> 01:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
assist educators in staying within the
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
new law these requests were sent to both
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
the department of education and the
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to this day
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
the requests have gone unanswered
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's consistently ranked as
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard before in the top three or
 
01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:28.630 align:start position:0%
we've heard before in the top three or
four

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
states with regard to public education
 
01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
our students and our state lose if
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to constructively address
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
race in our classrooms are muzzled and
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
criminalized by this law that's vague on
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently we have educators feeling as
 
01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
they cannot allow students to dialogue
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
with each other to peer review each
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
other's work orderly let students lead
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
classroom discussions because they don't
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
know if student driven learning will
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
lead to a discussion that could be
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
interpreted as the instruction of a
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
banned concept
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
the law's broad use of the word teach
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
dissuades teachers from presenting
 
01:16:10.229 --> 01:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
material as a jumping off point for
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
discussion lest they be accused of
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
indoctrinating students simply because
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
they expose them to one author's thesis
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
our teachers are feeling that they must
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
now teach material in a vacuum in order
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
to limit analogy students may draw to
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
current events that could address one or
 
01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
more of the band concepts they're
 
01:16:27.189 --> 01:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
hesitant to ask questions like does what
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
we just read or saw apply in your life
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
where do you see this happening now
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're concerned about opening up
 
01:16:33.910 --> 01:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
discussions like that because it might
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
veer into banned concepts
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
teachers believe that students are
 
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged by the law because they're
 
01:16:40.630 --> 01:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
not being given the opportunity to form
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
their own opinions or perspectives on
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
important social and historical issues
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
they're not developing analytical skills
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
to support any opinion that they could
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
form if they're not permitted to engage
 
01:16:52.149 --> 01:16:52.159 align:start position:0%
in a discussion with peers or teachers
 
01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:54.320 align:start position:0%
about authors failings misunderstandings
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
or flawed reasonings
 
01:16:57.750 --> 01:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
while ignoring our request for clarity
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the new law the department of
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
education installed public mechanisms
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
for reporting educator non-compliance
 
01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
and procedures to take away teaching
 
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
credentials prompting what we believe is
 
01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
the first bounty ever offered on an
 
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.590 align:start position:0%
the first bounty ever offered on an
educator

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
educator
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
teachers believe that false reports of
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
violations of the act would be extremely
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
damaging as they would cause unnecessary
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
controversy and attention up to and
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
including reports of the department to
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
disciplinary referrals an investigation
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
by the school district not to mention
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
the harassment unwanted attention via
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
social media and news coverage to that
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
end educators are either declining to
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
use permissible works altogether or
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
removing controversial authors names
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
from the materials prior to presenting
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
them to students
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
the chilling effect of the band concept
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
act is that new hampshire educators are
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
now weighing meeting state standards
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
against losing their license in their
 
01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.310 align:start position:0%
against losing their license in their
livelihoods

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
livelihoods
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
parents and teachers want to provide our
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
children the best education they can but
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
the band concept act has created an
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
environment that limits the context in
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
which kids can learn about history and
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
what books they can read
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
we should be trusting educators and
 
01:17:59.189 --> 01:17:59.199 align:start position:0%
parents to ensure our kids are getting
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
the best education possible
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
teachers are trained and experienced in
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
education have a duty to set their
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
students up to be successful
 
01:18:08.630 --> 01:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
contributors to society educators should
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
have the freedom to teach the honest
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
complete facts about historical events
 
01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
like slavery and civil rights without
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
being censored and having their licenses
 
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
and livelihoods being put at risk by a
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
vague law
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1090 restores the ability to
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
provide diverse educational approaches
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%

to meet students needs
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
our students deserve the freedom to
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
learn they deserve to be part of an
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
education that helps them learn from
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
mistakes of the past so they're better
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
prepared to succeed
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
to inhibit new hampshire's public school
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
educators from engaging in the kinds of
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
discussions that help teach and
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
challenge students to use this knowledge
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
to form their own opinion is a
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
disservice to them and to the state of
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire on behalf of any in new

pass i do have written testimony i'll
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
pass in that has some more specific
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
examples but i didn't want to take up
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
much more time
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you i understand that to
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
did you receive or find the information
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
that the doe put out after this was done
 
01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
they have a huge
 
01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.229 align:start position:0%
they have a huge
um

01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
like a brochure almost and it's on their
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
website that has all of those things
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
that you were asking for and it
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
specifically says that they can teach
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
all these things etc
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering you said you keep asking
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
from for guidance and they posted this
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
huge guidance but you said you didn't
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
get any help and i'm wondering have you
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
seen that thank you for the question yes
 
01:19:37.510 --> 01:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
we sent a letter to the department of ed
 
01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
in the attorney general's office once
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
this was first signed and we asked for
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
for specific books
 
01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.110 align:start position:0%
for specific books
lessons

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
lessons
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
topics etc
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
right after we sent that and i don't
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
think it was because we sent it but
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
right after we sent it the frequently
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
asked questions and guidance came out
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general's office we
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
did see that we then sent another one
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
asking for more specificity in it
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
because there still were not any
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
specific books etc that were going
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
against it and the law is still
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
extremely vague we still haven't
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
received answers to that so i have seen
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
if it's the same document that you're
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
speaking of
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
i have seen that but i think it could
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
have been a little more specific in
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
answering the questions that we asked
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
that were specific i can provide our
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
request to you if you'd like i'm more
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
than happy to share it i
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm glad you saw it i
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
think they don't want i think they're
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
trying to allow flexibility
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
um by not
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
giving specifics but
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you thank you
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative moffat

thank you mr thank you for being here uh
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
i counted five times in your testimony
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
where you use the expression band
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
concepts can can you give us an example
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
or sample of a band concept um thank you
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
for the question i can't because there
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
really is no specific things the law is
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
so vague that there really is nothing
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
specific for it i could have said
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts or other words but
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
band concepts is just what we're using
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
in the current statute that you take
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you the whole statute
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%

01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
any situations in the state where
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
a teacher has
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
had parents a
 
01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
had parents a
principal

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
principal
 
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
object under 193.40 for something
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
they've done or or proposed to do in the
 
01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
classroom are you aware of any
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
situations like that thank you for the
 
01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
question um i do have some examples in
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the written testimony that are in the
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit also that we filed that i'll be
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
turning into you so you can see those
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
there are specific um
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'd have to i have to go back and look
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
but i know that there are
 
01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
educators in some of the different
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
counties i believe it was in
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county where they had
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
curriculum that was
 
01:22:00.790 --> 01:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
prepared by both the educators and the
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
administration on certain books
 
01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
i believe it was either beloved or
 
01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
stamped from the beginning the kids
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
version of it
 
01:22:10.149 --> 01:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
where everything had been approved and
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
then because the law was put into place
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
um that was stopped because of the
 
01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
vagueness of it and they weren't sure if
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
it was going to be allowed um there is
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
an instance in the in the written
 
01:22:21.189 --> 01:22:21.199 align:start position:0%
testimony where a parent had complained
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
about something and so it was stopped um
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's so there are other
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
examples in there for you thank you
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
for the questions uh representative
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman quinnelly
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
i have
 
01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.470 align:start position:0%
i have
two

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
miss most uh masato thank you so much
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
for being here and taking my two
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
questions hopefully um i'm looking at
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
both extremes of teaching from a
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
historical context
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how
 
01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.229 align:start position:0%
can you tell me how
our

01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
current teaching staff i think you were
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
middle school if i recall correct
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
historically talk at one point how they
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
would go about teaching history if they
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
can't teach the entirety of history
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question yes i
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
taught um eighth grade social studies us
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
history for 18 years
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
and i i think they're not teaching it
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
right now i think that's the problem is
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
because the the law is so vague it's
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
educators are worried that they're going
 
01:23:15.270 --> 01:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
to be accused of indoctrinating or
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
saying something that is taken out of
 
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
saying something that is taken out of
context

01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
and then the possibility of them losing
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
their license is on the line that's a
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
really very real possibility because of
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of the law so
 
01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:26.790 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of the law so
um

01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
i i think it's i know it's having a
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the teaching of
 
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
history and things you know things like
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
critical thinking having student-led
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
discussions where they can ask how does
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
this apply to your life um things like
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
that are not being done and i know that
 
01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
for a fact because the educators are
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
telling me they're not doing that
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
anymore okay
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman the last one um on
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
the far other end of the spectrum when
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
you get to the high school level
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
particularly the ap history classes and
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
which typically have been very uh
 
01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.709 align:start position:0%
which typically have been very uh
socratic

01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
socratic
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
and and followed up by detailed detailed
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
resources et cetera et cetera
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
those classes because the upper level
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
are they still going on or is it
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
something's halted there um thank you
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
for the question the the classes are
 
01:24:08.870 --> 01:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.110 align:start position:0%
going on
um

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
yeah no i i do have some other examples
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
in here for you about ap um i'm just
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
trying to find it in the testimony in
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
the testimony i have it yeah about um ap
 
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
i apologize it's not in the
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
ap english at a public high school in
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county um reports that
 
01:24:27.510 --> 01:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
since this law is packed they've stopped
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
bringing his class to life by relating
 
01:24:30.390 --> 01:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
materials to current events or to
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
students own experiences which is a
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
common teaching tool educators concerned
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
prompting a discussion related to
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
current events is going to risk
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation the edu that the
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
educators indoctrinating students about
 
01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
the viewpoints of those involved these
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
are examples from actual you know
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
educators in new hampshire are still
 
01:24:48.229 --> 01:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
teaching um that are in our lawsuit as
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
well so these are these are happening
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
one more this last one guarantee
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
it was a while ago when i was in the
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
classroom but at that point in time ap
 
01:25:03.270 --> 01:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
curricula was prescriptive from the ap
 
01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.550 align:start position:0%
curricula was prescriptive from the ap
association

01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh two parts of this one question is it
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
still is there still is it still
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
prescriptive and are we following the
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
prescription um thank you for the
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
question that is a great question i
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
honestly would have to check on that i'm
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's still prescriptive or
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
not um but i don't want to answer
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so i would i can check on
 
01:25:22.470 --> 01:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
that and get back to you thank you so
 
01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
much thank you chairman for your legacy
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're welcome um
 
01:25:30.629 --> 01:25:30.639 align:start position:0%
i would just like to ask one question um
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think you mentioned something about
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
was it removing authors names before
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
presenting the material to the students
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
i didn't catch
 
01:25:42.229 --> 01:25:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh what was being removed before
 
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
presenting to students
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
or is that maybe that's in your written
 
01:25:47.669 --> 01:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you for the question i
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
think i was talking about just removing
 
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.629 align:start position:0%
think i was talking about just removing
authors

01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
authors
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and maybe their viewpoints from it
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i actually said an
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
author's name i know they were removing
 
01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.350 align:start position:0%
author's name i know they were removing
books

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:57.360 align:start position:0%
books
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
because the possibility of
 
01:26:01.669 --> 01:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
controversy for it and i do have the
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
books listed in the written testimony
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
the question i am aware that the
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
department of education has contacted
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%

megan are in touch with other executive
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%

throughout the country
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts issue uh
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
unique to new hampshire or is it being
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
discussed in other locations as well
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%

presidents executive directors um etc
 
01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
and it is um there is talk of this all
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
over the country i think new hampshire
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
from what i've seen has one of the
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
most vague laws
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
but it is being talked about
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of other places
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
thank you

um
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
my follow-up question
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
conversations that i've had myself with
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
teachers who have reached out over the
 
01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
teachers who have reached out over the
past

01:27:35.510 --> 01:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
in your discussions with people in new
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire or even in other locales
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
have you
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
had anybody address with you the idea of
 
01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
feeling discriminated against themselves
 
01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
by their situation not being allowed in
 
01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.510 align:start position:0%
by their situation not being allowed in
discussion

01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:28:01.350 --> 01:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think for the question yeah the the
 
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
feeling that i'm getting in talking to
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
educators and talking to other
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
local affiliates etc is
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
there's just really this feeling of
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
being attacked for teaching what is on
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
it or you know the fact that they just
 
01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
want to teach honest history and be in
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
the classroom to teach that's what they
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
went to school for that's what they're
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
professionals at and
 
01:28:24.470 --> 01:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
there's just this this it's
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
disheartening there's a lot of people
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
who are just fed up and wanting to leave
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
the profession at this point for a lot
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
of different reasons and this is part of
 
01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.390 align:start position:0%
of different reasons and this is part of
it

01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
representative ellis uh thank you mr
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
chair um taking representative porter's
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
question one step further do you think
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate for
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
personnel or the department of education
 
01:28:46.629 --> 01:28:46.639 align:start position:0%
to be contacting individual teachers
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
about what they're teaching in their
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
classroom um thank you for the question
 
01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
i personally speaking i don't think it's
 
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate i think there are other ways
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
to go about that and i think there are
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
processes in place that should be
 
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.350 align:start position:0%
processes in place that should be
followed

01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
followed
 
01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.390 align:start position:0%
followed
to

01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:29:00.950 --> 01:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
talk to a teacher or somebody else about
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
complaints against them thank you
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%

lakis
 
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes i had the law in front of me and i
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
keep hearing this teachers can't teach
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
anything teachers can't teach anything
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid because the law
 
01:29:20.070 --> 01:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
is vague and so
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
if you can explain to me
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
what is vague if i go through
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
line by you know section by section
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
is it vague
 
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
one person's
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics because i'm not going to
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
basically teachers aren't supposed to
 
01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:44.629 align:start position:0%
basically teachers aren't supposed to
teach

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
teach
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
that one's
 
01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.189 align:start position:0%
that one's
characteristics

01:29:51.189 --> 01:29:51.199 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
are inherently superior to any others
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
is that vague
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
the thank you for the question the issue
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
comes in where educators are afraid to
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
talk about almost anything now this is
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing from them in the
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
classrooms because of the fear of being
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted and if they're
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted and then everything is
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
investigated and it goes down the
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
process that's laid out their livelihood
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
could be done their licenses could be
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
taken away this is what they're telling
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
me we asked for specifics um from the
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
department of education the attorney
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
general's office can we teach um you
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
know beloved or stamps from the
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
beginning or there are some other
 
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
examples that are in the written
 
01:30:30.149 --> 01:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
testimony and that can't be answered it
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't been answered the answers we're
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
getting are even
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes do those
 
01:30:37.679 --> 01:30:38.629 align:start position:0%
yes do those
um

01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:40.709 --> 01:30:40.719 align:start position:0%
things that you're talking about
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
do they try to teach that one
 
01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
let's say race age whatever is better
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
than another ace or rage i don't believe
 
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
that's what they're teaching or trying
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
to well then i don't understand what the
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
question is i'm trying to understand
 
01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
what the issue is that teachers are
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
afraid to teach based on what i thought
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
was a very specific
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
law and you keep saying it's general
 
01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to improve it
 
01:31:09.750 --> 01:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
what it is that's general what it is
 
01:31:13.830 --> 01:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's misunderstood it even says
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in this section
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
shall be construed to prohibit
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
discussing as part of a larger course of
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
academic instruction the historical
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
existence of ideas and subjects
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
identified in this section so it
 
01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
specifically says they can talk about
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
these things it just says they can't
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
push them they can't advocate for them
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the things that they
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
express what my question is so she can
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
answer because i'm not understanding
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
what is vague
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
what where the breakdown is that's what
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find where is the
 
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
breakdown between this language and what
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't know how else i can answer
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
besides what i've already said okay
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
agree disgrace thank you thank you
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
though for trying
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
represent tanner
 
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you agree that
 
01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.110 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you agree that
discrimination

01:32:15.110 --> 01:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh is in the eye of the beholder that um
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
if you're in a protected group
 
01:32:20.159 --> 01:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
if you're in a protected group
uh

01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not in that protected
 
01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.629 align:start position:0%
somebody who is not in that protected
group

01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
might say something that
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh you might feel is discriminatory
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
towards you and they may not so
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's do you think that this
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
this bill puts that if if that's true
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
that it's in the eye of the beholder
 
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:40.950 align:start position:0%
that it's in the eye of the beholder
then

01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
you have 25 students in your class
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
beholding what you're teaching
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
who might take offense to it is that is
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
that what most teachers are afraid of
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question yeah i think
 
01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:54.719 align:start position:0%
you know that's it the fear is that
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
something is
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
you might not be teaching or you're not
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
teaching that you are inheritly you know
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
superior or inferior anything but the
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
perception of what you said is taken out
 
01:33:07.110 --> 01:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
of context or taken misinterpreted and
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
that can lead to losing your license
 
01:33:13.110 --> 01:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes quickly please
 
01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:15.030 align:start position:0%
yes quickly please
so

01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
can it also be a misconception
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
by a student that a teacher is
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
inculcating or
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
forcing or advocating their position on
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it could be yes thank
 
01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i think it could be yes thank
you

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you megan
 
01:33:37.110 --> 01:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
for taking another question i'm going to
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
just bring you back to my teaching
 
01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
career i've been out of the classroom
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
i taught second grade
 
01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.189 align:start position:0%
i taught second grade
and

01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
when it got to be thanksgiving time it
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
was always
 
01:33:51.430 --> 01:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a problem to me of how
 
01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
to teach about the first thanksgiving
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
i knew it was a
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
tradition to teach it one way but i also
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
knew that there were
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
other things that might
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
that were not taught when i was a kid
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
that maybe the kids needed to know so as
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
i addressed that issue with them i told
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
them about how europeans came over
 
01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
that native americans were already here
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the europeans settled on the land
 
01:34:19.830 --> 01:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
that belonged to the native americans
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
many of the native americans afterwards
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
got sick and died and that um eventually
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the europeans
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
took the land that belonged to the
 
01:34:32.790 --> 01:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
native americans so that when we went
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
through how that would work and
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
i would ask the children at that time
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
how do you think that what do you think
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
about that how does that make you feel
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and without the
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
question those second graders would say
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
i feel really bad for the native
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
americans they took away their land is
 
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.310 align:start position:0%
americans they took away their land is
there

01:34:50.310 --> 01:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
under this yes sir there is under the
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
concepts of this law
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
allowed do you think or would i still be
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
able to do that kind of teaching in
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
second grade now
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
if this law was in place
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so the current law in place um
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
what i am hearing from the educators is
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
they are not asking those questions
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
because they are
 
01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:14.390 align:start position:0%
because they are
afraid

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
afraid
 
01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.189 align:start position:0%
afraid
of

01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
what is going to come out of it so in
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
go through an entire explanation
 
01:35:23.199 --> 01:35:25.910 align:start position:0%
go through an entire explanation
of

01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
both sides i guess which
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do they're just
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
avoiding the topics altogether they're
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
just avoiding it because of what the
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
consequences could be to this so this
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
would take that completely out and
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
let the educators go back to teaching
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next is uh jill's
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
repton of tanner
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
um do you think that this bill not not
 
01:35:59.669 --> 01:35:59.679 align:start position:0%
the bill we're talking about but the
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
repeal repeal bill
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
is like
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps having
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
a law for
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
how fast to go on the interstate highway
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the law says just be safe
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then you go what you want to on the
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
interstate highway and all of a sudden
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
you see the blue lights behind you
 
01:36:18.950 --> 01:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
and they pull you over and they say you
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
weren't safe
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
would that be an analogy to how teachers
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
feel about teaching this in in public
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
schools thank you i think it could be
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know 10 build or i'm sorry 10 bill
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1090 would just get rid of
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
what's there so it would
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
be a good thing in our eyes
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative moffatt thank you
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
 
01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:41.189 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
question

01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:43.830 --> 01:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
what would you do in a situation where a
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher an educator is flat
 
01:36:46.159 --> 01:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher an educator is flat
out

01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
out
teaching

01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
wrong information facts that are wrong
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
dates that are wrong that happens i give
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
you examples so my question again is
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
when a teacher is factually incorrect uh
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
what should be done
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
um honestly thank you for the question i
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
think that's really needs to go through
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
the school first go through
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
administration first before it goes
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's up to the principal to deal
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
with it at the first
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
much i did try to wipe but there's no
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
okay quickly please
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
my question is as i asked earlier what
 
01:37:34.950 --> 01:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
if it's the school administration that
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
is the one that's pushing the
 
01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:38.310 align:start position:0%
is the one that's pushing the
discriminatory

01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
01:37:40.629 --> 01:37:40.639 align:start position:0%
um teaching
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
what do you mean by pushing the
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
discriminatory teaching that the
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
administration i'm just trying to
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
clarify your question that the
 
01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.109 align:start position:0%
clarify your question that the
administration

01:37:47.109 --> 01:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
in teacher um
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
when they do the teacher days and
 
01:37:52.149 --> 01:37:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're teaching you know telling
 
01:37:53.590 --> 01:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
professional development thank you
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's the word um if it's the
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
administration itself that's pushing
 
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.510 align:start position:0%
administration itself that's pushing
um

01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices and asking
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
their teachers to teach these things
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
who do you go to in that case
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion you would go to either
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
the superintendent or the school board
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
at that point but that's be the people
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about if they're the ones if
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is the one who's
 
01:38:19.679 --> 01:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is the one who's
pushing

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
on the school administration these
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
things on the whole district say these
 
01:38:29.590 --> 01:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
discriminatory teachings
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
i i think you answered that okay
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
next is jill's bisnay
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.639 --> 01:39:08.709 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:08.719 --> 01:39:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
can hear me now oh wow makes a world of
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
difference doesn't it thank you
 
01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.470 align:start position:0%
difference doesn't it thank you
um

01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman for the
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today my name is
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
jill bissonette i'm the legal director
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the aclu of new hampshire i know
 
01:39:52.149 --> 01:39:52.159 align:start position:0%
that this committee has already heard
 
01:39:54.550 --> 01:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
our testimony on related bills including
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
hb 13 13 which would extend
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
what we call the banned concepts act uh
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
to higher education so i i won't get
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
into as many details but of course i'm
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take uh questions following my
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
testimony our position and if it's also
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee
 
01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
my testimony is really going to cover
 
01:40:13.199 --> 01:40:14.149 align:start position:0%
my testimony is really going to cover
both

01:40:14.149 --> 01:40:14.159 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
um hp 1090 and 1576 i hope that that is
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the committee
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
to do it all together i just thought it
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
made sense from an efficiency
 
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.270 align:start position:0%
made sense from an efficiency
perspective

01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
um with respect to both of these bills i
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
think our we support both i think our
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
preference uh is for the committee to
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh adopt uh hb 1090 which is a repeal
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
and replace of course if the committee
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
is is not amenable to
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
adopting that bill we then would prefer
 
01:40:43.830 --> 01:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the the full repeal bill which is
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
hb 1576
 
01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
and i do want to echo some of the
 
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
testimony we heard before today we we
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
have very serious concerns with
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
um again what we're calling the the ban
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
concepts act um and we've in fact filed
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit along with the nea and other
 
01:41:03.510 --> 01:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders concerning that statute the
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
focus of that lawsuit
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
is on the statutes
 
01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.950 align:start position:0%
is on the statutes
ambiguities

01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
ambiguities
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
which are very problematic when you
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
particularly when you consider the laws
 
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
penalties so i just want to get into
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
that just a little bit
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
we think that this
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
law is
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
so unclear and vague that it fails to
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
provide necessary guidance to educators
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
about what they can and cannot teach in
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
schools and we think that this ambiguity
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
very well could end up leading to
 
01:41:32.310 --> 01:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
so just by way of history i know we've
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
all been living with this law for the
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
past year and a half you know as it went
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
through the budget cycle last year uh
 
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
but this really all does start from an
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
executive order that was
 
01:41:46.229 --> 01:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
put in place back in september of 2020
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
during the right before the presidential
 
01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.669 align:start position:0%
during the right before the presidential
election

01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
that executive order uh from president
 
01:41:54.550 --> 01:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
trump actually listed out 10
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
banned concepts and there of course the
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
context was in
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
with respect to federal employment
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal employers as well as
 
01:42:06.310 --> 01:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
federal contractors
 
01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.510 align:start position:0%
federal contractors
and

01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
some of those banned concepts in fact
 
01:42:14.390 --> 01:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
were designed to include topics like um
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
systemic racism unconscious bias in fact
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
one of the interpreting memos
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
on top of that executive order made
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
clear that those were the concepts that
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
were designed to be at issue there was a
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuit over that executive order was
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
filed out in california
 
01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.790 align:start position:0%
filed out in california
and

01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
it was partially enjoined or partially
 
01:42:36.390 --> 01:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
blocked in part on vagueness
 
01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
and ambiguity grounds
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
and so kind of fast forward to the new
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire kind of iteration of of this
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
law when it was placed in the budget
 
01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
law when it was placed in the budget
it

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
has four of those concepts that were in
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
president trump's executive order
 
01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
president trump's executive order
so

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
in in our view those four concepts have
 
01:42:57.830 --> 01:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
the same vagueness same ambiguity
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
problems that president trump's
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
executive order had
 
01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple kind of highlights
 
01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
so there's a couple kind of highlights
behind

01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
behind
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
this statute on top of its ambiguities
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to the four concepts
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
on top of that are really serious
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
penalties right so um just to outline
 
01:43:17.270 --> 01:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know the the act imposes penalties
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
for violating its provisions one remedy
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
for a perceived violation is a civil
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
action in superior court against the
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
government entity probably a school
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
district maybe even the teacher for
 
01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
damages and equitable relief including
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
an injunction to stop training or
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
instructing on that bank concept i think
 
01:43:35.270 --> 01:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the penalty that's garnered the
 
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
most attention i think reasonably so
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
is how a violation of this statute is
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
construed to be a violation of the
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
educator's code of conduct which is put
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
in place several a few years ago i think
 
01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
around 2018
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
2019 and one of the penalties for under
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
the educator's code of conduct is is the
 
01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
equivalent of really the death penalty
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
for teacher right the complete loss
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
of licensure um so i think at its core
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
the concern that we have is you have
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
ambiguities with respect to what's
 
01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:06.390 align:start position:0%
ambiguities with respect to what's
prohibited

01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
plus very serious penalties for
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
violations and the result of that kind
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
of recipe is a chill is teachers being
 
01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
so fearful
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
of those penalties that they won't get
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
they don't want to they're so worried
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
about their covering these topics
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to cover these
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
topics and i think we've now with the
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
lived experience of this law having been
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
in place for four or five months now we
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
are starting to see that um and this is
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
kind of pivoting now to my my second
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
point um is
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
that there have been efforts to get
 
01:44:40.629 --> 01:44:40.639 align:start position:0%
concrete guidance from the department of
 
01:44:40.639 --> 01:44:41.750 align:start position:0%
concrete guidance from the department of
education

01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
not just you know uh
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
at a high level but at a very concrete
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
level you know there have been requests
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
made for example
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
is tiffany jewell's book this book is
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
anti-racist banned under the act is the
 
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
book stamped for kids banned under the
 
01:44:59.189 --> 01:44:59.199 align:start position:0%
act and this the state just won't answer
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
those basic questions and that is
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
concerning to me
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
the department of education is one of
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
the enforcers of this statute so i think
 
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
they have an obligation to explain with
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
clarity not just at a high level but a
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
discrete granular level
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
what is covered and what isn't because
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
if a teacher guesses wrong
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
they can be hauled into court but
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps even more seriously they could
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
lose their teacher's license so
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that is something that i'm very
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
concerned about it's just a complete
 
01:45:29.669 --> 01:45:29.679 align:start position:0%
inability in the context of discrete
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
concrete examples to get guidance
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
because if this law was so simple and
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
easy to understand it was so clear
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
the department of education would have
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
easy answers to these questions right
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes this is covered or no this isn't
 
01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:45.189 align:start position:0%
yes this is covered or no this isn't
covered

01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
these discussions on race and gender
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
that are being chilled
 
01:45:51.270 --> 01:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
under this law are really i think
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical
 
01:45:56.629 --> 01:45:56.639 align:start position:0%
um the failure or the inability to cover
 
01:45:56.639 --> 01:45:57.750 align:start position:0%
um the failure or the inability to cover
these

01:45:57.750 --> 01:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.390 align:start position:0%
these
topics

01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.030 --> 01:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
is harmful because the actual discussion
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
of these topics it provides benefits for
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
students i think and and as well as for
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
society at large student body body
 
01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:10.870 align:start position:0%
society at large student body body
diversity

01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
and the results in diversity and views
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
and perspectives and improves critical
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
thinking and problem solving it
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
increases cross-racial understanding
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
reduces stereotypes and prejudices and
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
develops leadership and critical
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
thinking skills so there are harms when
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
these discussions and these instructions
 
01:46:27.590 --> 01:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
are chilled
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i think relatedly we are seeing a
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
rapid diversification of the state of
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we've seen this with
 
01:46:36.790 --> 01:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
respect to the 2020 census and where is
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's growing diversity it is
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
actually in young people and so i think
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
for those reasons it is all the more
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
important that we have these discussions
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the classroom because instruction on
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
race and gender including on concepts
 
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
that address diversity diversity equity
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
inclusion they not only serve to close
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
existing opportunity gaps but they help
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
create a greater sense of belonging
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
among those communities so with that
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'll close my testimony and again just
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
to reiterate i think our hope is that
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
the committee would adopt and pass 1090
 
01:47:07.830 --> 01:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
and if the committee is not inclined to
 
01:47:10.229 --> 01:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
do so that it would adopt the repeal
 
01:47:11.350 --> 01:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
bill which is
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
hp 1576. thank you
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh questions from the committee
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffat
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chair and thanks for
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you so i'm
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
most of us have been in the classroom
 
01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:26.310 align:start position:0%
most of us have been in the classroom
and

01:47:26.310 --> 01:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:27.189 align:start position:0%
and
have

01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
are imagining us being in the classroom
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
now with uh this
 
01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
this uh this new statue
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
so it occurs to me that if there is a
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
complaint or a concern
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
um unless there is a
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
video or an audio of the class it really
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
devolve or descends to like a he said
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
she said scenario so i'm just my
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
question is uh in terms of a complaint i
 
01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if there have been any
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
complaints yet uh there may i don't know
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
but if or when there is ever a complaint
 
01:48:03.750 --> 01:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
about some sort of uh teacher behavior
 
01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.709 align:start position:0%
about some sort of uh teacher behavior
um

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
does does the aclu have a position on
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
classroom recordings i know
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
during covert there's been a lot of
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
hybrid and remote learning but do you
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a position on
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
classroom recordings
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that it might protect a teacher
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if we have taken a position
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
on that i think you know there
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh probably is a debate or growing
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
debate as to what extent there are
 
01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
expectations of privacy in the classroom
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
because it's not a typical kind of
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
public place necessarily i don't know i
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
don't i don't think our organization has
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily taken a position on that
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's a good question
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah can i just follow up on that that
 
01:48:44.070 --> 01:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually is why because you're right
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to course room and
 
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
instruction there's kind of a natural
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
filter you know students will come home
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
and bring home you know either a comment
 
01:48:52.390 --> 01:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
that another student made or what a
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
teacher said and you know there's just
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
natural filtering that happens you know
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily get the picture
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
you're right without something more
 
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:00.320 align:start position:0%
definitive that to me is actually why
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's all the more critical in the
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
context of books right we know that a a
 
01:49:06.629 --> 01:49:06.639 align:start position:0%
teacher is or students are reading a
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
book cover to cover we know exactly what
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
that book says right because it's
 
01:49:11.189 --> 01:49:11.199 align:start position:0%
published that to me is why it's all the
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
more important in the context of books
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
right to have a greater understanding as
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is covered and is this not covered
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
and that just guidance at least in my
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
view hasn't been provided
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh reference tanner
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
i want to go back to a question that i
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
asked before um and the person really
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
didn't um
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know know for sure but in um 1090
 
01:49:41.589 --> 01:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
there's a line that says um
 
01:49:41.599 --> 01:49:42.390 align:start position:0%
there's a line that says um
that

01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
that uh barring any person employed by a
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
public school district school
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
administrative unit or public academy
 
01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
administrative unit or public academy
from

01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
from or
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
subjecting them to civil liability for
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in any form of cons of
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
instruction blah blah you know
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
historical concept does that civil
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
liability subjecting them to civil
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
liability the prohibition to that does
 
01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:05.589 align:start position:0%
liability the prohibition to that does
that

01:50:05.589 --> 01:50:05.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh also apply to the department of
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
education taking away their teaching
 
01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:12.629 align:start position:0%
education taking away their teaching
credential

01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily it is that that's a
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
separate procedure that i think exists
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
out outside
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
the court system
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
this is at least in 1090s context this
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a repeal and replace so the
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
certification issue that i talked about
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
would be repealed
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
the language i think in 1090 is designed
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
frankly to honestly create
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility just to make
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear that when these
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
discussions are are occurring to give
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
breathing space for those discussions
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
that there isn't also then the
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
possibility of being hauled into court
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
which is a a component of the banned
 
01:50:51.589 --> 01:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
comp system act right it's not just the
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
teacher certification
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
ramification there's also separate
 
01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
provisions in the statute that make
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
clear as i noted in the outset of my
 
01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
you could be hauled into court there
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
could be requests for damages and
 
01:51:05.750 --> 01:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
junctive relief etc so i think that
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
language in 1090 is designed probably to
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
get more at that that piece does that
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
make sense thank you
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:16.229 align:start position:0%
follow up
um

01:51:16.229 --> 01:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
my other question is also on terminology
 
01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
often in these laws we see uh the
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
terminology free freedom from
 
01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.350 align:start position:0%
terminology free freedom from
discrimination

01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
um and i was and then
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
we have other ones that are
 
01:51:31.669 --> 01:51:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh you know relative to certain
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
discrimination i was wondering if you
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
could in your mind
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
discern what's the difference between
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
being free from discrimination
 
01:51:41.510 --> 01:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
and discrimination itself
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question i'm not
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
i think i have to give some thought to
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
it i think one of the things that
 
01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
has kind of become clear to me in kind
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
of reviewing the statute learning a
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
little bit more about it talking to
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
teachers in particular and talking to
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
impacted communities
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
is when you look at that term kind of
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination in a vacuum and
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
particularly how it's defined in this
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
statute through these these four kind of
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
concepts that i that i would assume are
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
attempting to define
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
in permissible discrimination
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
it is so difficult to define that it is
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
almost impossible not to
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
at least arguably ban
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
instructions concerning lived
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
experiences that have a connection to
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
historical events
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
instructions around that asking
 
01:52:30.310 --> 01:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
questions like you know how does the
 
01:52:33.990 --> 01:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
legacy of slavery impact folks today
 
01:52:36.070 --> 01:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
that is really though it's really
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer and because of those
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
ambiguities i just think that's why
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
you're seeing the chill that's of course
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
why i think as well
 
01:52:45.510 --> 01:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
a california district judge
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
you know preliminarily enjoined
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:54.790 --> 01:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you oh
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry representative mullen thank
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i'm i'm always behind
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
something over here uh thank you for
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:53:06.550 --> 01:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
so um one of the current concerns that i
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
have had with the uh prohibition on
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
teaching discrimination is that a lot of
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
it depends upon personal perception
 
01:53:15.679 --> 01:53:16.629 align:start position:0%
it depends upon personal perception
and

01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:16.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to ask you uh the same
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
question mr bisnet that i put somewhat
 
01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
forward towards
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh megan tuttle
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that is let's say i'm a member of
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
the black community the
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
disability community the gay community
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
feel that things are not being taught
 
01:53:43.599 --> 01:53:44.629 align:start position:0%
feel that things are not being taught
about

01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
my experience
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
is there the potential for families to
 
01:53:54.310 --> 01:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
claim that that in and of itself is
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination that if
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
history is being denied
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
is that in fact a form of discrimination
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
against the protected classes
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i think one of the things
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
that we're we're seeing the books that
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
are being pulled or you know are being
 
01:54:13.510 --> 01:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of shelved
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
who's writing those books they're people
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
of color right right talking about their
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
experiences and trying to write about
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
those experiences in a way that relates
 
01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
to students
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
taking those books away i think is
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
deeply harmful belittling to those uh
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
lived experiences and so i mean it is
 
01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
something that we are concerned about is
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
that chill and how it has an impact on
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
those affected communities
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
is it unreasonable for me to think that
 
01:54:49.589 --> 01:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
if uh we've got
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
school district a
 
01:54:51.679 --> 01:54:54.310 align:start position:0%
school district a
and

01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
books are being removed and they
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
as you said the authors happen to be
 
01:55:01.750 --> 01:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
from a divergent
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
would it
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
is is it feasible to think that legal
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
action could be taken and a case could
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
be made for
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
the fact that the authors of the books
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
that are being uh questioned are among
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
minority groups
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i have to give some
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
thought thought to it um
 
01:55:29.189 --> 01:55:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's a good question i i as as a lawyer
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
i try not to opine in areas that i
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
haven't fully researched
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
um but i uh
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
i see the validity of that concern
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
 
01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.910 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative
porter

01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
porter
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you it's good
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
to see you again good to see you yes um
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
you're blocked by a speaker yeah i am
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm always blocked they do that on
 
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
i'm always blocked they do that on
purpose

01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.629 --> 01:55:54.639 align:start position:0%
is the unconscious bias
 
01:55:57.910 --> 01:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
part of what a concept that is banned in
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i have two parts to this
 
01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.550 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i have two parts to this
question

01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:56:02.149 --> 01:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
yeah is that one of the
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
concepts that we think is being it's
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
potentially banned no doubt can i i
 
01:56:08.229 --> 01:56:08.239 align:start position:0%
can't wait to flush that out a little
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
bit why or yeah okay so
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
what i have in front of me is is a study
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
an article from bloomberg equality that
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
was published in july 29 2021
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
and the title is job applicants with
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
black names in quotes still less likely
 
01:56:27.589 --> 01:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
to get interviews
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is a study that's been going on for
 
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
years where they submit
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
identical uh
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
resumes with different names to
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
most likely the people
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
with the black names don't get called as
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
often back as the
 
01:56:45.189 --> 01:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
people who don't have the black names
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
if a teacher was to teach or present
 
01:56:50.390 --> 01:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
this to their class in
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
social sciences
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
in a new hampshire high school
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
could they be called
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
out as part of this um
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair and thank
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
you uh uh very very much deals for for
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
um joining us uh again this morning um
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
looking at where's oh thank you
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
i couldn't see where you were i'm sorry
 
01:57:21.750 --> 01:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
with the masks and that's all right now
 
01:57:24.870 --> 01:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
no so um
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
so referring back to the the current law
 
01:57:31.109 --> 01:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
in 195.40
 
01:57:31.119 --> 01:57:31.910 align:start position:0%
in 195.40
um

01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
and uh the language
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
that talks about no pupil in any public
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
school and then it goes on to towards
 
01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
the end of the statute into the
 
01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
the end of the statute into the
violations

01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
violations
 
01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:42.709 align:start position:0%
violations
and

01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
what takes place there but does the
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
current language in your
 
01:57:49.109 --> 01:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
estimation discriminate against licensed
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
teachers in school districts when
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
compared with other licensed teachers
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
who practice
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
in other
 
01:58:00.629 --> 01:58:00.639 align:start position:0%
public school settings or in non-public
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
schools that are under contract
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
with a school district or maybe student
 
01:58:08.310 --> 01:58:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe teachers licensed
 
01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.270 align:start position:0%
maybe teachers licensed
teachers

01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:58:11.669 --> 01:58:11.679 align:start position:0%
who practice as part of the um the
 
01:58:15.189 --> 01:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
education freedom account program
 
01:58:18.310 --> 01:58:18.320 align:start position:0%
so this this only covers
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the portions that you're dealing
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
with that you're referencing i believe
 
01:58:23.189 --> 01:58:23.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with the educators code of
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
conduct and the license ramifications
 
01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
there only deal with teachers who are
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
certified um uh
 
01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.149 align:start position:0%
certified um uh
uh

01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
by by the state so i'm actually less
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
concerned with kind of private schools
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that you can teach at a
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
private school without certainly i don't
 
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know the answer to that
 
01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:41.270 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know the answer to that
yeah

01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't ask about private schools
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay sorry but the um but the bill
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
the bill the current law the bill
 
01:58:51.709 --> 01:58:51.719 align:start position:0%
obviously repeals
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
193.40 so i think this is this is a
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
relevant uh question to the bill because
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
because it's specific to current law
 
01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:02.470 align:start position:0%
because it's specific to current law
but

01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
current law
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:59:08.709 --> 01:59:08.719 align:start position:0%
193 440
 
01:59:10.470 --> 01:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
roman 4
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
says violation of the section by an
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
educator shall be considered a violation
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
of the educator code of contact the
 
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
code of conduct that justifies
 
01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
disciplinary sanction by the state board
 
01:59:24.149 --> 01:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
of education then roman five goes on to
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
say for the purpose of this section
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
educator means a professional employee
 
01:59:31.990 --> 01:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
of any school district whose position
 
01:59:34.229 --> 01:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
requires certification by the state
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
board so so my question goes
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
it really pertains to discrimination
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
against educators who are employed
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
by any school district as opposed to
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
educators again professionals who are
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
certified by the state board of
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
education licensed by the state board of
 
01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
education licensed by the state board of
education

01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
as a teacher who who may teach in a in
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
another public school setting and
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
examples of this
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
would be would be
 
02:00:09.109 --> 02:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
who teach in a chartered public school
 
02:00:11.910 --> 02:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
or who teach in a non-public school that
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
is under contract with a school district
 
02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:16.070 align:start position:0%
is under contract with a school district
or

02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
teach as part of the education freedom
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
account program
 
02:00:23.189 --> 02:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
as we know that that there are sections
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
in the in the education freedom account
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
program specifically under
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
may

02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
may
 
02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
may need to become involved in terms of
 
02:00:40.470 --> 02:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
reviewing a student's an efa student's
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio so so this section to me seems
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
to only call out educators
 
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
who are licensed
 
02:00:50.229 --> 02:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
educators who are employed by a public
 
02:00:54.310 --> 02:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
school district and not those who are
 
02:00:54.320 --> 02:00:55.510 align:start position:0%
school district and not those who are
employed

02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
employed
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
in other public school settings and and
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
my question is is that discriminatory
 
02:01:04.229 --> 02:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
against against teachers who
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
are employed by public school by school
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
districts it's certainly a distinction
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
the law is making i see the point i see
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
the point you're raising okay thank you
 
02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:13.990 align:start position:0%
the point you're raising okay thank you
representative

02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman quickly please
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman ellie
 
02:01:20.870 --> 02:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thank you so much for taking my
 
02:01:24.709 --> 02:01:24.719 align:start position:0%
question i appreciate you being here um
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
i had three questions but i'm not going
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
to ask them because i know
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
billy's trying to save time but i won't
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
follow up on one sure i was thinking of
 
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
the comments that representatives to my
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
right here made about
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh discrimination i mean look kept on
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
looking back at your thing on censorship
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
your statement of 5-3
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
is the um if this
 
02:01:45.830 --> 02:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
law is now construed requires educators
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
to omit
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
information that typically they may
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
would have presented in a classroom
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
is the omission of information being
 
02:01:57.510 --> 02:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
presented discrimination in itself by
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.070 --> 02:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
again that's a good question
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the legal sense you
 
02:02:06.229 --> 02:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
know i i think i just want to give more
 
02:02:07.750 --> 02:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
thought to it i mean i can tell you that
 
02:02:09.669 --> 02:02:09.679 align:start position:0%
as a policy matter
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
the nub of our concern right with this
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
statute is that ambiguities plus
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
strict penalties create that very
 
02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
environment where certain instruction is
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
not occurring instruction that we that
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
is beneficial uh and we think critical
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
frankly as new hampshire becomes more
 
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
nervous i'm not trying to evade your
 
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
question i just from a from a legal
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
perspective i i don't know if i've quite
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
thought that through
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for your time
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh next
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
thank you committee chair thank you
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
company members i want to talk to you a
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about a story from a long
 
02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
02:03:05.430 --> 02:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
um my um
 
02:03:08.310 --> 02:03:08.320 align:start position:0%
child went to school one day came back
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
and i said how was school she said
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
didn't like it
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
i said oh my goodness first grader well
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
it was pre preschool it was head start
 
02:03:21.030 --> 02:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
so this is how long i go back um i said
 
02:03:22.870 --> 02:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
she said didn't like it i said why not
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to talk about it
 
02:03:27.669 --> 02:03:27.679 align:start position:0%
and she was very passionate about
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not going there um
 
02:03:32.470 --> 02:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
so throughout the entire night i
 
02:03:35.030 --> 02:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
continued to try to talk to her about
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
what happened in school
 
02:03:40.229 --> 02:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
finally she disclosed scary man came
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
scary man came talked about scary stuff
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
showed me
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
took me to a scary place showed me scary
 
02:03:46.320 --> 02:03:47.750 align:start position:0%
took me to a scary place showed me scary
things

02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
this was at the same time
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
that there was um a public
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh preschool in massachusetts that was
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
being brought up on sexual allocations
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
so as a parent you can understand my
 
02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:02.870 align:start position:0%
so as a parent you can understand my
concern

02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
i immediately went to the school and
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
tried to figure out who scary man was
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
and what the heck what they were doing
 
02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
in my child's school
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
it took about a week and a half
 
02:04:16.870 --> 02:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
to determine that scary man was officer
 
02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:17.910 align:start position:0%
to determine that scary man was officer
friendly

02:04:17.910 --> 02:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
friendly
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
officer friendly was a scary man because
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
i had not done a good job with my child
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
to identify that police officers with
 
02:04:31.350 --> 02:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
had i just jumped
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
and filed a complaint
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
that daycare and those teachers would
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
have gone through a huge fiasco huge
 
02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.350 align:start position:0%
have gone through a huge fiasco huge
investigation

02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
02:04:48.069 --> 02:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is is that
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
we as a society have taken sides we we
 
02:04:55.109 --> 02:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
talk about diversity well diversity is
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
actually a negative concept if you look
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
at diverse
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
diverse is division
 
02:05:04.069 --> 02:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
diverse the the definition of diverse is
 
02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
different from one another on the
 
02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:07.030 align:start position:0%
different from one another on the
unalike

02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
unalike
 
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
composed of distinct or unlike elements
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
or qualities
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
when did we start when did we start
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
identifying people by the negative
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
our educators have a fantastic
 
02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:20.629 align:start position:0%
our educators have a fantastic
opportunity

02:05:20.629 --> 02:05:20.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
to make our uniqueness
 
02:05:23.440 --> 02:05:24.790 align:start position:0%
to make our uniqueness
wonderful

02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
when did our uniqueness become a
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
negative thing
 
02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
when when when my children were young
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
and they came home and one of the kids
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the class wore the little thing on
 
02:05:36.629 --> 02:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
their head they asked what was that all
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
about because they'd never seen it
 
02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:40.719 align:start position:0%
before i as a parent was able to educate
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
them when did we take
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
the ability from our educators to
 
02:05:48.709 --> 02:05:48.719 align:start position:0%
provide children with both sides
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
without putting in their own opinions
 
02:05:54.550 --> 02:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
and let children
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with the parents
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
and the teachers because i can honestly
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
i honestly believe most of our educators
 
02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
would welcome
 
02:06:07.270 --> 02:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i've heard it time and time again
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
parents parents use us as babysitters
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
well if you don't want to be used as
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
babysitters engage with the parents
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
start becoming involved start start
 
02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
having conversations i know they're hard
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
our society has become a society of
 
02:06:26.069 --> 02:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
keyboard warriors we don't we don't talk
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
about the difficult conversations
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
anymore and that's why
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
this bill for me is a problem
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
the only reason why this bill for me is
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
a problem is because it further divides
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the teachers and the pa our educators
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
and our parents
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
it furthers pins one against the other
 
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
and that's not okay the bottom line is
 
02:06:51.910 --> 02:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination is discrimination but
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
it's also i believe in the eye of the
 
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
beholder so just because officer
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
friendly was scary to my daughter
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean it's scary to everybody
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
just because being a black or brown
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
child in our world today
 
02:07:08.310 --> 02:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
should not
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't focus on their differences
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
when did we start focuses on differences
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
let's start focus on what we are similar
 
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
let's start focus on what we are similar
humanity

02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
humanity
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
our educators should not be forced to
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
teach children about our differences
 
02:07:27.830 --> 02:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
they should be taught they should be be
 
02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.030 align:start position:0%
they should be taught they should be be
allowed

02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
to educate on our similarities they
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
should be allowed to provide education
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
on all sides
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and then help the children like
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
had explained help them she presented
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
both sides she presented the whole piece
 
02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
and then help children to learn critical
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
thinking skills and if i look up what is
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
a critical thinking skill that's also
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
ethics and morals
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think our educators want to
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
force our children into developing
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
ethics and morals they want to
 
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the parents because
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
that student is theirs for six hours a
 
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
that student is theirs for six hours a
day

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
day
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
but they're also the parents children
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
02:08:17.109 --> 02:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is we need a
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
collaborative cooperative
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
um atmosphere and laws like this and
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
even the law unfortunately the law that
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
was put in place last year
 
02:08:31.350 --> 02:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
the only reason why i have a problem
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
with that law is because i felt like it
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
had to be in place to protect
 
02:08:39.910 --> 02:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
our good educators and to try and focus
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the educators that are not educating
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
but potentially in doctoring
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm more than welcome to
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%

02:08:52.310 --> 02:08:52.320 align:start position:0%

you're okay thank you very much

by all
 
02:09:07.119 --> 02:09:08.629 align:start position:0%

good
good morning

02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
take this off
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
just so that you can clearly hear me
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh good morning committee my name is
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
asma huni and i am here to testify on
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
two bills
 
02:09:36.550 --> 02:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
hb 1090 and also if you allow me hb 1576
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
because they're just so similar
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
so again my name is asan alhini and i do
 
02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
not have my lobby badge but i am a
 
02:09:45.430 --> 02:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
lobbyist with rights on democracy but i
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
am also here in my capacity as a proud
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
immigrant a person of color and a muslim
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
all these identities give me a unique
 
02:09:58.390 --> 02:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
experience in this country
 
02:10:00.709 --> 02:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
after 9 11 my whole community was
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
painted with the same brush
 
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of suspicion distrust and to be
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
watched even though the majority of
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
muslims had no connection to the
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
terrorists who committed violence
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
who committed the violence we were all
 
02:10:15.990 --> 02:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
painted with the same brush
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
unlike other terrorists like the
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
oklahoma city bombing where a white man
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
committed violence not all white people
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
our community had to register on lists
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
we were still we are and were
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
surveillanced we were put on something
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
called no-fly lists we have laws created
 
02:10:42.310 --> 02:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
in ordinances to justify to make sure
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't put mosques or places of
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
worship in town
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're pulled aside in airports we can be
 
02:10:51.669 --> 02:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
arrested and never told why
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
because if you use the excuse terrorists
 
02:10:55.990 --> 02:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
then you don't have to tell muslims why
 
02:10:57.669 --> 02:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're being arrested and so there's no
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
due process
 
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is called institutional racism
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
when i get pulled aside at the airport
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
90 percent of the time when i fly it is
 
02:11:11.350 --> 02:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
called institutional racism
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
you see to me it's not a question of
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
whether institutional racism exists
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
it exists in our country it exists in
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
our state i live it my community lives
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
it the question is are we brave enough
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
to be willing to address this and to
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
talk about it to make sure it changes
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
i want to be honest with you and share
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
that public schools have not been a safe
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
place for me and for people that look
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
like me
 
02:11:40.159 --> 02:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
like me
i

02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:11:43.350 --> 02:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
when i was a child i had not only
 
02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
students mock me but also teachers
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
no young person deserves this every
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
child deserves to learn the truth about
 
02:11:53.430 --> 02:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
our nation our state our communities but
 
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
the truth is new hampshire is not immune
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
if you look at the new hampshire fiscal
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
policy institute you will learn the many
 
02:12:07.510 --> 02:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
different ways racism still exists today
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
if you truly believe that racism does
 
02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
not exist anymore you are the reason why
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
we must have these honest discussions
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
that can only be had when bills like
 
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
this are in this bill is in place not
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
last session's bill because last
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
session's bill makes these conversations
 
02:12:26.629 --> 02:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
impossible and you're hearing from
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
teachers that want to teach truth that
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
they are not doing so
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm asking today to do the right
 
02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
thing and repeal last year's bill by
 
02:12:39.669 --> 02:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
and just the other thing we've heard
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
already there are two lawsuits in new
 
02:12:46.870 --> 02:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire around this bill we know that
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
we are making our great teachers want to
 
02:12:51.589 --> 02:12:51.599 align:start position:0%
leave this state and we're keeping
 
02:12:53.350 --> 02:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
awesome teachers who want to come in
 
02:12:55.189 --> 02:12:55.199 align:start position:0%

thank you very much are there any
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:13:04.950 --> 02:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing hands thank you very much
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay and just like just wanted to point
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
out just um because there was something
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
said about like well what if communities
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
like mine want to actually um
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
to say something like you know there's
 
02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
books that are um being discriminating
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
against my community which has happened
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
um in florida the council on american
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
islamic relations took that on um there
 
02:13:27.510 --> 02:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
is processes currently in place for my
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
community to go through so i think it
 
02:13:31.669 --> 02:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
really belongs to local instead of the
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
state addressing that and so um yeah so
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
just the school board the superintendent
 
02:13:37.830 --> 02:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's other avenues if we
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
don't get um you know if that doesn't
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
get solved that way so please do repeal
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
this it's we can't we can't be living in
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
a state like this it's just harming us
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
right so thank you very much we do we
 
02:13:51.830 --> 02:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
did we just received another card here
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%

history
 
02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
i learned the background a lot of people
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
we have so much so much diversity we
 
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
have so many different cultures we have
 
02:14:50.790 --> 02:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
so many different languages
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
that i really really think
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep that it's an
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
immigrant it is critical for me to learn
 
02:15:00.790 --> 02:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
the history
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%

in order to respect
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
everyone's differences i i believe that
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
is is
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's a good way for teachers like my
 
02:15:15.669 --> 02:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
kids that were born here but they've
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
really appreciated like my daughter and
 
02:15:19.669 --> 02:15:19.679 align:start position:0%

our corporate office
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
she appreciate the background that she
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
she has the latino background but she
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%

02:15:29.589 --> 02:15:29.599 align:start position:0%
from other cultures because that helping
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%

02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
how other cultures are different and how
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
can she manage and not
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable when um different
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
religions and different cultures being

bill on the this issue so i'm going to
 
02:18:45.190 --> 02:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
try to just
 
02:18:47.910 --> 02:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
stick to the points here um but i come
 
02:18:51.669 --> 02:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
to offer hb 1576
 
02:18:53.110 --> 02:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
to what is known as a repeal to the
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts language
 
02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
and to give context in 2021 a ban on
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts was voted in and ended
 
02:19:01.589 --> 02:19:01.599 align:start position:0%
up being tabled
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
but like so much legislation in the past
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
it came through came back in hb2 of the
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
budget and as we know the budget and the
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
trailer passed last year and was signed
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
um i spoke to colleagues who believe
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
that while they supported a majority of
 
02:19:17.830 --> 02:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
the budget this and other pieces of hb2
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
were things they were not happy with but
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
believe this budget needed to pass so
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
i and other colleagues are here are uh
 
02:19:28.150 --> 02:19:28.160 align:start position:0%
to repeal this provision of the budget
 
02:19:29.910 --> 02:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i'll start with what this bill
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
denies our students from learning it
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
denies our students from learning the
 
02:19:35.110 --> 02:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
actual history of our country
 
02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
and for example they won't learn that
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
staves or slaves were actually
 
02:19:40.950 --> 02:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
owned here in new hampshire past the
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war and learned that
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
heroes like frederick douglass denounced
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
the practice of building statues of
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
confederate soldiers known as the lost
 
02:19:49.359 --> 02:19:50.469 align:start position:0%
confederate soldiers known as the lost
cause

02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
is the history of the trail of tears
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable of course it is but i
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
heard that if we cannot if we do not
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
learn about our history we are doomed to
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
repeat it
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
this means teaching our younger
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
generation of the struggle that so many
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
faced in the past and that we don't
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
sugarcoat it
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
this is not meant to cast the blame on
 
02:20:12.389 --> 02:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
the sins of our forefathers or on us
 
02:20:12.399 --> 02:20:13.349 align:start position:0%
the sins of our forefathers or on us
today

02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:20:15.349 --> 02:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is meant to see the effects of how
 
02:20:17.190 --> 02:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the past is still
 
02:20:20.070 --> 02:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
present in our current system still
 
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:22.160 align:start position:0%
we still see discrepancies in
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
generational wealth between racial and
 
02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
ethnic groups we still see that parts of
 
02:20:27.910 --> 02:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
our countries
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
and parts of our country you can still
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
you can be hired one day and fired
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
another because of your gender
 
02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:33.910 align:start position:0%
another because of your gender
orientation

02:20:33.910 --> 02:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
we even know that by prohibiting the
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
conversation of history of the
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
disability community we are preventing
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves from learning how recent the
 
02:20:43.830 --> 02:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
ada has been around in our country which
 
02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:44.469 align:start position:0%
ada has been around in our country which
is

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
fairly recent um you can even tell
 
02:20:50.790 --> 02:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
how recent desegregation has happened
 
02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
and that you know segregation is still a
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
structural issue that exists in our
 
02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:55.670 align:start position:0%
structural issue that exists in our
country

02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
we have made strides for progress to so
 
02:21:00.950 --> 02:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
many vulnerable groups the establishment
 
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
of this ban has made it incredibly
 
02:21:05.030 --> 02:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
difficult for our educators to do their
 
02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:05.910 align:start position:0%
difficult for our educators to do their
job

02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
job
 
02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
we have seen a website created to report
 
02:21:10.150 --> 02:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
any educator in our state from doing
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
their job at a time during a global
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic when their jobs are hard enough
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
just to keep our kids healthy and safe
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough our educators spend
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
money out of their pockets so that they
 
02:21:21.670 --> 02:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
can provide a great experience in the
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
classrooms or that their res that the
 
02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
resources that your classroom receives
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
relies entirely on the zip code that you
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
live in
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
we are we're doing it a service to our
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
educators our public employees and our
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
citizens by gagging their speech and
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
trying to erase our history so i urge
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
this committee to vote to pass on hb
 
02:21:44.309 --> 02:21:44.319 align:start position:0%
1576 to repeal this dangerous provision
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
from law and i'll answer any questions
 
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
represented woodcock
 
02:21:56.950 --> 02:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
president good morning thank you for
 
02:22:01.110 --> 02:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
coming just for clarity purpose of those
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh reading through the bill again and
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh can you explain to me the our
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
simplified layman terms
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
the rsa 354
 
02:22:15.750 --> 02:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
how it connects to uh our current rsa
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
19340 in education
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so i mean this thank you this is
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is inserted from um from our
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
previous budget and um this is something
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
that we you know like i said many of our
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
like would be put into our education
 
02:22:34.070 --> 02:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
statute from from the trailer bill um
 
02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
it really makes it much more vague to
 
02:22:38.469 --> 02:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
understand what discrimination you know
 
02:22:40.469 --> 02:22:40.479 align:start position:0%
looks like in our in our for education
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
so it makes it tougher for our educators
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
to go from there so i
 
02:22:45.670 --> 02:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is we want to make sure that we you
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
know we aren't making it difficult for
 
02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
educators to be able to teach this
 
02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman further
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent tanner
 
02:22:58.469 --> 02:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
people keep looking around i was
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
wondering i asked this before and i i
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
still haven't gotten a really good
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
answer on it but
 
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
um can you
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
define for me what you think the right
 
02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
to freedom from discrimination means
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good question
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
um i mean in theory it would be the idea
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:23:23.590 --> 02:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't feel that
 
02:23:28.550 --> 02:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll take it from myself if i
 
02:23:30.309 --> 02:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
felt that the right discrimination
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't feel like i would be pre-judged
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
because of the color of my skin so to
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
speak that i wouldn't you know i would
 
02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable in most spaces because
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
of who i am
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
um but structurally i know that's not
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
real i know that doesn't exist
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
it's you know i love i would love to
 
02:23:49.990 --> 02:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
live in a world that is colorblind that
 
02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
world just doesn't exist um it is it is
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um because
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
people people are gonna read my resume
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
and they're going to see manuel espitia
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
and they're going to say manuel manuel
 
02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
manuel he must be from a foreign country
 
02:24:07.110 --> 02:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
they will have these preconceived
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
judgments already and that's not like
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know it's not to cast blame on folks
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's just
 
02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
like i struggle with it sometimes too i
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
i will have these these biases that have
 
02:24:19.110 --> 02:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
i've grown up with
 
02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:19.990 align:start position:0%
i've grown up with
um

02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately that's just it's it's
 
02:24:24.150 --> 02:24:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's hard to rewire our brains to kind
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
of think otherwise
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
and this is not to say that people are
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
you know inherently born a certain way
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
this is just you know we are we are we
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
are shaped by our environment we are
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
shaped by the places that we live and it
 
02:24:40.150 --> 02:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately makes it so some
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
some people may have a
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
worse off experience than others so
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
i would i would wish that it would be a
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
you know living free of discrimination
 
02:24:51.110 --> 02:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be a way where people would be
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
treated equally
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
but i unfortunately don't think that
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're there just yet thank you
 
02:25:02.790 --> 02:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%

02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
i do know that i know
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
i just can't talk this morning um one of
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
the prior wetnesses and i think it was
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
jill's bassinet testified that
 
02:25:20.389 --> 02:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
he would rather see
 
02:25:22.870 --> 02:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
house bill 1190 the bill immediately we
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
heard immediately before this passed
 
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
then your bill passed um which was a
 
02:25:28.790 --> 02:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
repeal and replace and yours is simply a
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
repeal and he said but if that didn't
 
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
pass you'd like your bill it's a second
 
02:25:33.990 --> 02:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
choice but i'm wondering how you feel
 
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.190 align:start position:0%
choice but i'm wondering how you feel
about

02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
house bill 1090 as an alternative to
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
i mean i think house bill 1090 is i
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
think a great approach i think um you
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
know we we here in the house see many
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
bills and there's not you know it's not
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
one way to skin a cat so to speak which
 
02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:52.630 align:start position:0%
one way to skin a cat so to speak which
is

02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
um there's more than you know there are
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
multiple ways to handle you know an
 
02:25:57.120 --> 02:25:57.990 align:start position:0%
multiple ways to handle you know an
issue

02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:26:01.590 --> 02:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
um and i think if if hp 1090 passed i
 
02:26:04.150 --> 02:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
think i would i would also be happy um
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
so i would um but i i definitely think
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to address the
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
central problem that uh that was created
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
by by hb2 so um i would be i would be
 
02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
happy with with the passage of hb 1090.
 
02:26:21.030 --> 02:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative mullen

thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my questions
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at the
 
02:26:34.230 --> 02:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
finance note that came with uh your bill
 
02:26:36.389 --> 02:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
particularly looking at
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
rsa 354 a 29
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
which is described as providing
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
restrictions on certain educational
 
02:26:48.880 --> 02:26:50.309 align:start position:0%
restrictions on certain educational
programs

02:26:50.309 --> 02:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
by public employers
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
and allows any person aggrieved by an
 
02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:56.870 align:start position:0%
and allows any person aggrieved by an
act

02:26:56.870 --> 02:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
act
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
to seek a remedy under a whole bunch of
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
different subsections you know what i'm
 
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
referring to in that financial note yes
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
so i i i'm
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
correct am i correct
 
02:27:10.479 --> 02:27:11.270 align:start position:0%
correct am i correct
that

02:27:11.270 --> 02:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
that portion of your bill would
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
primarily uh apply to
 
02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
primarily uh apply to
adults

02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
adults
 
02:27:24.469 --> 02:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
and what we're talking about is adults
 
02:27:27.910 --> 02:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
being offended aggrieved
 
02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
however you want to uh phrase it right
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
over something that an employer feels
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
they want to offer some sort of
 
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:39.920 align:start position:0%
professional development in
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that yes
 
02:27:45.670 --> 02:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
could you uh follow up mr chair could
 
02:27:48.950 --> 02:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
you give me a couple of examples of
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
something that an employer might want to
 
02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
offer professional development on
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
i mean i actually funny enough later
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
today i have a cultural competency
 
02:28:01.030 --> 02:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh i can't i have a cultural competition
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
competency training later on um which i
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
think is great if you want to learn more
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
about how to be culturally competent and
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
learn how to you know address you know
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
certain different groups so some people
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
might get offended by that and say why
 
02:28:17.830 --> 02:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
would i need to do this so um but i
 
02:28:21.110 --> 02:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
think that might be an example of that
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing a lot of myself here so let's
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
we have uh
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
other than self we have two three cards
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
which have organizations like aft or new
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
futures or aclu
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
we will be hearing from so if you have a
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
tactical just
 
02:29:13.910 --> 02:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
hanging off no disrespect
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.200 --> 02:29:18.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:18.389 --> 02:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
02:29:25.510 --> 02:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:25.520 --> 02:29:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.309 --> 02:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:48.389 --> 02:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
sorry good morning my name is jama
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
wilder and i am from hollis new
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire i'm here representing myself
 
02:29:55.590 --> 02:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
i have spoken before the board before
 
02:29:58.070 --> 02:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
but as you know i have five children
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
and two of them are in the public school
 
02:30:02.630 --> 02:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
education i started researching what crt
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
was and to better understand it and what
 
02:30:08.710 --> 02:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts were
 
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
crt is basically creating a utopian
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
society that is never attainable
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
they are putting an oppressor versus an
 
02:30:16.479 --> 02:30:17.590 align:start position:0%
they are putting an oppressor versus an
oppressed

02:30:17.590 --> 02:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
oppressed
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
and they are placing guilt on a
 
02:30:21.190 --> 02:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
generation that had nothing to do with
 
02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
generation that had nothing to do with
it

02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
i have taught my children to judge
 
02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
someone on their character and not on
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
their race color creed or religion
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
since they have come home in the last
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
year they have told me that they have
 
02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:34.150 align:start position:0%
year they have told me that they have
never

02:30:34.150 --> 02:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
never
 
02:30:36.469 --> 02:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
noticed color more than they have since
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
they started going through these classes
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
they are teaching them to see color of a
 
02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
person's skin instead instead of showing
 
02:30:46.150 --> 02:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
them the kindness and love that they
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
should be teaching i'm going to read an
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
example of one of the assignments that
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
was given in our school
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
they had two sources that they could go
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
to and they followed up with questions
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
it says after reading information on
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
both links list some examples of
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
systemic racism in the u.s
 
02:31:06.950 --> 02:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
according to the article from the
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
booking institute explain how we have
 
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
racism in the us today without racist
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
how do you think the media and pop
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
culture contribute to creating negative
 
02:31:19.830 --> 02:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
images of people of color
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
men black men in particular
 
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
it goes on to
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
list a quote which
 
02:31:29.030 --> 02:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i found this
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
disturbing considering it happened in
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
1968 and they're trying to make
 
02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
comparisons of what happened then to our
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
society today
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts on the following
 
02:31:41.990 --> 02:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
quote from john edward
 
02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:44.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry a richmond
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
one of the former president richard
 
02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
nixon's aides
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
the nixon campaign in 1968 in the nixon
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
white house after that had two enemies
 
02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
the anti-war left and black people you
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
understand what i'm saying we knew we
 
02:32:02.070 --> 02:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it illegal to be either
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
against the war on black but by getting
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
the public to associate hippies with
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana and blacks with heroin then
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
criminalizing both heavily we could
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
disrupt those communities we could
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
arrest their leaders raid their homes
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
break up their meetings and vilify them
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
night after night on the evening news
 
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
we did know we were lying about the
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
drugs of course we did this is in 1968
 
02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're using a quote to try to make
 
02:32:29.990 --> 02:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
children have feelings about what's
 
02:32:32.309 --> 02:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
going on in our society today
 
02:32:33.990 --> 02:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's followed up by saying many
 
02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
politicians including the clintons newt
 
02:32:38.950 --> 02:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
gingrich and charles rangel in this film
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
have apologized for their role in
 
02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
promoting devastating tough on crime
 
02:32:43.040 --> 02:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
promoting devastating tough on crime
legislation

02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:32:46.230 --> 02:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
considering the billions of dollars made
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
off the imprisonment of people and the
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing practice of prison labor and the
 
02:32:53.910 --> 02:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
cases of unjust imprisonment as we see
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the tragic case of caliph broder is
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
an apology enough
 
02:33:00.230 --> 02:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
should our country be compelled to repay
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
these communities and families in a more
 
02:33:08.309 --> 02:33:08.319 align:start position:0%
material restorative way why or why not
 
02:33:10.950 --> 02:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
they also have questions like this
 
02:33:13.270 --> 02:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
settling into agriculture societies was
 
02:33:15.270 --> 02:33:15.280 align:start position:0%
the biggest mistake made in human
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
history agree or disagree
 
02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
civilization always leads to an
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
inequality between its people
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
all of the inequality of the world can
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
be traced back to geological luck
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
i wanted you to see how these questions
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
were formed so you understood that it's
 
02:33:32.830 --> 02:33:32.840 align:start position:0%
not an
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
02:33:37.670 --> 02:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
being able to teach about the past
 
02:33:40.150 --> 02:33:40.160 align:start position:0%
the problem is when teachers are
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
presenting material in a way
 
02:33:44.870 --> 02:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
that is not accurate to what's going on
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
02:33:50.389 --> 02:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony about racism and
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
people being considered terrorists based
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
on race which is completely wrong
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
i have been seen by some as a domestic
 
02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
terrorist because i'm a mother fighting
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
for my children's well-being racism will
 
02:34:05.349 --> 02:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
never go away it is all throughout the
 
02:34:07.910 --> 02:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
world our educators should not be
 
02:34:09.750 --> 02:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
dividing our children and making them
 
02:34:11.429 --> 02:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
feel guilty for the sins of their
 
02:34:11.439 --> 02:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
feel guilty for the sins of their
forefathers

02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
forefathers
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
in teaching history
 
02:34:17.750 --> 02:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
and teaching it from different
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives but i do not believe that
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
is the job of an educator to tell my
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
children how to believe
 
02:34:28.830 --> 02:34:28.840 align:start position:0%
and to divide our nation there is enough
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
divisiveness and division going on in
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
our society
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
by asking teachers not to teach about
 
02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
by asking teachers not to teach about
racism

02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
racism
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
it stops them from giving them
 
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much are there
 
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um thank you for
 
02:34:55.510 --> 02:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
taking my questions and
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you being back here again
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
today uh the questions uh that were
 
02:35:02.790 --> 02:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
presented by the faculty member to your
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
youngsters for the agree disagree like a
 
02:35:07.270 --> 02:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
dislike that you read
 
02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh from history and from the
 
02:35:10.309 --> 02:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
administration nixon those types of
 
02:35:10.319 --> 02:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
administration nixon those types of
things

02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what grade level that
 
02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:13.750 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what grade level that
was

02:35:13.750 --> 02:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
that was um sophomore and junior classes
 
02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
but one of the biggest concerns that i
 
02:35:21.030 --> 02:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
have about what they're doing is that
 
02:35:23.030 --> 02:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
they're allowing them only to go to one
 
02:35:26.150 --> 02:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
or two sources at one point in the year
 
02:35:28.630 --> 02:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
my daughter um wanted to go to another
 
02:35:31.110 --> 02:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
source and she used a direct quote from
 
02:35:33.270 --> 02:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
from someone's writings and then
 
02:35:35.750 --> 02:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
gave her analogy or her thoughts on it
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
and the teacher came back and said that
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
she thought that it was argumentative
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
and that she needed to redo the
 
02:35:41.200 --> 02:35:42.630 align:start position:0%
and that she needed to redo the
assignment

02:35:42.630 --> 02:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
02:35:43.670 --> 02:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're not allowing them any critical
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
thinking they're saying you can go to
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
one source
 
02:35:51.510 --> 02:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
and if you step outside of that source
 
02:35:53.429 --> 02:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
then you are not then you need to redo
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
your assignment
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:35:59.190 --> 02:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
02:36:01.270 --> 02:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative ellison thank you mr
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
question i just want to be clear that
 
02:36:07.270 --> 02:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
that that i that i think i heard you
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
correctly so maybe you can clarify this
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
for me okay did you just say that racism
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
a topic that should be discussed in
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
public school or school classrooms i
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
think that they should be teaching
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
how racism looks because what they're
 
02:36:23.910 --> 02:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
doing is in the divisive concepts
 
02:36:26.550 --> 02:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're not presenting the facts they're
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
going back and they're and you i'm sure
 
02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
you heard what i read for the questions
 
02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
correct with the they gave them two
 
02:36:35.910 --> 02:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
sources to go to and then they followed
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
up and the whole
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
point and this is this is one example
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
you know i was trying to show you kind
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
of what is going on in the classroom is
 
02:36:46.630 --> 02:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
that the teachers are coming in whether
 
02:36:49.349 --> 02:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
it's israel and palestine or whatever
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
the conflict is they're presenting it in
 
02:36:54.870 --> 02:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
a way that says one of them was an
 
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
oppressor and one of them was oppressed
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
and several times my children have come
 
02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
home from school in
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
many conflicts throughout history and
 
02:37:05.590 --> 02:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
said this was the good one this was the
 
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
bad one
 
02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
bad one
and

02:37:07.670 --> 02:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're doing it in a 45-minute video
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
with some follow-up questions
 
02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
and my concern is they shouldn't be
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
presenting information in a way that
 
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow them to understand all the
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
facts and do critical thinking and
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
understand what really happened in
 
02:37:23.439 --> 02:37:25.510 align:start position:0%
understand what really happened in
history

02:37:25.510 --> 02:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:37:26.950 --> 02:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.750 --> 02:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
bowman thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
jama for coming in again
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
do you can you tell me
 
02:37:38.479 --> 02:37:39.510 align:start position:0%
do you can you tell me
what

02:37:39.510 --> 02:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:41.190 align:start position:0%
what
nationality

02:37:41.190 --> 02:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
nationality
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
in the world pretty much has not been
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
discriminated against talking about
 
02:37:48.469 --> 02:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
germans irish italians
 
02:37:50.150 --> 02:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that there's any and
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's why i said it's worldwide the
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
problem is is that a lot of these
 
02:37:55.830 --> 02:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
teachers are saying it's only happening
 
02:37:57.830 --> 02:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
in america and they're not giving an
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
accurate representation of what's
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
happening all over the world
 
02:38:03.349 --> 02:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
they said something like
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know all americans are living on
 
02:38:07.349 --> 02:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
stolen land one of the teachers did and
 
02:38:09.830 --> 02:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
i said all across the world everyone's
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
living on stolen land
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
but they're not presenting it that way
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
and it's not right
 
02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:18.070 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
sources primary sources or so i i have
 
02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
not done much information into or i
 
02:39:02.070 --> 02:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
haven't done a lot of research into
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
those specifically i um the
 
02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:06.389 align:start position:0%
those specifically i um the
biography.com

02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
biography.com
 
02:39:09.110 --> 02:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
was another source that my daughter was
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
told was the only one she could go to
 
02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:12.150 align:start position:0%
told was the only one she could go to
and

02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
it was um i found it to be very generic
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
i found only certain dates and only
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
certain resources or papers listed that
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
they wrote so it's not giving it's
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
basically putting people in a box and
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
saying this is what we want to share
 
02:39:29.830 --> 02:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
about them
 
02:39:32.309 --> 02:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
for instance she was studying john dewer
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
and he was the first president of the
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
teachers union and he had studied in
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
china and the soviet union
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
about communism and she
 
02:39:44.230 --> 02:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
did more research into it and said this
 
02:39:45.990 --> 02:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
is where he had done his education these
 
02:39:48.150 --> 02:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
are the papers that he wrote and that's
 
02:39:50.150 --> 02:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
when she was stopped by that specific
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
teacher saying
 
02:39:53.110 --> 02:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to share that
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
information because it doesn't go along
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
with the assignment that we're trying to
 
02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:57.590 align:start position:0%
with the assignment that we're trying to
present

02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
so any free thinking outside of that i'm
 
02:40:01.270 --> 02:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
not i can't
 
02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know specifically speak to those two
 
02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
but i think it's wrong that they're not
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
having children go and do their own
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
research and if there's credible sources
 
02:40:14.950 --> 02:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
or you know or non-credible sources they
 
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
should have debates about it and they
 
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
should find ways to have them do more
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
research because there are good and bad
 
02:40:21.279 --> 02:40:22.309 align:start position:0%
research because there are good and bad
um

02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
sources out there
 
02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.550 align:start position:0%
sources out there
but

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:40:31.030 --> 02:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
narcina thank you very much thank you uh
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
jonathan weinberg are you on are you
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
going like this again
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure we got to this
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing in time while you're here
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
um my name is jonathan weinberg i'm a
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
member of the concord school board uh
 
02:40:56.950 --> 02:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
but while i'm here in my capacity as an
 
02:40:58.550 --> 02:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
individual i'm not speaking on behalf of
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
i see how house bill 1576 is critical
 
02:41:04.790 --> 02:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislation for many aspects but firstly
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
to combat the fear and teachers that
 
02:41:07.590 --> 02:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
they will be reported for merely
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
teaching history
 
02:41:10.790 --> 02:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
as we all surely know the group mobs for
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
liberty placed a bounty on teachers
 
02:41:14.070 --> 02:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
heads if they were found guilty of
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
teaching so-called divisive concepts
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
if this wasn't enough to make educators
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
weary concurrently the state of new
 
02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire instituted a snitch system
 
02:41:23.670 --> 02:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
where parents and individuals could
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
report educators who violated the
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
recently passed divisive concepts
 
02:41:27.840 --> 02:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
recently passed divisive concepts
legislation

02:41:29.349 --> 02:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
yet outside of the legislative chambers
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
it appears no one can really define what
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
divisive concepts are
 
02:41:38.070 --> 02:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
last summer as a member of the city and
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
community relations committee on the
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
concord school board i represented the
 
02:41:43.110 --> 02:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
board with fellow members at a booth
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
every saturday by the state house
 
02:41:47.670 --> 02:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
this created a unique opportunity to
 
02:41:49.349 --> 02:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
engage with constituents and community
 
02:41:50.950 --> 02:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
members outside of a formal meeting
 
02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
members outside of a formal meeting
setting

02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
setting
 
02:41:54.790 --> 02:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
as expected we received many questions
 
02:41:56.469 --> 02:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
about back to school
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
but the most common questions were about
 
02:42:01.830 --> 02:42:01.840 align:start position:0%
if we taught crt or critical race theory
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
or even what the so-called new divisive
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
concepts are
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
one of the main questions i inquired of
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
those asking was what do they define as
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
critical race theory then individuals
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
would typically say
 
02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
that is when you make white people hate
 
02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:18.389 align:start position:0%
that is when you make white people hate
themselves

02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
and what was even more staggering was
 
02:42:21.910 --> 02:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
when someone said to me
 
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
it is basically a new version of slavery
 
02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
i was taken aback by this claim that
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
critical race theory was slave slavery
 
02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.630 align:start position:0%
critical race theory was slave slavery
reincarnated

02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
reincarnated
 
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
i want to recommend the book the new jim
 
02:42:34.550 --> 02:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
crow by michelle alexander
 
02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
as that provides another view on what a
 
02:42:39.030 --> 02:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
new iteration of slavery is
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
yet that would unfortunately most likely
 
02:42:43.030 --> 02:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
fall under the forbidden books list
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
other times people make comments
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
equating critical race theory to nazi
 
02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:47.590 align:start position:0%
equating critical race theory to nazi
propaganda

02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
propaganda
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
as not only an individual in education
 
02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
but especially as a jewish person to
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
hear these comments comparing the
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
teaching of history to a time when my
 
02:42:56.150 --> 02:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather was in a concentration
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
camp is despicable
 
02:42:59.830 --> 02:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
we live in a state where critical race
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
theory has become an umbrella term for
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
everything it is not
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
a misnomer
 
02:43:06.790 --> 02:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
and what is even more tragic is how the
 
02:43:08.230 --> 02:43:08.240 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and state
 
02:43:09.830 --> 02:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature have only fanned the flames
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
of misinformation as they legitimized
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
the misidentification of critical race
 
02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
theory as either not to propaganda or
 
02:43:17.349 --> 02:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
encouraging people to suggest that it is
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
a new age of slavery this must stop i
 
02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:22.399 align:start position:0%

my head

i feel that my own group's history
 
02:44:46.630 --> 02:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
obligates me in gratitude to be a civic
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
leader in this country and i carry
 
02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:50.230 align:start position:0%

as a member of both a religious minority

earlier in my career i had the
 
02:44:58.469 --> 02:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create from scratch a
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
course for high school juniors about
 
02:45:03.510 --> 02:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
america in place of the typical us
 
02:45:06.790 --> 02:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
ap history and literature curriculum
 
02:45:08.710 --> 02:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
i was working at a private jewish high
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
school and together with a colleague we
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
set out to give our students
 
02:45:14.710 --> 02:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary tools
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
to look at american history and culture
 
02:45:19.590 --> 02:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
and to look at themselves as critical
 
02:45:22.469 --> 02:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
citizens connected critics to use the
 
02:45:24.870 --> 02:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
terminology of the political philosopher
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
michael waltzer
 
02:45:29.269 --> 02:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
perhaps this was natural for us as jews
 
02:45:31.429 --> 02:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
a group who have so often
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
lived the american dream and a group so
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
often the targets of violence and
 
02:45:38.389 --> 02:45:38.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination even in this country even
 
02:45:40.389 --> 02:45:40.399 align:start position:0%
just a couple weeks ago
 
02:45:42.150 --> 02:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
but what we did in that school was to
 
02:45:44.469 --> 02:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
prototype a concept with application far
 
02:45:46.469 --> 02:45:46.479 align:start position:0%
beyond our specific group and the
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
private school setting and i have to say
 
02:45:51.349 --> 02:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen anything quite like it
 
02:45:53.190 --> 02:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm proud that the alums of that course
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
have become those connected and critical
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
citizens working in everything from our
 
02:46:00.630 --> 02:46:00.640 align:start position:0%
national defense and intelligence to
 
02:46:02.389 --> 02:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
representing the under represented
 
02:46:04.710 --> 02:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
before our u.s supreme court
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
facing all of our story as a nation in
 
02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
an honest and questioning spirit only
 
02:46:11.590 --> 02:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
fueled their engagement and their
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
intense dedication to our country their
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
resilience to keep working on problems
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
especially in times of crisis in their
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
lives from 9 11 through now
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
how will we motivate our public school
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
students to locate themselves as
 
02:46:27.910 --> 02:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
creators of a more perfect union
 
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
how is it possible to draw lessons about
 
02:46:33.349 --> 02:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
the dynamics between one's own ideals
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and group pressure
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
if you don't learn about the
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
three-fifths compromise and sit for a
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
while in shame and embarrassment as well
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
as understanding of political strategy
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the times
 
02:46:46.150 --> 02:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
how is it possible for our students to
 
02:46:48.469 --> 02:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
learn about the inner challenges of
 
02:46:50.710 --> 02:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
leadership what it's like to sit where
 
02:46:53.190 --> 02:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
you sit where we hope they will one day
 
02:46:55.590 --> 02:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
sit and want to unless they can probe
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
thomas jefferson in both his idealism
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
and his cowardice
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
why bother reading thorough if we don't
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
allow students to take seriously his
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
indictments of the nation and even of
 
02:47:06.950 --> 02:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
his own friends
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
how can we study twain without asking
 
02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
whether he was lampooning the racism of
 
02:47:14.550 --> 02:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
his time or swept up in it
 
02:47:16.469 --> 02:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
sometimes as teachers we have to make
 
02:47:18.550 --> 02:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure that a perspective that was or is
 
02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
in our history that is so opposite of
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
what a patriot teacher like me would
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
ever want to entertain or say out loud
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
is made vivid and alive in our class
 
02:47:30.950 --> 02:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
so students know what's at stake
 
02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
slaveholder perspective stalinist
 
02:47:35.429 --> 02:47:35.439 align:start position:0%
perspective so it can be addressed in
 
02:47:37.349 --> 02:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
the safe and trusting container of our
 
02:47:37.359 --> 02:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
the safe and trusting container of our
classrooms

02:47:39.190 --> 02:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
02:47:41.429 --> 02:47:41.439 align:start position:0%
if the creators of divisive concepts
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
laws such as the existing one are
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about this country lapsing
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
into an unpatriotic socialism well it is
 
02:47:50.710 --> 02:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
the hallmark of socialist dictatorships
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
to write laws that hide their
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
implications behind innocent words to
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
sow doubt about whether you or someone
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
else is breaking the law to create a
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
situation where an official or another
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
citizen can take legal action against
 
02:48:06.630 --> 02:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
you or just threaten to do that which is
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
exactly as we know what's happened in
 
02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and elsewhere with such
 
02:48:13.030 --> 02:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
laws members of my jewish community have
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
lived under such laws in our era in
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
other lands which is why they came here
 
02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
i've had conversations with people
 
02:48:22.550 --> 02:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
running for school board or attending
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
their meetings they happened at my kids
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
school it's in my american neighborhood
 
02:48:29.670 --> 02:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
and there's never any actual incident of
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
a teacher declaring that someone is
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
inherently racist or that america is
 
02:48:36.550 --> 02:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
i've heard of a few times i can't tell
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
you the name of the school i'm trying to
 
02:48:41.110 --> 02:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
make sure it doesn't happen here i would
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
like to talk however to my my fellow
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
parents about the the context of that
 
02:48:47.830 --> 02:48:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation because i think it's important
 
02:48:50.070 --> 02:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
to get into cases like that
 
02:48:51.750 --> 02:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
but the current law seems to be like
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
this and it doesn't sound like the
 
02:48:55.510 --> 02:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
american constitution to me
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
if that is now how if that is not how
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
you intended the current law then
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
consider my remarks to be high school
 
02:49:03.190 --> 02:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
teacher comments on an essay whose
 
02:49:06.469 --> 02:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
thesis is confusing it needs a revision
 
02:49:08.309 --> 02:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you are serious about education for a
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
proud and patriotic american citizenship
 
02:49:13.750 --> 02:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
not just for diversity but unity a
 
02:49:16.389 --> 02:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
difficult unity and i hope that you are
 
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
then show you are serious by getting
 
02:49:20.790 --> 02:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
engaged with the fine work of our social
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
studies leaders and our civic education
 
02:49:25.750 --> 02:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
thinkers pump more substantive standards
 
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
into our system as you've tried to do in
 
02:49:30.790 --> 02:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
the holocaust and genocide law invest in
 
02:49:32.389 --> 02:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
the resources and training for our
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
educators around critical citizenship
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and a true patriotism
 
02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
and in the meantime take these current
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
words out of the laws and pass hb 1576.
 
02:49:44.710 --> 02:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and i would be
 
02:49:47.269 --> 02:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
happy to respond to any questions
 
02:49:49.830 --> 02:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
do do you have a copy of the uh what you
 
02:49:52.150 --> 02:49:52.160 align:start position:0%
just read available for the clerk here
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:00.389 --> 02:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.349 --> 02:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh i hope i'm not redundant when i thank
 
02:50:20.389 --> 02:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
you for your service you are the most
 
02:50:22.790 --> 02:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
unpaid underpaid i would say
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
citizen volunteers and thank you for the
 
02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
hours that you put in
 
02:50:28.309 --> 02:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
i have to be before i make my remarks i
 
02:50:29.750 --> 02:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
have to address
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh this mom who spoke a couple minutes
 
02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:32.550 align:start position:0%
uh this mom who spoke a couple minutes
ago

02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
i am a retired uh
 
02:50:39.510 --> 02:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:50:43.670 --> 02:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
teachers should be facilitators
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
and never
 
02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
create that kind of bias
 
02:50:50.469 --> 02:50:50.479 align:start position:0%
in some of the questions that they ask
 
02:50:52.150 --> 02:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
right the greatest compliment a teacher
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
can receive
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
and i and maybe once in my tenure a
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
student asked me so what do you believe
 
02:50:59.120 --> 02:50:59.910 align:start position:0%
student asked me so what do you believe
right

02:50:59.910 --> 02:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:51:01.429 --> 02:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
should never be the subject in the
 
02:51:01.439 --> 02:51:03.429 align:start position:0%
should never be the subject in the
classroom

02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
02:51:03.439 --> 02:51:04.710 align:start position:0%
classroom
um

02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:06.309 --> 02:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
i support the current bill in the
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
previous one for the following reasons
 
02:51:10.550 --> 02:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
one and it's been discussed before
 
02:51:12.469 --> 02:51:12.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a state that believes
 
02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
in local control
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
therefore let us trust
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
our local superintendents and principals
 
02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
to maintain a high imbalance caliber of
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
teaching within their schools
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
if we have
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
an occasional teacher
 
02:51:29.030 --> 02:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
that perhaps has gone over the line let
 
02:51:30.790 --> 02:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
the principals handle that i don't think
 
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
the state needs to handle it
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
two truth be known
 
02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
instructing at the high school level
 
02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
means intersecting with four or five
 
02:51:41.030 --> 02:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
sections of day
 
02:51:43.269 --> 02:51:43.279 align:start position:0%
of reluctant learners
 
02:51:45.910 --> 02:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps you've forgotten your teen years
 
02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
but is unlikely that you came to class
 
02:51:52.389 --> 02:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
all five or six a day ready to learn
 
02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
instead it is a task of every educator
 
02:51:57.030 --> 02:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
to build energy and intellectual
 
02:51:57.040 --> 02:51:58.469 align:start position:0%
to build energy and intellectual
interest

02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
interest
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
teenagers by their nature want something
 
02:52:03.590 --> 02:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
they can relate to that has relevance to
 
02:52:05.429 --> 02:52:05.439 align:start position:0%
their lives
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
often something they can debate
 
02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
talking about dead people and concepts
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
from the 18th century
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
are not a central focus for teens who
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
get most of their information from tick
 
02:52:16.800 --> 02:52:17.590 align:start position:0%
get most of their information from tick
tock

02:52:17.590 --> 02:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
tock
 
02:52:20.469 --> 02:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
that's the reality
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
so a teacher's challenge then is to make
 
02:52:24.469 --> 02:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
the classroom come alive to invest it
 
02:52:27.030 --> 02:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
with facts and ideas that both educate
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and entice
 
02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
you need to give us the freedom and
 
02:52:33.429 --> 02:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
trust to do that
 
02:52:34.630 --> 02:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
imagine for a moment that we're
 
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
discussing declaration of independence
 
02:52:38.950 --> 02:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
it might be a fascinating subject for
 
02:52:41.830 --> 02:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
the adults in this room but not so much
 
02:52:44.070 --> 02:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
for a 16 year old
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
how to make it come alive knowing that
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
it will engage students in one class
 
02:52:51.510 --> 02:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps that technique will flop in the
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
next teachers need to have the freedom
 
02:52:56.950 --> 02:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be nimble and spontaneous
 
02:52:59.910 --> 02:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
mention taxation without representation
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
and watch eyes glaze over
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
all right instead it might be more
 
02:53:06.630 --> 02:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
interesting to ask them
 
02:53:08.710 --> 02:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
if it was fair for england to impose
 
02:53:10.630 --> 02:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
taxes for a war that they fought in
 
02:53:10.640 --> 02:53:12.389 align:start position:0%
taxes for a war that they fought in
america

02:53:12.389 --> 02:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
america
 
02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
and that their english brethren paid
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
higher taxes than they did
 
02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:18.150 align:start position:0%
higher taxes than they did
right

02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
it might be an effective piece so then
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
to ask is taxation without
 
02:53:26.230 --> 02:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
representation a piece of disinformation
 
02:53:28.309 --> 02:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
and to wake a teenager up you might even
 
02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.640 align:start position:0%
say fake news
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
as a question not a statement
 
02:53:36.389 --> 02:53:36.399 align:start position:0%
to students
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
why should we have taxes anyway asked
 
02:53:40.469 --> 02:53:40.479 align:start position:0%
another student are we allowed to talk
 
02:53:42.230 --> 02:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
about in the classroom socialists
 
02:53:44.469 --> 02:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
finland and sweden where education and
 
02:53:48.150 --> 02:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
medical costs are not crippling expenses
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
not in the testimony of the bill i heard
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago
 
02:53:53.349 --> 02:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
or another example
 
02:53:55.750 --> 02:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
why did jefferson delete from his
 
02:53:58.469 --> 02:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
initial draft of the declaration and
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
what did he delete
 
02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:02.150 align:start position:0%
what did he delete
answer

02:54:02.150 --> 02:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't know it was on slavery a
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
condemnation of slavery
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
so should the ensuing discussion be
 
02:54:10.160 --> 02:54:11.269 align:start position:0%
so should the ensuing discussion be
limited

02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
limited
 
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
fearful of saying something deemed
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
un-american or ideological
 
02:54:18.230 --> 02:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
or rather should it ask the question
 
02:54:19.990 --> 02:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
why do we think he deleted that
 
02:54:22.230 --> 02:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
paragraph what might it tell us about
 
02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
america at the time
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
what might it tell us about the context
 
02:54:28.790 --> 02:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
that these politicians and founders were
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
our institute is to get our challenges
 
02:54:36.070 --> 02:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
to get students to think more deeply to
 
02:54:38.469 --> 02:54:38.479 align:start position:0%
be critical and fair thinkers
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
in reality as a as a teacher you're
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find a middle ground between
 
02:54:43.750 --> 02:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
your passion
 
02:54:45.670 --> 02:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging youth's limited
 
02:54:45.680 --> 02:54:46.870 align:start position:0%
and acknowledging youth's limited
experience

02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
experience
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
the beauty of history and i used to say
 
02:54:51.190 --> 02:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
this to my students all the time is 20
 
02:54:53.030 --> 02:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
years from now you'll love it
 
02:54:56.309 --> 02:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
right it's nuances in its complexity
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
but we do them in injustice if we do not
 
02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
explore the complexity and the
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
contradictions of jefferson and even
 
02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:05.510 align:start position:0%
contradictions of jefferson and even
lincoln

02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
lincoln
 
02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
i want my students not only to
 
02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand but operate but appreciate
 
02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:10.870 align:start position:0%
understand but operate but appreciate
operating

02:55:10.870 --> 02:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
operating
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
in the context of their times and
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
importantly how these issues of the 18th
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
and 19th and 20th century
 
02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
are not merely history
 
02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
but a continuum of an experiment called
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
the american experience
 
02:55:26.630 --> 02:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
the study of history is a conversation
 
02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
where we should be the umpire with its
 
02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
many twists and turns
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
let us as a state be self-confident
 
02:55:35.190 --> 02:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
enough to be self-critical let us be
 
02:55:36.630 --> 02:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
trusting enough to believe in our
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
teachers who beyond i think health care
 
02:55:41.830 --> 02:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
workers have had the most difficult time
 
02:55:43.590 --> 02:55:43.600 align:start position:0%
in this pandemic
 
02:55:45.429 --> 02:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
let us create an educational template
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
that will encourage young people to
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
become teachers encourage teaching
 
02:55:50.309 --> 02:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
professionals to want to be in the state
 
02:55:51.590 --> 02:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
02:55:57.269 --> 02:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
yes represent lakers
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:05.269 --> 02:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
i noticed your comment um
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
initially about what the
 
02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
one of the former
 
02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
speakers was talking about
 
02:56:14.870 --> 02:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
and you agreed that teachers should not
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
be doing that am i correct no no i would
 
02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
say the way the questions were asked i
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
think teachers
 
02:56:22.550 --> 02:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
i for example would have given out a
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
primary source instead of a secondary
 
02:56:25.990 --> 02:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
source right i certainly wouldn't
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
discourage a student from finding
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
additional sources i mean to me
 
02:56:32.150 --> 02:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know if i wouldn't get uh fired i'd
 
02:56:33.670 --> 02:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
give that student a hug for bringing in
 
02:56:35.190 --> 02:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
additional sources
 
02:56:38.790 --> 02:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
so so my question then is
 
02:56:42.389 --> 02:56:42.399 align:start position:0%
if a teacher is doing that and is
 
02:56:42.399 --> 02:56:43.590 align:start position:0%
if a teacher is doing that and is
limiting

02:56:43.590 --> 02:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
students responses and a student's
 
02:56:47.910 --> 02:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
research etc
 
02:56:50.070 --> 02:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
what do you think should be
 
02:56:53.349 --> 02:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
do you think anything should be done
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:56:56.469 --> 02:56:56.479 align:start position:0%
every profession
 
02:56:59.030 --> 02:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
we continue to learn
 
02:56:59.040 --> 02:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
we continue to learn
so

02:56:59.910 --> 02:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
my reaction to that is if i were a
 
02:57:03.670 --> 02:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
parent i would bring my concern to the
 
02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:04.630 align:start position:0%
parent i would bring my concern to the
principal

02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
principal
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
or the dean and let's have a
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
conversation with the teacher
 
02:57:10.469 --> 02:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
about what they're teaching and how
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're teaching it i don't know if
 
02:57:13.269 --> 02:57:13.279 align:start position:0%
that's a young teacher i don't know if
 
02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's an experienced teacher but um
 
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
not to watch too poetic but i mean
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
teaching's an art form
 
02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
and it can always be improved on
 
02:57:25.030 --> 02:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
so that's what i would have done with
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
her concern thank you yeah
 
02:57:29.190 --> 02:57:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:31.110 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative

02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for coming i'm
 
02:57:35.269 --> 02:57:35.279 align:start position:0%
over here thank you thank you for coming
 
02:57:37.590 --> 02:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
and sharing uh the wonderful story that
 
02:57:38.550 --> 02:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
you did
 
02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:39.670 align:start position:0%
you did
um

02:57:39.670 --> 02:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you would also uh
 
02:57:43.279 --> 02:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if you would also uh
agree

02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:45.110 align:start position:0%
agree
that

02:57:45.110 --> 02:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:57:47.429 --> 02:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
um a new teacher
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
or a teacher who feels that they're
 
02:57:51.429 --> 02:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
under the constraints of a vague law
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
like we have
 
02:57:53.760 --> 02:57:56.309 align:start position:0%
like we have
might

02:57:56.309 --> 02:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:58.230 --> 02:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
resort to
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
framed questions from a workbook
 
02:58:01.120 --> 02:58:02.389 align:start position:0%
framed questions from a workbook
or

02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:58:05.590 --> 02:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps limit sources just uh as a
 
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
because they don't
 
02:58:09.190 --> 02:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
because teaching is an art form and you
 
02:58:11.510 --> 02:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
actually i'm sure
 
02:58:13.030 --> 02:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
taught differently at the end of your
 
02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
career than you did the first or second
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
day of your career
 
02:58:18.710 --> 02:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
and maybe talk to that if you could
 
02:58:20.230 --> 02:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
please no thank you for the question and
 
02:58:22.230 --> 02:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right right i mean i
 
02:58:24.309 --> 02:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm glad there's no video of me as a
 
02:58:25.670 --> 02:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
young teacher
 
02:58:25.680 --> 02:58:27.750 align:start position:0%
young teacher
um

02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:29.590 --> 02:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
i think that that that it may have come
 
02:58:31.190 --> 02:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
from the workbook and i i mean i don't
 
02:58:33.510 --> 02:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
want to miss my message here i
 
02:58:35.910 --> 02:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
i i think our teachers our young
 
02:58:37.750 --> 02:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
teachers our experienced teachers can't
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
go into the classroom looking over their
 
02:58:41.269 --> 02:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
shoulders they can't
 
02:58:43.750 --> 02:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
i mean some of the best teaching is a
 
02:58:47.429 --> 02:58:47.439 align:start position:0%
question that you did not expect
 
02:58:49.830 --> 02:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
and you know as a good teacher you need
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
to turn that around probably at first
 
02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
glance back to the classroom
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
as a neutral question but i can't at the
 
02:58:59.670 --> 02:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
moment that i'm trying to take these
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
reluctant learners and they are keep
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
them engaged and energetic and then at
 
02:59:05.269 --> 02:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
the same time thinking is that a
 
02:59:07.269 --> 02:59:07.279 align:start position:0%
question i can respond to
 
02:59:09.990 --> 02:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i i think we have to be careful there
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we want to get overwhelmed
 
02:59:15.990 --> 02:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
by if there are teachers out there
 
02:59:19.510 --> 02:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
teaching ideology they shouldn't be
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what we're doing as
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
a profession
 
02:59:27.110 --> 02:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:59:29.269 --> 02:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for coming in today and
 
02:59:31.429 --> 02:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
sharing your wisdom are you welcome it's
 
02:59:33.349 --> 02:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
good to be old
 
02:59:37.510 --> 02:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
02:59:54.150 --> 02:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
committee my name is michael o'brien
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
here on behalf of aft new hampshire i am
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist with party strategies
 
03:00:02.070 --> 03:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
here today in support of this bill
 
03:00:05.349 --> 03:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
after new hampshire was one of
 
03:00:07.269 --> 03:00:07.279 align:start position:0%
the folks who filed a lawsuit
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
because our members were getting from
 
03:00:10.230 --> 03:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
our members that the law was vague
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
enough that they were concerned about
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
how they should teach and what they
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
should teach and how they should
 
03:00:17.510 --> 03:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
approach their lessons and it was
 
03:00:19.990 --> 03:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
causing them to step back from important
 
03:00:21.990 --> 03:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
topics that need to be discussed in the
 
03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:23.670 align:start position:0%
topics that need to be discussed in the
classroom

03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
03:00:25.190 --> 03:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony from
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
president deb howes and so i'm going to
 
03:00:28.469 --> 03:00:28.479 align:start position:0%
keep this pretty short i do want to say
 
03:00:30.070 --> 03:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
this is personal for me on a separate
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
level my wife is a history teacher i
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
have four children one of whom is now
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
old enough to be in school the other
 
03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
three who will get there soon um and i
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
want them to learn those concepts and my
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
my wife as a history teacher wants to be
 
03:00:44.150 --> 03:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
able to teach
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
students so that they can learn and grow
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
and these are high school students who
 
03:00:50.070 --> 03:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
she wants to challenge right and wants
 
03:00:52.150 --> 03:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
them to think critically about important
 
03:00:52.160 --> 03:00:53.110 align:start position:0%
them to think critically about important
issues

03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:00:56.550 --> 03:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
and and i see her as we talk about the
 
03:00:59.429 --> 03:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
struggles of teachers
 
03:01:01.269 --> 03:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think i work pretty hard
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
i work
 
03:01:05.190 --> 03:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
it pales in comparison to how hard my
 
03:01:07.269 --> 03:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
wife's job has been and how hard she has
 
03:01:09.269 --> 03:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
worked over the past three years and
 
03:01:11.349 --> 03:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
really ever since i've known her but
 
03:01:12.550 --> 03:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
these past three years have been
 
03:01:14.309 --> 03:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
exceptionally difficult and when people
 
03:01:15.990 --> 03:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
have questions about material or
 
03:01:17.750 --> 03:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
something that she wants that she has
 
03:01:19.670 --> 03:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
presented in the classroom she spends
 
03:01:21.510 --> 03:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
hours a night answering emails from
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
students and parents alike she is
 
03:01:25.269 --> 03:01:25.279 align:start position:0%
accessible she is there to answer
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions and to help to guide these
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
students and these parents through any
 
03:01:31.670 --> 03:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions they may have the idea that
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
teachers are not accessible now in in
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
this day and age is one of fallacy right
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
each teacher has an email
 
03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
these emails are there to be answered
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
they answer these emails i see her again
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
spend hours into the night answering
 
03:01:46.389 --> 03:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
these so
 
03:01:48.630 --> 03:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
from an aft perspective the law causes
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
our members
 
03:01:51.670 --> 03:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
significant apprehension around topics
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
they should be teaching from a personal
 
03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:54.389 align:start position:0%
they should be teaching from a personal
perspective

03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
it is hard for me to see my wife with
 
03:01:57.750 --> 03:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
the work that she puts in and then be
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
questioned the way that i think this
 
03:02:01.750 --> 03:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
committee sort of questions educators in
 
03:02:04.389 --> 03:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
general around these topics and so for
 
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:06.560 align:start position:0%
that we support this bill i'm happy to
 
03:02:08.550 --> 03:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%

03:02:25.590 --> 03:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
particularly teachers who teach social
 
03:02:25.600 --> 03:02:27.349 align:start position:0%
particularly teachers who teach social
studies

03:02:27.349 --> 03:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
studies
 
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
or history
 
03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:30.870 align:start position:0%
or history
um

03:02:30.870 --> 03:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:33.030 --> 03:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
a handful of short videos from the
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
department of education in connection
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
with black history month

with black history month
um

03:02:41.030 --> 03:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:45.190 --> 03:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
and particularly in view of
 
03:02:48.550 --> 03:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
what's currently in statute in these two
 
03:02:50.590 --> 03:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
areas and one um
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:54.880 --> 03:02:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
would

03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
would would it be your opinion that that
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
not you know
 
03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
not not only just with the statutes in
 
03:03:11.750 --> 03:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
place but now being provided specific
 
03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:13.429 align:start position:0%
place but now being provided specific
curriculum

03:03:13.429 --> 03:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
that that that touches on this area that
 
03:03:17.190 --> 03:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
that would
 
03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
be seen as a broadening um uh
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity for teachers or something
 
03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:24.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity for teachers or something
that

03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
would could be considered as narrowing
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
um the the curriculum being taught for
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
example this is what you should show
 
03:03:33.590 --> 03:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
your students
 
03:03:35.030 --> 03:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question and i
 
03:03:37.190 --> 03:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
think that will depend largely on the
 
03:03:38.469 --> 03:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
teacher and i think there will be
 
03:03:39.830 --> 03:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
teachers who will see this as this is
 
03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
what i should be instructing uh for sure
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
right and i think again it depends on
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
the teacher's tenure and how long and
 
03:03:47.030 --> 03:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
how comfortable they are in the
 
03:03:49.269 --> 03:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
classroom and um how comfortable they
 
03:03:51.190 --> 03:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
are with the law as written right and
 
03:03:51.200 --> 03:03:52.550 align:start position:0%
are with the law as written right and
maybe

03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
03:03:55.190 --> 03:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
to some teachers will be that you know
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
last year a law was passed that said
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
that i am not fully understanding and
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
that makes me
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
be cautious of what i am teaching and
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
now i'm getting something that this is
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
my fill in the blank um and i think
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
those videos and i've watched the ones
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
that were out um
 
03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
that were out um
are

03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
need questions afterwards right they
 
03:04:16.230 --> 03:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
need context so why these folks uh
 
03:04:17.429 --> 03:04:17.439 align:start position:0%
booker t washington created these
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
schools right and
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
but why was difficult that he did that
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
that question wasn't posed in those
 
03:04:23.990 --> 03:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
videos and that can be added that's not
 
03:04:25.750 --> 03:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
a shot at the video but just to say
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
teachers can add context to those videos
 
03:04:29.030 --> 03:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
but some probably wouldn't feel
 
03:04:30.550 --> 03:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable under the this law as
 
03:04:32.790 --> 03:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
written so
 
03:04:37.429 --> 03:04:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
i will
 
03:04:40.550 --> 03:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to understand the
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
vagueness of the law so
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
you've heard the things your your wife
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
has said etc can you enlighten me in
 
03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
what it is about the law that
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
she isn't understanding
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh i would leave her to to to do that i
 
03:04:56.950 --> 03:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
will just say that when i read her the
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
the guidance that came from
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
um the doe and from the ag she uh still
 
03:05:04.230 --> 03:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
had significant questions about where
 
03:05:06.070 --> 03:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
that line was and she's been doing this
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
for a while now um and so she's not you
 
03:05:11.190 --> 03:05:11.200 align:start position:0%

those questions thank you
 
03:05:14.870 --> 03:05:14.880 align:start position:0%

03:05:29.190 --> 03:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:05:37.590 --> 03:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:39.990 --> 03:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
members of the house education committee

i want to thank you for taking my
testimony

03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
my name is andrew benfield i'm a
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
resident of northampton in new hampshire
 
03:05:49.510 --> 03:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm also parental rights advocate in the
 
03:05:51.590 --> 03:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
state many of you know me so i've been
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
doing this for quite a while my focus is
 
03:05:57.590 --> 03:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
on academic excellence and education
 
03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we saw an influx of the
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
radicalized critical race theory
 
03:06:04.630 --> 03:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
training for teachers
 
03:06:07.110 --> 03:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
and curriculum aimed at children in
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
03:06:10.469 --> 03:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
this came in under the umbrella of
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion and
 
03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.349 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion and
justice

03:06:13.349 --> 03:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
justice
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
it was so alarming to teachers and
 
03:06:17.830 --> 03:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
children that many of them mobilized to
 
03:06:19.630 --> 03:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
affirm our civil rights through the
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory language that was
 
03:06:23.910 --> 03:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
passed in hb2
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
we saw teacher training in sau 16 that
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
described everyone
 
03:06:30.710 --> 03:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
as white supremacists
 
03:06:32.469 --> 03:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
if they believed in the color blind
 
03:06:32.479 --> 03:06:33.670 align:start position:0%
if they believed in the color blind
society

03:06:33.670 --> 03:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
society
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
similar to what this
 
03:06:37.349 --> 03:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor brought up just a few minutes
 
03:06:37.359 --> 03:06:38.230 align:start position:0%
sponsor brought up just a few minutes
ago

03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:06:39.590 --> 03:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
he would like to see a colorblind
 
03:06:42.389 --> 03:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
society guess what according to
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
teacher training under two revolutions
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
that would be considered white
 
03:06:51.190 --> 03:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:53.429 --> 03:06:53.439 align:start position:0%
we had parents assuring their children
 
03:06:55.349 --> 03:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
that they were not responsible for
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
slavery after receiving
 
03:06:59.910 --> 03:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
a lesson in history that placed the
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
actions of slave owners on young
 
03:07:06.710 --> 03:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
children sitting in our classrooms today
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
i've talked to these parents
 
03:07:10.790 --> 03:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
i sent you
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
my testimony via email you will see her
 
03:07:16.230 --> 03:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
post on social media where she has to
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
console her young daughter
 
03:07:21.110 --> 03:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
that she is not responsible for slavery
 
03:07:22.830 --> 03:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire
 
03:07:22.840 --> 03:07:24.790 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire
parent

03:07:24.790 --> 03:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
parent
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
these are violations of the civil rights
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
act but parents and teachers do not want
 
03:07:30.630 --> 03:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
to have to take their school district to
 
03:07:32.630 --> 03:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
court there are costs involved and it
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
can be a lengthy process as we are
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in sau 16 right now
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
the district has taxpayer-funded
 
03:07:42.070 --> 03:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys at their disposal so it can be
 
03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
a daunting task to spend thousands of
 
03:07:43.840 --> 03:07:44.710 align:start position:0%
a daunting task to spend thousands of
dollars

03:07:44.710 --> 03:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
on a private attorney to fight for our
 
03:07:49.349 --> 03:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
basic civil rights
 
03:07:51.910 --> 03:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
currently there is an ongoing lawsuit
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
sau 16 where a resident is just trying
 
03:07:57.110 --> 03:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
to compile documents to look at how crt
 
03:07:59.670 --> 03:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
was implemented in the school district
 
03:08:02.309 --> 03:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
residents are already already uncovered
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
information that shows that they were
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
planning to push more bias and prejudice
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
on students
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
the superintendent is using
 
03:08:11.030 --> 03:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded school district
 
03:08:13.269 --> 03:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
attorneys to fight against produce
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
producing these documents and when i
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
filed the right to no request the last
 
03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:18.630 align:start position:0%
filed the right to no request the last
time

03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:08:19.910 --> 03:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
they had already spent ten thousand
 
03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
dollars on their attorney fees fighting
 
03:08:25.429 --> 03:08:25.439 align:start position:0%
in court to produce these documents
 
03:08:27.910 --> 03:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
we do know that sau 16 purchased books
 
03:08:30.309 --> 03:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
for the students on anti-racism
 
03:08:32.710 --> 03:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
anti-racism includes the same toxicity
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
toxicity as the radicalized critical
 
03:08:36.790 --> 03:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
race theory that we are seeing in public
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
schools today
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
for instance in the book sau 16
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
purchased for 8th grade children the
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
author says that you
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
all of us are in two categories
 
03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.200 align:start position:0%

if you don't fit into this class you're
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the subordinate culture
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
those in the subordinate culture
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%

a student or teacher must then determine

which of those two box boxes that
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
student fits in
 
03:09:28.229 --> 03:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
and this is why condoleezza rice
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
rejected this whole notion
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
and she said it on the view if you go
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:09:36.389 --> 03:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
in my um
 
03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
testimony to you i i put the link in
 
03:09:38.720 --> 03:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
testimony to you i i put the link in
there

03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
and she talks about how we are
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
discussing race relations in the
 
03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
classroom today she disagreed with
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
requiring white people to feel guilty
 
03:09:48.710 --> 03:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
for everything that has happened in the
 
03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
for everything that has happened in the
past

03:09:49.990 --> 03:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
she mentions one of the most important
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
features of crt which is the idea
 
03:09:56.870 --> 03:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
that black people have to feel
 
03:09:56.880 --> 03:09:59.110 align:start position:0%
that black people have to feel
disempowered

03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
disempowered
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
she rejects this worldview and goes on
 
03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
to say that she wants black kids to be
 
03:10:04.550 --> 03:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
completely empowered
 
03:10:06.150 --> 03:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
to know that they are beautiful in their
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
blackness what a wonderful statement
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
but in order to do that she doesn't want
 
03:10:13.269 --> 03:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
to make white kids feel bad for being
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
white which is what we're seeing in new
 
03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:16.790 align:start position:0%
white which is what we're seeing in new
hampshire

03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:10:19.429 --> 03:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
condoleezza rice just summed up why crt
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
agenda is wrong for students in new
 
03:10:20.960 --> 03:10:22.229 align:start position:0%
agenda is wrong for students in new
hampshire

03:10:22.229 --> 03:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
while this may be wrong the crt deij
 
03:10:31.830 --> 03:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
anti-racist agenda also violates our
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
basic civil rights
 
03:10:36.309 --> 03:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
those rights were affirmed in hb2 with
 
03:10:39.990 --> 03:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
the anti-discrimination language
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
why would anyone think it's okay to
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate against any group of people
 
03:10:45.670 --> 03:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
based on their skin color
 
03:10:47.990 --> 03:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
why would we want to go backwards
 
03:10:50.070 --> 03:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
why would you not want to affirm our
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
civil rights of all the children in
 
03:10:52.080 --> 03:10:53.190 align:start position:0%
civil rights of all the children in
teachers

03:10:53.190 --> 03:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
in our public schools because i've heard
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
from teachers too now will you get them
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
here absolutely not they're not going to
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
put their job on the line
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
but they are getting pressure from the
 
03:11:04.150 --> 03:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
administrators bringing in the
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
03:11:08.790 --> 03:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of discriminatory behavior has
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
been happening in many other schools
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
like litchfield sanborn
 
03:11:16.950 --> 03:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
exeter hollis brookline and hopkinton to
 
03:11:18.710 --> 03:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
name a few
 
03:11:20.630 --> 03:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
parents have set up websites you can
 
03:11:23.110 --> 03:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
find the link in your email
 
03:11:24.870 --> 03:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
facebook pages have objected to this
 
03:11:27.349 --> 03:11:27.359 align:start position:0%
discriminatory behavior at school board
 
03:11:29.990 --> 03:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
meetings hb2 has helped those parents
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
and teachers require their school
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
administrators to go back to focusing on
 
03:11:37.349 --> 03:11:37.359 align:start position:0%
academic achievement for all of their
 
03:11:37.359 --> 03:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
academic achievement for all of their
students

03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
teachers are in a very difficult
 
03:11:43.269 --> 03:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
position speaking publicly but hb2 has
 
03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
also helped them so they are not just
 
03:11:48.389 --> 03:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
subjected to this kind of hate and
 
03:11:51.429 --> 03:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
prejudice from professional development
 
03:11:54.469 --> 03:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
it was david ryan superintendent of sau
 
03:11:56.710 --> 03:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
16 who admitted
 
03:11:58.790 --> 03:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
in a public meeting that they would have
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
to change their professional development
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
because of this anti-discriminatory law
 
03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
the professional development and sau 16
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
provided by two revolutions
 
03:12:11.590 --> 03:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
was questioned at a public meeting when
 
03:12:13.510 --> 03:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
somebody asked about the professional
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
development the east kingston teachers
 
03:12:18.630 --> 03:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
had to endure
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
and i give you a link to where he makes
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
this public statement
 
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
according to two revolutions teachers
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
and children are covert racists and
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
white supremacists if they are number
 
03:12:30.640 --> 03:12:31.830 align:start position:0%
white supremacists if they are number
one

03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:12:33.269 --> 03:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the belief that we should be
 
03:12:35.990 --> 03:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
colorblind when judging someone
 
03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
number two if we are silent and we don't
 
03:12:39.269 --> 03:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
speak up
 
03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
number three are white parents
 
03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%

03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and schools
 
03:12:47.110 --> 03:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
live in an area where education funding
 
03:12:50.229 --> 03:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
is from property taxes
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
supports the message of make great make
 
03:12:54.389 --> 03:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
america great again denies white
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
privilege believes in exceptionalism you
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
are a white supremacist that's what the
 
03:13:01.110 --> 03:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
teachers were learning
 
03:13:03.830 --> 03:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
celebrates columbus day
 
03:13:06.229 --> 03:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
claims reverse racism
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
assumes good intentions are enough
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
believes that we're all one big human
 
03:13:13.269 --> 03:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
family there's only one human race
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're a white supremacist
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of professional
 
03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
development we have seen in new
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire schools this is not training
 
03:13:22.309 --> 03:13:22.319 align:start position:0%
that is focused on helping students
 
03:13:24.550 --> 03:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
succeed academically but training
 
03:13:26.469 --> 03:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
teachers to blame and shame their
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues and the children in their
 
03:13:31.510 --> 03:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
care and i heard from teachers who have
 
03:13:33.590 --> 03:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
been blamed and shamed by their
 
03:13:33.600 --> 03:13:35.190 align:start position:0%
been blamed and shamed by their
colleagues

03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
03:13:36.950 --> 03:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
for their white supremacists and they
 
03:13:40.469 --> 03:13:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
the teachers in sau 16 were subjected to
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
professional development by two
 
03:13:46.229 --> 03:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
revolutions who was hired to work with
 
03:13:47.510 --> 03:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
the teachers
 
03:13:50.389 --> 03:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
according to two revolutions if you live
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
in an area that funds public education
 
03:13:54.229 --> 03:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
through property taxes you are a white
 
03:13:54.239 --> 03:13:55.510 align:start position:0%
through property taxes you are a white
supremacist

03:13:55.510 --> 03:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
supremacist
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
that would mean that every resident in
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a white supremacist
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
including all of you
 
03:14:03.110 --> 03:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
sitting on this committee
 
03:14:04.710 --> 03:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
if children happen to be in a
 
03:14:06.950 --> 03:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
subordinate culture remember you're in
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
two you're one or the two children may
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
begin viewing themselves as abnormal and
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
inferior that's what condoleesa rice was
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
how is it good for black how is that
 
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
good for black and brown children
 
03:14:21.670 --> 03:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
condoleezza rice said it best when she
 
03:14:23.670 --> 03:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
said she wanted black and brown children
 
03:14:25.830 --> 03:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
to feel empowered and beautiful in their
 
03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:27.190 align:start position:0%
to feel empowered and beautiful in their
blackness

03:14:27.190 --> 03:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
blackness
 
03:14:29.670 --> 03:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
what a wonderful statement
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
there are many more examples i can share
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
but i think you can see the kind of
 
03:14:34.950 --> 03:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
destructive bias we saw in new hampshire
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
schools prior to the passage of
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 this was damaging to teachers and
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
children in our public schools
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
there is now a way for parents and
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
teachers to fight back against the
 
03:14:46.469 --> 03:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
prejudice aimed at them
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be used as a political
 
03:14:50.710 --> 03:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
tool by political radicals our schools
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
should be focused on academic excellence
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and literacy in the core subjects
 
03:14:57.830 --> 03:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
that is how you uplift all children
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is how you support public schools
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons i ask you to reject
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
or to vote itl on 1576 which would also
 
03:15:10.469 --> 03:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
include hb 1090.
 
03:15:12.389 --> 03:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
that concludes my um
 
03:15:13.590 --> 03:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
03:15:15.269 --> 03:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
testimony but i would like to go back
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
and just talk about a couple of things
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
somebody brought up the book stamped i
 
03:15:21.670 --> 03:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
think it was megan tuttle brought up
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
this book stamp that um
 
03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
it's being um
 
03:15:27.190 --> 03:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
possibly removed in some of these
 
03:15:29.110 --> 03:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
classes let me tell you about the book
 
03:15:29.120 --> 03:15:30.389 align:start position:0%
classes let me tell you about the book
stamped

03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
stamped
 
03:15:33.269 --> 03:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
okay it's written by ibram x kendi and i
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
was contacted by a hopkinson parent who
 
03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
said that her daughter was required to
 
03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
read this book the entire year she
 
03:15:40.550 --> 03:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
removed her daughter from school by the
 
03:15:40.560 --> 03:15:41.269 align:start position:0%
removed her daughter from school by the
way

03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
because that's what these things do is
 
03:15:44.070 --> 03:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
they they cause parents to remove their
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
kids from schools
 
03:15:48.550 --> 03:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
ibra makes kendi in that book admits
 
03:15:50.389 --> 03:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
because i read the book that he is not a
 
03:15:50.399 --> 03:15:51.670 align:start position:0%
because i read the book that he is not a
historian

03:15:51.670 --> 03:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
historian
 
03:15:52.950 --> 03:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
he's giving
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
historical parts he's talking about
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
historical events
 
03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
and for instance the parent who actually
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
read the book
 
03:16:01.510 --> 03:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
said that
 
03:16:03.349 --> 03:16:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's misleading information in that
 
03:16:03.359 --> 03:16:04.389 align:start position:0%
there's misleading information in that
book

03:16:04.389 --> 03:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
book
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
about the louisiana purchase for
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
instance maybe he's left out information
 
03:16:10.469 --> 03:16:10.479 align:start position:0%
um things like that so some of these
 
03:16:13.590 --> 03:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
books that may be removed may be removed
 
03:16:15.590 --> 03:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
because if you're teaching history you
 
03:16:17.349 --> 03:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
want it actually authentic and maybe
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
taught by a historian
 
03:16:22.229 --> 03:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
or somebody who knows the subject
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
and so while he may have his views
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's great but
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
if you're if your child's in a class in
 
03:16:30.229 --> 03:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
a history or social studies class maybe
 
03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
you want authentic history maybe you
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
want the full picture
 
03:16:35.269 --> 03:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
fiction picture being told
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
and ibrahmax candy said
 
03:16:39.269 --> 03:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
in a tweet
 
03:16:41.190 --> 03:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
some white colonizers adopted black
 
03:16:43.349 --> 03:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
children they civilized these savage
 
03:16:45.429 --> 03:16:45.439 align:start position:0%
children in the superior ways of white
 
03:16:45.439 --> 03:16:46.309 align:start position:0%
children in the superior ways of white
people

03:16:46.309 --> 03:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
while using them as props and their
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
lifelong pictures of denial while
 
03:16:49.760 --> 03:16:50.710 align:start position:0%
lifelong pictures of denial while
cutting

03:16:50.710 --> 03:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
the biological parents of these children
 
03:16:55.990 --> 03:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
out of the picture of humanity so maybe
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
maybe the book is being removed because
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
of a political activist book in the in a
 
03:17:02.950 --> 03:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
history class versus somebody who
 
03:17:04.469 --> 03:17:04.479 align:start position:0%
actually wants to teach the subject and
 
03:17:05.990 --> 03:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
teach it well
 
03:17:08.790 --> 03:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so what kind of chilling effect does
 
03:17:10.950 --> 03:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
this have did this have
 
03:17:12.790 --> 03:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
well as rebecca said
 
03:17:14.550 --> 03:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire parent
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
i just can't my nine-year-old asked me
 
03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
this weekend if slavery was her fault
 
03:17:20.469 --> 03:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
because she's a white person
 
03:17:22.389 --> 03:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
we have an open question answer about
 
03:17:25.030 --> 03:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
anything and she is super interested in
 
03:17:27.110 --> 03:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
rosa parks and the underground railroad
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
we happened to be in boston when she
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
asked this one i guess we pro i guess we
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably need to separate a separate
 
03:17:35.670 --> 03:17:35.680 align:start position:0%
facebook page look in her eyes thinking
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
that slavery was her our fault
 
03:17:40.550 --> 03:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
is crushing
 
03:17:41.910 --> 03:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's what the parents said and that is
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
included in your in your email to you
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
so that's the chilling effect so i'm not
 
03:17:48.710 --> 03:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
sure what the answer is i don't
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
um because as i read as i read the
 
03:17:54.150 --> 03:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
actual language in the discriminatory
 
03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:55.110 align:start position:0%
actual language in the discriminatory
law

03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
it focuses on discrimination it means
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't blame and shame kids don't blame
 
03:17:59.830 --> 03:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
and shame
 
03:18:02.070 --> 03:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
teachers that you don't know
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how that's difficult
 
03:18:07.590 --> 03:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
to implement in the classroom
 
03:18:09.990 --> 03:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know somebody said trust let's trust
 
03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:10.870 align:start position:0%
you know somebody said trust let's trust
well

03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
i can give you so many examples of
 
03:18:15.190 --> 03:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
if it these teachers don't want to
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes teach it this way but the
 
03:18:18.630 --> 03:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
administrators have brought it in in
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
professional development said this is
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do so you can take
 
03:18:24.070 --> 03:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
it to the trust like i mean quite
 
03:18:25.910 --> 03:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
frankly i trust this guy back here
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
teaching the kids i mean what he
 
03:18:29.349 --> 03:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
explained i think is what most people
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
would want out of a social studies
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
teacher but that's not what we're seeing
 
03:18:35.590 --> 03:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're seeing please do
 
03:18:38.309 --> 03:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
your research this has been going on for
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
the past year i know
 
03:18:42.710 --> 03:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
i don't really think i have anything
 
03:18:44.790 --> 03:18:44.800 align:start position:0%
other than that to say but
 
03:18:46.630 --> 03:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
other than if you're going to repeal
 
03:18:48.389 --> 03:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
anything then you better fix this
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
problem in the process because it won't
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
be fixed if you repeal it
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:59.750 --> 03:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative porter thank you mr
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:19:02.950 --> 03:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
question ms beansville were you present
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the professional development um
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities that the teachers had in
 
03:19:10.550 --> 03:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
your sau that you talked about that were
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
so upsetting where these things were
 
03:19:13.510 --> 03:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
said and done
 
03:19:15.590 --> 03:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
no i was not at the actual professional
 
03:19:17.510 --> 03:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
development what we did is we we
 
03:19:19.670 --> 03:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
obtained information we detained
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
documents on what two revolutions
 
03:19:24.150 --> 03:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
provides and i provided that to you in
 
03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.710 --> 03:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
there is a um as you'll see in your
 
03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:33.670 align:start position:0%
there is a um as you'll see in your
email

03:19:33.670 --> 03:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
email
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
there is a um pyramid
 
03:19:39.510 --> 03:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
pyramid of overt white supremacy which
 
03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
is socially unacceptable and covert
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
white supremacy which is socially
 
03:19:45.030 --> 03:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
acceptable and so you can see what is
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
provided to the teachers through two
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
revolutions they were the ones that were
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
hired to do the professional development
 
03:19:50.960 --> 03:19:51.910 align:start position:0%
hired to do the professional development
so

03:19:51.910 --> 03:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:19:53.590 --> 03:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is what this is the documents that
 
03:19:55.990 --> 03:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
they put out this is what they say this
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
is what we do as an organization
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:20:13.190 --> 03:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
hi thank you mr chair for taking my
 
03:20:18.229 --> 03:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is louise spencer
 
03:20:20.469 --> 03:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
i am here speaking on my own behalf i
 
03:20:23.110 --> 03:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
live in concord but i am part of the
 
03:20:24.950 --> 03:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
kent street coalition
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
which is an all volunteer grassroots
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
advocacy group
 
03:20:31.349 --> 03:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i am confident that
 
03:20:33.030 --> 03:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:20:35.030 --> 03:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
folks in that group would agree that
 
03:20:35.040 --> 03:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
folks in that group would agree that
these

03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:20:38.710 --> 03:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
bills that we support these bills
 
03:20:42.469 --> 03:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
and that we would like to see um
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
the language that was passed in sb2 to
 
03:20:47.269 --> 03:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
be overturned
 
03:20:49.590 --> 03:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking here today as a parent
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
whose children went through
 
03:20:53.830 --> 03:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
concord public schools
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
and also as someone who spent most of my
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
educational experience in public schools
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
growing up
 
03:21:00.640 --> 03:21:02.150 align:start position:0%
growing up
and

03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
i had a range of
 
03:21:04.560 --> 03:21:06.550 align:start position:0%
i had a range of
teachers

03:21:06.550 --> 03:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's not impos it's not possible for
 
03:21:12.309 --> 03:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
people to totally
 
03:21:15.190 --> 03:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
sanitize and sterilize their experience
 
03:21:16.790 --> 03:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
from who they are
 
03:21:19.830 --> 03:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
when they enter into the classroom
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
could be aware that some were
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
conservative in their perspective some
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
were more liberal in their perspectives
 
03:21:30.710 --> 03:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
some were religious some perhaps not
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
variety of racial
 
03:21:36.550 --> 03:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
backgrounds ethnicities
 
03:21:39.030 --> 03:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
and life experiences
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
including diversity of socioeconomic
 
03:21:41.279 --> 03:21:43.269 align:start position:0%
including diversity of socioeconomic
experiences

03:21:43.269 --> 03:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
experiences
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
those things enriched my education
 
03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
those things enriched my education
that

03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
was profound
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
how i learned and how i
 
03:21:57.190 --> 03:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
grew as a person
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i i find it very sad that we're
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
trying to to
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
really remove that richness of
 
03:22:09.190 --> 03:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
experience from our classrooms
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's one of our greatest
 
03:22:10.880 --> 03:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
i think it's one of our greatest
strengths

03:22:12.950 --> 03:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
strengths
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
as a country is that we are lucky to
 
03:22:16.239 --> 03:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
as a country is that we are lucky to
have

03:22:17.190 --> 03:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
such a diverse experience and i do not
 
03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
i also had a wide range of
 
03:22:31.030 --> 03:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
fellow students again the same range of
 
03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
experiences again that was enriching my
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:38.880 --> 03:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:22:39.910 --> 03:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:42.150 --> 03:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
i often heard in school
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
things that i did not agree with or that
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
i wasn't taught at home
 
03:22:48.950 --> 03:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
my children heard such things in school
 
03:22:50.550 --> 03:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:22:53.190 --> 03:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
they came home and we discussed it and
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
it made for a rich and engaging
 
03:22:55.439 --> 03:22:57.190 align:start position:0%
it made for a rich and engaging
conversation

03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
it helped them grow
 
03:23:00.870 --> 03:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
it helped me grow as a child and i'm
 
03:23:02.710 --> 03:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
grateful to my parents that what that
 
03:23:06.229 --> 03:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
one experience that comes to mind for my
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
daughter was she was in a civics class
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
in high school and was
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
was election day and the teacher said
 
03:23:19.750 --> 03:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
kids asked when are you going to vote
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the teacher said oh i only vote in
 
03:23:23.269 --> 03:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
presidential elections the rest of
 
03:23:25.590 --> 03:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
elections are a waste of time
 
03:23:27.510 --> 03:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
my daughter came home quite appalled by
 
03:23:27.520 --> 03:23:28.389 align:start position:0%
my daughter came home quite appalled by
this

03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
sit by this comment rightly so
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
she and i had a long discussion along
 
03:23:35.590 --> 03:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
with my husband about it and how she
 
03:23:38.229 --> 03:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
might approach that with the teacher
 
03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
um or if she wanted us to engage the
 
03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:42.389 align:start position:0%
um or if she wanted us to engage the
teacher

03:23:42.389 --> 03:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
she chose to go and speak with the
 
03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
she chose to go and speak with the
teacher

03:23:45.590 --> 03:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
03:23:48.070 --> 03:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
it became a topic of conversation in the
 
03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:49.429 align:start position:0%
it became a topic of conversation in the
classroom

03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
and an opportunity for for exploration
 
03:23:55.110 --> 03:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
it turned into a very rich and powerful
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
experience rather than what is so often
 
03:24:00.150 --> 03:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
portrayed as a negative one
 
03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.870 align:start position:0%
portrayed as a negative one
um

03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
the other thing that strikes me as i
 
03:24:06.790 --> 03:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
find it ironic
 
03:24:06.800 --> 03:24:07.670 align:start position:0%
find it ironic
that

03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
the underlying law
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and seeking to
 
03:24:11.920 --> 03:24:13.670 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about and seeking to
repeal

03:24:13.670 --> 03:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
03:24:15.830 --> 03:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
will make it
 
03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
so much more likely
 
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
that sources that students can reference
 
03:24:23.670 --> 03:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
will be limited
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's one of the very purposes of the
 
03:24:29.110 --> 03:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill is to put restrictions on what's
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
available to students to explore and
 
03:24:34.309 --> 03:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
discuss and discover
 
03:24:36.630 --> 03:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
so we've already heard about
 
03:24:38.229 --> 03:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
books that might be pulled from the
 
03:24:39.990 --> 03:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
classroom or books that might not be
 
03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:41.269 align:start position:0%
classroom or books that might not be
approved

03:24:41.269 --> 03:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
approved
 
03:24:43.269 --> 03:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
if i were a teacher teaching i will want
 
03:24:46.630 --> 03:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
to make pretty darn sure that when i
 
03:24:48.550 --> 03:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
03:24:51.910 --> 03:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:53.590 --> 03:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
that i that i direct directed my
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
students to certain um
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
websites and resources
 
03:25:00.309 --> 03:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
lest i be
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
accused of somehow um
 
03:25:05.830 --> 03:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
bringing in things that were not
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
considered acceptable to be discussed
 
03:25:11.590 --> 03:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
i also know that as a student
 
03:25:14.309 --> 03:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
at all levels of my education
 
03:25:14.319 --> 03:25:15.510 align:start position:0%
at all levels of my education
especially

03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
especially
 
03:25:18.790 --> 03:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
as i'm thinking from middle school on
 
03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:19.990 align:start position:0%
as i'm thinking from middle school on
but

03:25:19.990 --> 03:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:22.070 --> 03:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
throughout my education i was encouraged
 
03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
to look at things from different
 
03:25:25.990 --> 03:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
perspectives and often i was given
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
assignments to write not from my own
 
03:25:28.399 --> 03:25:29.830 align:start position:0%
assignments to write not from my own
perspective

03:25:29.830 --> 03:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:30.630 align:start position:0%
perspective
but

03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:25:32.950 --> 03:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
that from another person how it might
 
03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
feel to have been an immigrant to this
 
03:25:35.600 --> 03:25:36.550 align:start position:0%
feel to have been an immigrant to this
country

03:25:36.550 --> 03:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
how it might have felt to be
 
03:25:42.790 --> 03:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.830 --> 03:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
someone who was escaping the holocaust
 
03:25:49.110 --> 03:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get students to think about
 
03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
someone's experience other than their
 
03:25:53.590 --> 03:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
own life experience
 
03:25:55.750 --> 03:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
that may mean that certain resources are
 
03:25:58.229 --> 03:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
limited to the student or certain
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
things being introduced into an essay
 
03:26:02.229 --> 03:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
may not actually
 
03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
address the assignment as given
 
03:26:07.590 --> 03:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's important that we understand that
 
03:26:10.550 --> 03:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
what the teacher is trying to teach when
 
03:26:13.030 --> 03:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
a certain assignment is given
 
03:26:14.710 --> 03:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
and i think if we have any question
 
03:26:17.190 --> 03:26:17.200 align:start position:0%
about the ambiguity of this law we need
 
03:26:19.990 --> 03:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
only look at the testimony today it was
 
03:26:21.510 --> 03:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
all over
 
03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
all over
the

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
place quite frankly about whether this
 
03:26:27.510 --> 03:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
was about limiting whether it meant that
 
03:26:27.520 --> 03:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
was about limiting whether it meant that
we

03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:26:30.630 --> 03:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
and by the law i mean the law as it
 
03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
currently exists doesn't mean we can't
 
03:26:35.269 --> 03:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
teach about racism does it mean we can't
 
03:26:37.990 --> 03:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
teach about what racism looked like in
 
03:26:41.110 --> 03:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
the past is it about crt is it about
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion
 
03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's disingenuous when we are
 
03:26:49.110 --> 03:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
asked to deny the
 
03:26:51.910 --> 03:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
the origins of this particular bill and
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
the language
 
03:26:55.429 --> 03:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
from which it arose
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
which was hb 544
 
03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
the divisive concept spill
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
upon which
 
03:27:05.910 --> 03:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
chris ruffo came in and spoke and was
 
03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
very clear about the ties to divisive
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
language and i think the effort to make
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
the language more ambiguous
 
03:27:14.469 --> 03:27:14.479 align:start position:0%
quite frankly is to make it more
 
03:27:16.229 --> 03:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to really have an on
 
03:27:19.110 --> 03:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
honest conversation about what this bill
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
actually is attempting to do because no
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot go by it word by word and
 
03:27:26.469 --> 03:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
point to a specific thing in it that's
 
03:27:28.550 --> 03:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
the very point
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's the overall impact of this bill and
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're hearing it here today
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
it it's the chilling effect and that's
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill and it's not
 
03:27:41.349 --> 03:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
contained in any particular word it's
 
03:27:43.349 --> 03:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
contained in the way it's played out
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's contained in the way that
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
there are bounties put on teachers
 
03:27:49.990 --> 03:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's contained in the way that if you go
 
03:27:51.990 --> 03:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
on social media and look
 
03:27:53.910 --> 03:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
you will find all kinds of
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
interpretations about what this bill
 
03:27:57.510 --> 03:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
means and i have to say if i were a
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
teacher i would that would make me very
 
03:27:59.520 --> 03:28:00.870 align:start position:0%
teacher i would that would make me very
nervous

03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
nervous
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
talk about lawsuits and being afraid of
 
03:28:03.040 --> 03:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
talk about lawsuits and being afraid of
those

03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
as a teacher i would
 
03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
be worried about having to defend myself
 
03:28:11.670 --> 03:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
and possibly losing my um
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
my livelihood so
 
03:28:13.439 --> 03:28:14.469 align:start position:0%
my livelihood so
um

03:28:14.469 --> 03:28:14.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony i thank you for
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
giving me the time to share it thank you
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
 
03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions from the
committee

03:28:21.510 --> 03:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:28:21.520 --> 03:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
committee
yes

03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:28:24.710 --> 03:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you ms cheer thank you for your
 
03:28:24.720 --> 03:28:27.429 align:start position:0%
thank you ms cheer thank you for your
testimony

03:28:27.429 --> 03:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.590 --> 03:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
there are communist
 
03:28:31.670 --> 03:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm a history guy and i hate to use
 
03:28:33.750 --> 03:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
the word communist because it conjures
 
03:28:35.670 --> 03:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
up joe mccarthy but let me get to it
 
03:28:37.910 --> 03:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
there are schools that have had
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
communist clubs
 
03:28:42.950 --> 03:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of the expressed dark
 
03:28:45.830 --> 03:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
communist doctrine is to replace our our
 
03:28:48.389 --> 03:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh existing structures with with
 
03:28:48.399 --> 03:28:49.429 align:start position:0%
uh existing structures with with
something

03:28:49.429 --> 03:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:28:49.439 --> 03:28:50.550 align:start position:0%
something
totally

03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
totally
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
different from what we have
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
so are you comfortable with communist
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
clubs in high schools
 
03:28:57.760 --> 03:28:59.429 align:start position:0%
clubs in high schools
um

03:28:59.429 --> 03:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:01.269 --> 03:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not i would have to look more
 
03:29:03.910 --> 03:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
carefully at the law but i think that
 
03:29:07.429 --> 03:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
schools in terms of clubs are are fairly
 
03:29:10.469 --> 03:29:10.479 align:start position:0%
limited in what they
 
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
when what students want to do on their
 
03:29:12.560 --> 03:29:13.750 align:start position:0%
when what students want to do on their
private

03:29:13.750 --> 03:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
private
 
03:29:13.760 --> 03:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
private
um

03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know after school in terms of clubs
 
03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
i i think that
 
03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
i would have to defer to the lawyers on
 
03:29:24.710 --> 03:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
that but i think there's a wide range
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:30.389 --> 03:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
considerations that schools have to take
 
03:29:32.950 --> 03:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not really up to me of whether i
 
03:29:35.590 --> 03:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
would be comfortable with that kind of a
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
club or not it's really about
 
03:29:39.359 --> 03:29:40.309 align:start position:0%
club or not it's really about
what

03:29:40.309 --> 03:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
the law
 
03:29:44.469 --> 03:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
provides because also you might have
 
03:29:46.229 --> 03:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
clubs that are
 
03:29:48.950 --> 03:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
religious clubs or other political
 
03:29:51.269 --> 03:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
perspectives if you start limiting one
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
perspective then you may well be getting
 
03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
into an area where you're limiting other
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
perspectives so i i would
 
03:30:01.429 --> 03:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
i can't really speak to what i would do
 
03:30:01.439 --> 03:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
i can't really speak to what i would do
about

03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
a club like that
 
03:30:05.190 --> 03:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
03:30:11.750 --> 03:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:14.309 --> 03:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony today um
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
and you talked about the chilling effect
 
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
on teachers do you think this has a
 
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
chilling effect on the kids in the
 
03:30:20.790 --> 03:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
classroom as well
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
i do i do and i
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think we have to think about all the
 
03:30:29.670 --> 03:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
kids in the classroom um
 
03:30:29.680 --> 03:30:30.790 align:start position:0%
kids in the classroom um
and

03:30:30.790 --> 03:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:30:32.950 --> 03:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ways in which
 
03:30:34.790 --> 03:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
they may feel
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
if they know a book's been pulled from
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
the classroom that has to do with lgbtq
 
03:30:40.640 --> 03:30:41.670 align:start position:0%
the classroom that has to do with lgbtq
issues

03:30:41.670 --> 03:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
issues
 
03:30:44.790 --> 03:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
and they're an lgbt kid cube
 
03:30:47.190 --> 03:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
um kid
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
how is that going to make that child
 
03:30:48.800 --> 03:30:49.670 align:start position:0%
how is that going to make that child
feel

03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
feel
 
03:30:49.680 --> 03:30:51.110 align:start position:0%
feel
um

03:30:51.110 --> 03:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:51.120 --> 03:30:51.830 align:start position:0%
um
i

03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:30:55.110 --> 03:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think any children should be
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.000 --> 03:31:01.429 align:start position:0%
 
with

03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:31:04.389 --> 03:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
the problems that adults current and
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
past have created
 
03:31:09.590 --> 03:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
on the other hand i think when a child
 
03:31:12.870 --> 03:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
asks a question like was i responsible
 
03:31:14.229 --> 03:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
for slavery
 
03:31:14.239 --> 03:31:15.110 align:start position:0%
for slavery
or

03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:31:17.670 --> 03:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
is there something wrong with me because
 
03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
i am lgbtq and i wanted to read that
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
book or
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
any number of questions that a child
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
might emerge from the classroom with
 
03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that hopefully
 
03:31:31.190 --> 03:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
they can have those conversations with
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
03:31:32.560 --> 03:31:33.510 align:start position:0%
their parents
um

03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
but i i think that
 
03:31:36.160 --> 03:31:37.269 align:start position:0%
but i i think that
it's

03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways children can be
 
03:31:39.600 --> 03:31:41.830 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of ways children can be
impacted

03:31:41.830 --> 03:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
03:31:43.590 --> 03:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
across the board
 
03:31:45.429 --> 03:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
based on their experiences and i think
 
03:31:46.630 --> 03:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
we have to be
 
03:31:48.389 --> 03:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
be careful and mindful of that but i
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
don't think a law like this
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
and when i keep saying a lot like this
 
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm referring to the underlying law
 
03:31:57.670 --> 03:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
does anything to help us address those
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
sorts of challenges that children might
 
03:32:01.750 --> 03:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
face growing up in this very difficult
 
03:32:03.269 --> 03:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
and challenging world
 
03:32:05.349 --> 03:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
and trying to seek answers
 
03:32:09.030 --> 03:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
so further questions represent allison
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question a follow-up to
 
03:32:13.190 --> 03:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative moffat's question
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh are you aware of any communist clubs
 
03:32:18.309 --> 03:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
in any schools in new hampshire i am not
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:24.630 --> 03:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
do we need any more questions on that
 
03:32:24.640 --> 03:32:29.349 align:start position:0%
do we need any more questions on that
topic

03:32:29.349 --> 03:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
okay we have a question right here
 
03:32:34.550 --> 03:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffat
 
03:32:36.630 --> 03:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
your famous chair uh
 
03:32:38.070 --> 03:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
03:32:39.510 --> 03:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned my
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
my question and i asked the question
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
03:32:45.670 --> 03:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
concord high school at least in the past
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen yearbooks where they have the
 
03:32:49.429 --> 03:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
communist club in the yearbook
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
so that caught my eye and i don't know
 
03:32:53.429 --> 03:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
it's in the euro it was i don't know if
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
it still is in the yearbook so that's
 
03:32:57.190 --> 03:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
where that question came from
 
03:32:59.670 --> 03:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
and it caught my eye and
 
03:33:02.229 --> 03:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
i my question is
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
what had to do with is a sanction is
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%

club
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
that i don't know if that's the case but
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's the question i and others have
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%

i'm here representing new futures i am
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
the children's behavioral health policy
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
coordinator there i did forget my badge
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
today i'm sorry
 
03:35:15.510 --> 03:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
new futures is a non-partisan non-profit
 
03:35:17.429 --> 03:35:17.439 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates educates and
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
collaborates to improve the health and
 
03:35:22.309 --> 03:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
wellness of all new hampshire residents
 
03:35:24.710 --> 03:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
new futures is also the new hampshire's
 
03:35:27.190 --> 03:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
authorized kids count organization and
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
so we
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
advocate for data-based policies that
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
support granite state families
 
03:35:35.429 --> 03:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
new futures stands in strong support of
 
03:35:38.309 --> 03:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
house bill 1576 and the previous bill
 
03:35:38.319 --> 03:35:40.469 align:start position:0%
house bill 1576 and the previous bill
1090.

03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
1090.
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would repeal the divisive
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
concepts bills that passed last year and
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
would allow granite state teachers
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
students and professionals to once again
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
discuss learn about and ultimately work
 
03:35:52.150 --> 03:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
to address many of the issues that
 
03:35:53.910 --> 03:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
directly impact the health and wellness
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
of granite staters
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
from a public health standpoint there is
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
a clear evidence that inequalities and
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
disparities disproportionately affect
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
people of color and women across new
 
03:36:07.030 --> 03:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is evidenced in
 
03:36:09.590 --> 03:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire fiscal policy institute
 
03:36:11.670 --> 03:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
data that we've cited in our written
 
03:36:11.680 --> 03:36:13.670 align:start position:0%
data that we've cited in our written
testimony

03:36:13.670 --> 03:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:36:15.349 --> 03:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
according to the u.s census bureau as
 
03:36:17.590 --> 03:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
well individuals across new hampshire
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
who identify as african-american
 
03:36:22.630 --> 03:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
hispanic or other communities of color
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
report significantly lower income and
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
higher poverty levels than the statewide
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
average these disparities extend across
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
to education child care housing and
 
03:36:35.590 --> 03:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
other social determinants of health
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
and they impact the health and wellness
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
of our entire state
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
to address these inequalities it's
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
important that students have the
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to learn about the systems
 
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
in place that
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
um that uh encourage these inequalities
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
and learn how to address them in a safe
 
03:36:53.279 --> 03:36:55.429 align:start position:0%
and learn how to address them in a safe
and

03:36:55.429 --> 03:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
controlled manner like in a classroom
 
03:37:00.630 --> 03:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
they're encouraged to just explore
 
03:37:02.710 --> 03:37:02.720 align:start position:0%
historical cultural and institutional
 
03:37:06.229 --> 03:37:06.239 align:start position:0%
forces that contribute to and reinforce
 
03:37:07.750 --> 03:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
these disparities
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
without learning about these issues and
 
03:37:11.910 --> 03:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
exploring them in the classroom
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
our citizens nor our state will be able
 
03:37:16.150 --> 03:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
to address them and we will not be able
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
to support all of our children and
 
03:37:19.910 --> 03:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
families to become safe healthy and
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
equitable place we hope new hampshire to
 
03:37:21.760 --> 03:37:22.870 align:start position:0%
equitable place we hope new hampshire to
be

03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
for these reasons new futures supports
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 1576 and encourages this
 
03:37:29.510 --> 03:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
03:37:31.910 --> 03:37:31.920 align:start position:0%

03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're italian this is 30 years ago in

rye
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
and um he looked at my wife and he said
 
03:39:01.349 --> 03:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
how about you she has red hair and blue
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
eyes irish looking but her last name was
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
scaglione that wasn't going to work
 
03:39:08.070 --> 03:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
either so neither to say we didn't move

to rye
 
03:39:10.870 --> 03:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is that's
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to i understand
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room i understand what
 
03:39:16.229 --> 03:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
they feel
 
03:39:16.239 --> 03:39:17.030 align:start position:0%
they feel
but

03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
but it's emotionally based right we all
 
03:39:21.110 --> 03:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
come through it this is the melting pot
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
this is america
 
03:39:25.110 --> 03:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
from one come many and that's what we
 
03:39:27.110 --> 03:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
really have to concentrate on
 
03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
from one many
 
03:39:31.590 --> 03:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i know a little bit about crt and
 
03:39:31.600 --> 03:39:33.030 align:start position:0%
and i know a little bit about crt and
deij

03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
deij
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a grandfather i take care of my
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
granddaughter and one of the big
 
03:39:39.189 --> 03:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
problems was when she came home one day
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
and she said you know what grandpa
 
03:39:43.110 --> 03:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't like being white i'm
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
like what are you talking about you
 
03:39:45.750 --> 03:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't like being white
 
03:39:47.590 --> 03:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't believe that and then then it
 
03:39:47.600 --> 03:39:48.950 align:start position:0%
i didn't believe that and then then it
was

03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:39:50.550 --> 03:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
the one that got me probably even worse
 
03:39:52.469 --> 03:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
was christopher columbus right
 
03:39:53.750 --> 03:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
christopher columbus didn't like
 
03:39:55.990 --> 03:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
christopher columbus anymore he's
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
she's 10 years old i'm like what are you
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
talking about so i took the time to go
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the school and look at curriculums
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
and go to school board meetings i had
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
never been involved before
 
03:40:09.830 --> 03:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i was horrified horrified to the
 
03:40:11.670 --> 03:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
fact that unfortunately i'm spending a
 
03:40:15.030 --> 03:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
small fortune in a lawsuit right now for
 
03:40:16.389 --> 03:40:16.399 align:start position:0%
a right to know
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
that has been incredibly a huge burden
 
03:40:20.870 --> 03:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
upon my family
 
03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
but it's impossible to get information
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things i did learn is that
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
the curriculums are not there what
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
happens is it's buried in the teacher
 
03:40:33.429 --> 03:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
training and the teacher training when
 
03:40:35.189 --> 03:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
you go look at the curriculum it's not
 
03:40:36.870 --> 03:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
what they're teaching it's
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
they teach the teachers to teach
 
03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
something else
 
03:40:43.429 --> 03:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
and this gentleman behind us i i would
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
do anything to have my granddaughter
 
03:40:47.830 --> 03:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
have a teacher like that
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
oh my god it would be fantastic
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the ideal ideology is
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
being taught to the teachers
 
03:40:57.750 --> 03:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's where the problem is that's
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
where it's happening i know it well i
 
03:41:02.150 --> 03:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
sit before you having to spending a
 
03:41:03.670 --> 03:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
small fortune
 
03:41:05.429 --> 03:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
to defend a right to no law in the state
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
03:41:10.150 --> 03:41:10.160 align:start position:0%

this is about our children and they
 
03:43:05.429 --> 03:43:05.439 align:start position:0%

that they are
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
oppressors or bad people
 
03:43:12.790 --> 03:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
based on immutable qualities we should
 
03:43:14.630 --> 03:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
not put up with treating our own kids
 
03:43:17.349 --> 03:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
the way that we would never stand for
 
03:43:20.469 --> 03:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
any other people's kids to be treated we
 
03:43:22.389 --> 03:43:22.399 align:start position:0%

you need to take responsibility for the
 
03:43:27.920 --> 03:43:29.269 align:start position:0%
you need to take responsibility for the
cannibalism

03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
cannibalism
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
and genocide that happened in your
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
country in your
 
03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:34.630 align:start position:0%
country in your
continent

03:43:34.630 --> 03:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
continent
 
03:43:36.870 --> 03:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
you know every
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
to put in a more personal level
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
everybody has a story
 
03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
everybody has a history what's important
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
is what you do with that history and i
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
don't think
 
03:43:51.110 --> 03:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
that any of this that's going on right
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
now i don't think it's accidental that
 
03:43:55.429 --> 03:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's happening when most of the world
 
03:43:57.510 --> 03:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
war ii vets are gone because i think
 
03:43:59.590 --> 03:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
they would be ashamed they would be
 
03:44:02.070 --> 03:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
ashamed of what is happening and that
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
americans are not standing up for
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
american principles
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
which is equality
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
everybody should be treated the same and
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
you should be rewarded or punished
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
on your own merits that's what america
 
03:44:15.279 --> 03:44:16.710 align:start position:0%
on your own merits that's what america
is

03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:44:19.189 --> 03:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
and when i have to talk to my
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
nine-year-old because he's in school
 
03:44:25.429 --> 03:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
and every book that he looks at
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%

03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
if there is a white person in it they're
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
a bad person
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
or they're stupid or they're doing
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
something wrong
 
03:44:41.030 --> 03:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
we would not stand for that
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
if it was a black
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
any other kind of person
 
03:44:50.550 --> 03:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
right now um
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's pretending and having this
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
like well what is crt it's so nebulous
 
03:44:58.870 --> 03:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's very clear and it's very simple the
 
03:45:01.349 --> 03:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
one thing to remember is crt is
 
03:45:05.269 --> 03:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
anti-white training it is training
 
03:45:07.990 --> 03:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
to disparage your own country
 
03:45:09.830 --> 03:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
and nobody should be disparaging your
 
03:45:12.389 --> 03:45:12.399 align:start position:0%
own country everybody has a history
 
03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
everybody has a story would you tell a
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
drug addict
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
you did some things so therefore you
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
have to suffer for the rest of your life
 
03:45:23.429 --> 03:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
or just go die you would never say that
 
03:45:26.790 --> 03:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
and our country as a whole we should be
 
03:45:29.429 --> 03:45:29.439 align:start position:0%
proud of what our history is
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
we've gone through so much
 
03:45:31.279 --> 03:45:34.070 align:start position:0%
we've gone through so much
um

03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
i really am imploring people to not fall
 
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:44.790 --> 03:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
we need to stand for our citizens and
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
stand for america um
 
03:45:50.309 --> 03:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
the one thing uh
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
that is observably true
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
is that since this crt
 
03:45:58.229 --> 03:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
has been brought up and being argued
 
03:45:58.239 --> 03:45:59.269 align:start position:0%
has been brought up and being argued
about

03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
violence against white people has
 
03:46:05.269 --> 03:46:05.279 align:start position:0%
increased by multiple factors of 100s
 
03:46:08.229 --> 03:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
just some small examples the waukesha
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
christmas parade which was clearly a
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
racial crime intended to kill as many
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
white people as possible
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
canon henat
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
a very small young boy who was murdered
 
03:46:23.269 --> 03:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
because he was white
 
03:46:26.389 --> 03:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
a boy named emmanuel was thrown from a
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
balcony in a mall
 
03:46:28.720 --> 03:46:30.309 align:start position:0%
balcony in a mall
um

03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:32.550 --> 03:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
a 12 year old boy was stabbed in the
 
03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
neck at mcdonald's standing in line by a
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
black man
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
all of these children were murdered
 
03:46:42.309 --> 03:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
by black people who have gone
 
03:46:45.269 --> 03:46:45.279 align:start position:0%
over the edge because they are receiving
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
this crt anti-white training which is
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
teaching them that all white people are
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
horrible all white people are bad
 
03:46:56.469 --> 03:46:56.479 align:start position:0%
um and policy makers are doing
 
03:46:59.189 --> 03:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
everything they can to disadvantaged
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
already marginalize and disenfranchise
 
03:47:04.150 --> 03:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
white people the largest population of
 
03:47:07.110 --> 03:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
people in america living in abject
 
03:47:09.910 --> 03:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
poverty are white people
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
so you want to have teachers
 
03:47:17.349 --> 03:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
telling these low-income white children
 
03:47:20.550 --> 03:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
and especially the little boys
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're not born nobody is born
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
an awful person
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
to be oh look
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%

03:47:32.309 --> 03:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i'm actually
 
03:47:34.550 --> 03:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
proud of white men i think white men
 
03:47:37.110 --> 03:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
have done great things in this world and
 
03:47:40.630 --> 03:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
what done great things in this country
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
they should be learning that's
 
03:47:44.710 --> 03:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
just as much as learning difficult
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
things nobody's talking about oh um
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're trying to ruin our freedom of
 
03:47:52.550 --> 03:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
speech no
 
03:47:54.150 --> 03:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know what we're talking about here
 
03:47:56.550 --> 03:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
is saying we as parents do not want
 
03:47:59.189 --> 03:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
teachers abusing our children ruining
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
their self-esteem
 
03:48:03.590 --> 03:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
and making them feel like
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's some original sin that they can
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
never get over jesus died on the cross
 
03:48:11.269 --> 03:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
because our sins are forgiven everyone's
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
sins are forgiven
 
03:48:14.630 --> 03:48:14.640 align:start position:0%

the other thing that ken is searchable
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
is that uh
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
this idea of diversity being the
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
greatest strength is actually the
 
03:48:38.550 --> 03:48:38.560 align:start position:0%
greatest weakness
 
03:48:38.560 --> 03:48:39.750 align:start position:0%

spoken people feel attacked
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
it is uncomfortable to hear our
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
experiences why
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%

experiences i ask you
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
if all of you are okay with the fact
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
that the majority of people opposing
 
03:54:56.469 --> 03:54:56.479 align:start position:0%

03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:08.550 --> 03:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
i believe in the goodness of humanity
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
let's put party lines aside today and
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%

we can get there but we can't get there
 
03:55:28.389 --> 03:55:28.399 align:start position:0%
if we're banning people from speaking
 
03:55:30.309 --> 03:55:30.319 align:start position:0%
their truths
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%

04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
to receive the differential aid
 
04:29:24.070 --> 04:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
under the law
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that's all it does
 
04:29:27.670 --> 04:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
just to make sure they still meet the
 
04:29:29.830 --> 04:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
requirements before they get their
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:47.269 --> 04:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
see you again uh it's how to follow that
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
it is just uh
 
04:29:50.790 --> 04:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
relative to this
 
04:29:50.800 --> 04:29:52.309 align:start position:0%
relative to this
uh

04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
what were you thinking that we didn't
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
include that the
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
verification for uh annual eligibility
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be just beyond differential
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
i mean if i understand the law correctly
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
which i may not but if i do
 
04:30:09.830 --> 04:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
they verify initially they verified for
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
the for the life of their program why
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to as well as uh this
 
04:30:17.830 --> 04:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
aid and any other aid and reduced lunch
 
04:30:19.429 --> 04:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
why would we want the law to be
 
04:30:21.269 --> 04:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
encompassing the the
 
04:30:24.149 --> 04:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
annual review of eligibility for
 
04:30:24.159 --> 04:30:25.189 align:start position:0%
annual review of eligibility for
financial

04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
financial
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
i i think i think that would be a good
 
04:30:27.439 --> 04:30:28.630 align:start position:0%
i i think i think that would be a good
idea

04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
idea
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
to annually check the eligibility
 
04:30:32.239 --> 04:30:34.389 align:start position:0%
to annually check the eligibility
from

04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
more than one point of view to make sure
 
04:30:38.630 --> 04:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
that they still qualify
 
04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
for their
 
04:30:43.830 --> 04:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
aid i think that would be a good idea if
 
04:30:47.189 --> 04:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
there's other types of aid besides the
 
04:30:47.199 --> 04:30:48.550 align:start position:0%
there's other types of aid besides the
lunch

04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
that look at those also
 
04:30:52.710 --> 04:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you chairman
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands
 
04:31:00.159 --> 04:31:01.030 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands
where

04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
oh waving way over there in the horizon
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
represent porter
 
04:31:07.110 --> 04:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
i told you guys put things in front of
 
04:31:07.120 --> 04:31:07.990 align:start position:0%
i told you guys put things in front of
me

04:31:07.990 --> 04:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
me
 
04:31:09.990 --> 04:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
so it can't be seen thank you
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
04:31:14.070 --> 04:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i understand all
 
04:31:16.070 --> 04:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking in this bill is if in the
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
first year
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
when a family makes an application
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
and they qualify for free and reduced
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
lunch that means the amount of the
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
voucher that they receive
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
would include
 
04:31:32.630 --> 04:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
a differential for being free and
 
04:31:34.389 --> 04:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they should check again the second
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
year to make sure right that they still
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
qualify for free and reduced lunch if
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:31:45.189 --> 04:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
all is copacetic if they don't
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
then they
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
then the amount of aid that they receive
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
might go down
 
04:31:54.550 --> 04:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct you never know um
 
04:31:57.910 --> 04:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
the um student or his family's income
 
04:31:59.429 --> 04:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
might change
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense to me to check
 
04:32:02.000 --> 04:32:03.990 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense to me to check
annually

04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
annually
 
04:32:04.000 --> 04:32:05.349 align:start position:0%
annually
um

04:32:05.349 --> 04:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
to see yeah yeah so in the public
 
04:32:08.080 --> 04:32:09.110 align:start position:0%
to see yeah yeah so in the public
schools

04:32:09.110 --> 04:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:32:11.110 --> 04:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
they do that every year
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
i believe so i i think so yeah you have
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
to put a new application in i i am i'm
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
fairly sure um
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
that the parents apply annually i'm
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that so it would be the same
 
04:32:27.670 --> 04:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
same as if if they were in the public
 
04:32:27.680 --> 04:32:28.710 align:start position:0%
same as if if they were in the public
school

04:32:28.710 --> 04:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:32:30.550 --> 04:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
not asking for any more to have it
 
04:32:34.630 --> 04:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes represents
 
04:32:40.790 --> 04:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
are you aware that every year the
 
04:32:40.800 --> 04:32:42.469 align:start position:0%
are you aware that every year the
um

04:32:42.469 --> 04:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
parents have to put in a new income
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
and all of their w-2s and whatever
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
every year and every year the
 
04:32:53.429 --> 04:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization does check
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
because that's how they determine how
 
04:32:57.590 --> 04:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
much money each student should get each
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
year and they do this already every year
 
04:33:03.429 --> 04:33:03.439 align:start position:0%
that could very well be the case i just
 
04:33:05.670 --> 04:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it's there that that
 
04:33:07.750 --> 04:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
the lunch is also included and all the
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
other things that they check
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
just seems like a fairness issue to me
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's what happens in the public schools
 
04:33:17.349 --> 04:33:17.359 align:start position:0%
and i would think this is an alternative
 
04:33:20.310 --> 04:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
type education that that the same
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
standard should apply
 
04:33:24.869 --> 04:33:24.879 align:start position:0%
to those that are taking advantage of
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
the education freedom account
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.670 --> 04:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
just trying to get a clarification and
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
you may or let me know i don't know i'm
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
not i'm not trying to probably just
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't know um because i was reading and
 
04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
i just heard what representative lika
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
said i was reading
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
lines four and five in this bill
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
and i thought in the efa account i may
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
be wrong and so i want to clarify here i
 
04:33:54.230 --> 04:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
thought in the efa accounts that that
 
04:33:57.109 --> 04:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
once a student was enrolled at the
 
04:33:59.349 --> 04:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
initial threshold within that 300 level
 
04:33:59.359 --> 04:34:00.470 align:start position:0%
initial threshold within that 300 level
threshold

04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
that income eligibility maintained
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
itself for the duration of the efa
 
04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
um i thought that's what it was and that
 
04:34:08.390 --> 04:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
the president brandon just dealt with
 
04:34:11.750 --> 04:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
differential aid but i just heard
 
04:34:13.269 --> 04:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
representatives say just the opposite
 
04:34:15.109 --> 04:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
that's annually evaluated so do either
 
04:34:16.310 --> 04:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
one of you gentlemen know the correct
 
04:34:16.320 --> 04:34:18.070 align:start position:0%
one of you gentlemen know the correct
answer

04:34:18.070 --> 04:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh well we could do that an exact
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
session but i'll let representative
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli give you that response now
 
04:34:26.869 --> 04:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you i i think
 
04:34:26.879 --> 04:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you thank you i i think
you're

04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
correct in that if you look at line
 
04:34:32.150 --> 04:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
seven no income threshold need be met in
 
04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
subsequent years
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
right what is recalculated is the amount
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
of their grant based on adequacy and any
 
04:34:42.070 --> 04:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.310 --> 04:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
yes that's that is so you'd be checking
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
for free and reduced meals
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
and the child may no longer have an iep
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
too so there wouldn't be any eligibility
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
under the special education as well or
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
english language learner
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
do we have any other uh cards for this
 
04:35:14.879 --> 04:35:18.230 align:start position:0%
do we have any other uh cards for this
one

04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
well that's it we'll close the hearing
 
04:35:20.160 --> 04:35:21.510 align:start position:0%
well that's it we'll close the hearing
and

04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
wish representative ham a wonderful trip
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
it was miserable this morning
 
04:35:32.240 --> 04:35:33.590 align:start position:0%
it was miserable this morning
awful

04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
awful
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:47.429 --> 04:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
i do have a question about the question
 
04:35:49.990 --> 04:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
that representative woodcock just asked
 
04:35:51.670 --> 04:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:35:51.680 --> 04:35:52.629 align:start position:0%
about the
income

04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
and eligibility
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
under the
 
04:35:57.750 --> 04:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
efa accounts
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
i'm confused now
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that there would be
 
04:36:02.879 --> 04:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that there would be
no

04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:36:03.840 --> 04:36:05.339 align:start position:0%
no
further

04:36:05.339 --> 04:36:05.349 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:06.709 align:start position:0%
further
[Music]

04:36:06.709 --> 04:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:09.189 --> 04:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
check on the
 
04:36:09.199 --> 04:36:10.150 align:start position:0%
check on the
income

04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
04:36:12.789 --> 04:36:12.799 align:start position:0%
once a family had been accepted into
 
04:36:14.629 --> 04:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
that program
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
they were in the program they didn't
 
04:36:17.510 --> 04:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
have to keep
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
verifying their income year after year
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
but now we just found out that they have
 
04:36:23.990 --> 04:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
to verify their income for free and
 
04:36:25.750 --> 04:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches
 
04:36:25.760 --> 04:36:27.269 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches
so

04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
if if they don't
 
04:36:33.189 --> 04:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
i guess i i want to know how that can be
 
04:36:35.269 --> 04:36:35.279 align:start position:0%
two different things and
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think we in this bill are mixing some
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
apples with oranges
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh eligibility is correct what represent
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
woodcock was saying there now
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
when we talk about adequacy and
 
04:36:51.109 --> 04:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid that's a different
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
topic all together and that will change
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
even the public school for certain
 
04:36:57.429 --> 04:36:57.439 align:start position:0%
students depending upon whether they
 
04:36:59.990 --> 04:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
still require that service yes but if
 
04:37:02.070 --> 04:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
they're looking in order to do that they
 
04:37:04.310 --> 04:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
have to look at someone's income they
 
04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
they send that it's it's a
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
a form which is sent home
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know how that's done yes but they
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
still look at income
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes they do but that's not for
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying to be in to in the program
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
they're already in the program
 
04:37:21.590 --> 04:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
now we're looking at and see if they're
 
04:37:24.629 --> 04:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
still eligible to receive the level of
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
food services so or
 
04:37:30.230 --> 04:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
that stuff right so if a parent sends in
 
04:37:32.551 --> 04:37:32.561 align:start position:0%
their income
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
to verify for a free and reduced lunch
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the income is too high
 
04:37:39.750 --> 04:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
to qualify
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
for an efa account anymore
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how we would not look
 
04:37:46.551 --> 04:37:46.561 align:start position:0%
at that
 
04:37:46.561 --> 04:37:48.150 align:start position:0%
at that
i

04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:37:50.390 --> 04:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
i don't understand how we're looking at
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
income but we're not looking at income
 
04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
and the third or you're not looking at
 
04:37:57.349 --> 04:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility and that's what this is this
 
04:37:59.910 --> 04:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
this category of statute we were looking
 
04:37:59.920 --> 04:38:02.390 align:start position:0%
this category of statute we were looking
at

04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about eligible student
 
04:38:07.910 --> 04:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about eligibility at
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent level right that's what
 
04:38:13.910 --> 04:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we've now injected
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
this other topic in there where i
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
believe if i were writing this statute i
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
would not have put it underneath this
 
04:38:22.830 --> 04:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
particular area of
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
law and that's something we might want
 
04:38:27.109 --> 04:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
04:38:29.349 --> 04:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
when we're considering this in executive
 
04:38:29.359 --> 04:38:33.109 align:start position:0%
when we're considering this in executive
session

04:38:33.109 --> 04:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:35.029 --> 04:38:35.039 align:start position:0%
it's just confusing to me because i have
 
04:38:37.029 --> 04:38:37.039 align:start position:0%
a discussion going on here which we can
 
04:38:38.869 --> 04:38:38.879 align:start position:0%
do because we're not in hearing right
 
04:38:44.230 --> 04:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.390 --> 04:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
once the child is accepted into the
 
04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
program we no longer look at their
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.670 --> 04:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
as being eligible we no longer look at
 
04:38:57.670 --> 04:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
their income to see if they're eligible
 
04:39:00.709 --> 04:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
for the program yes once they do look at
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
their income to see how much money they
 
04:39:03.119 --> 04:39:05.269 align:start position:0%
their income to see how much money they
get

04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
how am i whether they get any additional
 
04:39:09.750 --> 04:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
money or not i understand that i
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
understand that but my question is
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
so someone is eligible for the program
 
04:39:17.910 --> 04:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the first year because they are 300
 
04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
of poverty
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
year two and and that might make them
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunches as
 
04:39:24.240 --> 04:39:26.551 align:start position:0%
eligible for free and reduced lunches as
well

04:39:26.551 --> 04:39:26.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
year two they're at 400 percent of of of
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
free of
 
04:39:35.349 --> 04:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
poverty which
 
04:39:35.359 --> 04:39:36.629 align:start position:0%
poverty which
would

04:39:36.629 --> 04:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:39:38.628 --> 04:39:38.638 align:start position:0%
make them ineligible for free and
 
04:39:40.550 --> 04:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches and also makes them
 
04:39:43.270 --> 04:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
ineligible for the receiving the program
 
04:39:44.708 --> 04:39:44.718 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the income it's the
 
04:39:46.470 --> 04:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
same income
 
04:39:48.470 --> 04:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
because of the way the bill was written
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
it was intentionally written
 
04:39:53.590 --> 04:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
so that once a child was eligible and
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
started in the program they did not have
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be bumped if their parents
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
made more money this was the issue in
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
the i was in the senate hearing just
 
04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
last week yes and heard all of this
 
04:40:05.440 --> 04:40:06.868 align:start position:0%
last week yes and heard all of this
basically

04:40:06.868 --> 04:40:06.878 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
um the whole the whole point was you
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
don't have a kid coming in and out of a
 
04:40:13.670 --> 04:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
program based on how well their parents
 
04:40:16.390 --> 04:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
did that year in income but they do come
 
04:40:17.750 --> 04:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
in and out of the program for free and
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches if the parents that's
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's just me
 
04:40:23.670 --> 04:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
comes in income comes five dollars over
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
the limit then they're out of the free
 
04:40:27.510 --> 04:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch program i mean we do
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
kick kids out of programs when right but
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
you don't kick them out of the school
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the thing if his kid is going
 
04:40:37.510 --> 04:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
to a school and using this
 
04:40:40.390 --> 04:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
or some educational
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
program provider whatever and find
 
04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
something that really works say they're
 
04:40:47.110 --> 04:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
going to the monastery school and this
 
04:40:49.350 --> 04:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
is what's allowing them and now the
 
04:40:50.868 --> 04:40:50.878 align:start position:0%
parents make just a little bit more
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
money we don't kick them out but then
 
04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
the next year they make a little less so
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
now they can go to the montessori school
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
once they're in once they find a program
 
04:41:01.190 --> 04:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
that works they get to stay and that was
 
04:41:04.310 --> 04:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
the whole point of that part of the law
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
what the the checking the
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility is is for the extra money so
 
04:41:12.788 --> 04:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
say they don't need the special needs
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
aid anymore say
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know that those all those built-in
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
things that you know that we calculate
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
04:41:23.190 --> 04:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's they check the income just to see
 
04:41:25.670 --> 04:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
what the calculation is so eligibility
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
like he was saying doesn't make sense to
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
put it here because it's not checking if
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
they're eligible it's checking just to
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
see how much money they get
 
04:41:36.070 --> 04:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:41:39.110 --> 04:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:41.510 --> 04:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
except it's not the way
 
04:41:43.750 --> 04:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
other programs that give government
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
money to people work
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's that's not how it works if you if
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
you earn more money then you are no
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
longer eligible and that happens many
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
times for many programs but uh but the
 
04:41:59.830 --> 04:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
way this works we're talking adequacy
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
there's base base cost which is roughly
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
around thirty seven hundred dollars and
 
04:42:06.628 --> 04:42:06.638 align:start position:0%
then you have the categorical areas not
 
04:42:08.070 --> 04:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
categorical but those areas of
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid those go to every
 
04:42:11.200 --> 04:42:12.230 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid those go to every
student

04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
student
 
04:42:12.240 --> 04:42:13.110 align:start position:0%
student
in

04:42:13.110 --> 04:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
in this state whether it's a wealthy
 
04:42:17.190 --> 04:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
community or a poor community
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
whether the family is wealthy or not
 
04:42:19.680 --> 04:42:20.788 align:start position:0%
whether the family is wealthy or not
they

04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:42:23.430 --> 04:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
they will get this basic adequacy and if
 
04:42:25.350 --> 04:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
they qualify as a special ed student
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
they will get the additional dollar for
 
04:42:29.830 --> 04:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
that and the others too if they qualify
 
04:42:31.590 --> 04:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's just like if they qualify for
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
special ed so if someone comes in to
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
apply for the education freedom account
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
and their income is 400
 
04:42:41.830 --> 04:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
of poverty they don't qualify for the
 
04:42:41.840 --> 04:42:42.948 align:start position:0%
of poverty they don't qualify for the
program

04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:42:44.948 --> 04:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
that's correct first year
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way it is
 
04:42:47.280 --> 04:42:49.350 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way it is
okay

04:42:49.350 --> 04:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:51.510 --> 04:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
so why would then
 
04:42:53.270 --> 04:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
a person who gets
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
300 of poverty the first year 400 of
 
04:42:59.270 --> 04:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
poverty the second year why would that
 
04:42:59.280 --> 04:43:00.708 align:start position:0%
poverty the second year why would that
not

04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:43:02.470 --> 04:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
phase out then
 
04:43:04.230 --> 04:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
if the person has enough money then
 
04:43:06.470 --> 04:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
supposedly to pay for their their
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
tuition to this
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
to this school it might very well phase
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
out some of the differentiated aid for
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
the student that is
 
04:43:15.520 --> 04:43:16.550 align:start position:0%
the student that is
uh

04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
in the free reduced meal program
 
04:43:22.390 --> 04:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
however um there's a lot of other
 
04:43:24.150 --> 04:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
variables that depend upon the income
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
the family can increase but so can the
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
number of kids in the family increase
 
04:43:30.470 --> 04:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
but that would that would change
 
04:43:33.590 --> 04:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
according to the poverty level it's a
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's just it's it's the way it
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
just seems inequitable to me
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
that someone who is earning more than
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
you need to get into the program
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to worry about it anymore
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
they could you know
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
get a
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
becoming at 700 percent of poverty the
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
second year and still be getting state
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
money to send their kids to private
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
school it just
 
04:44:02.470 --> 04:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
seems because all kids get that money
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
all kids regardless no because those
 
04:44:06.070 --> 04:44:06.080 align:start position:0%
kids didn't get that money
 
04:44:07.750 --> 04:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
if they had 400
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
poverty they did not get that money to
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
get into that program originally
 
04:44:15.270 --> 04:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
if you're a student in the
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
rigor program
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
and they have 400 they're at that 400
 
04:44:20.628 --> 04:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
level they're still going to get their
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
adequacy and all their differentiated
 
04:44:26.788 --> 04:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
no i would i would i would agree with
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
you that it's not fair but my solution
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
is since all the kids that go to public
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
school that money gets spent for their
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
education that all the kids that don't
 
04:44:40.628 --> 04:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
go to public school should have that
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
same amount of money and that discon
 
04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
disallowing them at 300 percent is the
 
04:44:49.030 --> 04:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
part that's unfair because
 
04:44:51.270 --> 04:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
most people are trapped in the middle
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
income area where they can't afford
 
04:44:56.230 --> 04:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
anything and they don't get scholarships
 
04:44:56.240 --> 04:44:56.948 align:start position:0%
anything and they don't get scholarships
so

04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:59.750 --> 04:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
the 300 percent is still
 
04:45:01.590 --> 04:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
what ends up happening is people move
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
above that 300 percent now they're
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
considered middle you know they might be
 
04:45:07.910 --> 04:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
low middle income they might just be
 
04:45:10.230 --> 04:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
making a little bit more but now they
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
get nothing and they can't afford
 
04:45:14.070 --> 04:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
private school
 
04:45:15.830 --> 04:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
and that happens with food stamps and
 
04:45:17.830 --> 04:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
that happens with with
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
help paying for child care and all those
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
other programs that people
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
have that issue in i agree and i think
 
04:45:42.628 --> 04:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and that is uh hb 1241

for the representative

yes representative waltz
 
04:47:33.750 --> 04:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
so i keep hearing this term natural
 
04:47:38.390 --> 04:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
immunity thrown around in here and i
 
04:47:40.550 --> 04:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
don't understand what it is because i
 
04:47:41.910 --> 04:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
look at for example representative
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
oliver who would ordinarily be here he's
 
04:47:43.920 --> 04:47:45.190 align:start position:0%
oliver who would ordinarily be here he's
been

04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
04:47:47.510 --> 04:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
boosted he's head covered once and he's
 
04:47:48.868 --> 04:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
got covert again
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
so he obviously doesn't have a natural
 
04:47:52.150 --> 04:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
immunity to cover because he's gotten it
 
04:47:53.910 --> 04:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
twice i'm trying to understand what
 
04:47:56.550 --> 04:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
natural immunity means
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.320 --> 04:48:01.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:48:03.270 --> 04:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
as a first responder
 
04:48:05.910 --> 04:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
um we've been in this
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
particular pandemic from the start
 
04:48:11.510 --> 04:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and what some of the uh
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
experience that came from that
 
04:48:13.600 --> 04:48:15.430 align:start position:0%
experience that came from that
not

04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:48:17.670 --> 04:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
as i've seen many different uh different
 
04:48:17.680 --> 04:48:18.868 align:start position:0%
as i've seen many different uh different
patients

04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:48:21.110 --> 04:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i've seen the likes of the
 
04:48:24.230 --> 04:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and not vaccinated but i'd
 
04:48:25.510 --> 04:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
like to
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
really hone in on that this isn't really
 
04:48:28.320 --> 04:48:29.190 align:start position:0%
really hone in on that this isn't really
about

04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
being anti-vaxxed
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the the mandate
 
04:48:37.030 --> 04:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
but the conversation has to involve
 
04:48:37.040 --> 04:48:38.948 align:start position:0%
but the conversation has to involve
vaccinations

04:48:38.948 --> 04:48:38.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
so and to clarify i believe that you
 
04:48:49.110 --> 04:48:49.120 align:start position:0%
the common cold for example
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
some folks can deal with it better than
 
04:48:51.840 --> 04:48:52.788 align:start position:0%
some folks can deal with it better than
others

04:48:52.788 --> 04:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
others
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
there are need for medical interventions
 
04:48:57.110 --> 04:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
for some people
 
04:48:58.628 --> 04:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
but not all
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
and through my personal experience i
 
04:49:02.390 --> 04:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
have seen that
 
04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
but i can also follow up with some more
 
04:49:05.120 --> 04:49:07.270 align:start position:0%
but i can also follow up with some more
information

04:49:07.270 --> 04:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:49:09.670 --> 04:49:09.680 align:start position:0%

some

04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
locations do require
 
04:50:07.910 --> 04:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
um i'd rather not divulge
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
my personal medical information for that
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
for this conversation though i can't say
 
04:50:15.430 --> 04:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
that we do know of locations departments
 
04:50:19.270 --> 04:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
agencies that do require it yes
 
04:50:19.280 --> 04:50:20.310 align:start position:0%
agencies that do require it yes
yes

04:50:31.110 --> 04:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
if you'd like i could follow up with the
 
04:50:33.830 --> 04:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
specifics of those
 
04:50:35.990 --> 04:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
and and what would be required at least
 
04:50:41.030 --> 04:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
further questions

represent porter
 
04:50:47.030 --> 04:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair and thank you for taking
 
04:50:48.390 --> 04:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
my question i think i'm going to follow
 
04:50:50.948 --> 04:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
up a little bit on representative walt
 
04:50:52.230 --> 04:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
would natural natural immunity prevent
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
me from getting
 
04:50:56.320 --> 04:51:00.708 align:start position:0%
me from getting
hiv

04:51:00.708 --> 04:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:02.470 --> 04:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:51:05.510 --> 04:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
i believe the two are very different
 
04:51:05.520 --> 04:51:06.628 align:start position:0%
i believe the two are very different
um

04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:06.638 --> 04:51:07.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:51:07.910 --> 04:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:09.750 --> 04:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
you would have to
 
04:51:13.110 --> 04:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
have a little more data on the uh
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
well on the person also i'm not certain
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
of any people that have
 
04:51:22.470 --> 04:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
been exposed to it and somehow
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:28.628 --> 04:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:51:30.708 --> 04:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
04:51:32.230 --> 04:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:51:34.150 --> 04:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
representative lancer for taking my
 
04:51:34.160 --> 04:51:35.110 align:start position:0%
representative lancer for taking my
question

04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:51:38.310 --> 04:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
um if i'm not mistaken uh i think i read
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the union leader this morning
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the new hampshire department of
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
public health has said that they have no
 
04:51:50.310 --> 04:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
intention of seeking a covet 19 mandate
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
did you happen to
 
04:51:54.310 --> 04:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
read that information or do you have any
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
information about that
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
i did not know of that article or
 
04:52:04.070 --> 04:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
information just prior to this meeting i
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
was notified of
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
some of the states
 
04:52:09.910 --> 04:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
i believe you'll hear that very soon
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
their take on the mandates in general
 
04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
if that helps
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:52:20.948 --> 04:52:20.958 align:start position:0%

i i
 
04:52:45.990 --> 04:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
could address the previous questions if
 
04:52:48.550 --> 04:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
you would like or not
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
well maybe in your presentation you
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
could allude to it i will allude to it
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
i heavily heavily support this bill for
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh prohibiting vaccination
 
04:53:01.200 --> 04:53:02.470 align:start position:0%
uh prohibiting vaccination
for

04:53:02.470 --> 04:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:53:06.628 --> 04:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
superintendent for school districts
 
04:53:09.990 --> 04:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:10.000 --> 04:53:11.350 align:start position:0%
 
healthy

04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
healthy
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
students of kindergarten through college
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
04:53:18.628 --> 04:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
and across the country have much milder
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
symptoms to the variants of coba that
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've been exposed to so far
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
and now that we have omicron we have a
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
very mild
 
04:53:28.160 --> 04:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
very mild
virus

04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
virus
 
04:53:29.600 --> 04:53:31.030 align:start position:0%
virus
and

04:53:31.030 --> 04:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:31.040 --> 04:53:32.708 align:start position:0%
and
people

04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
adults through kids are suffering much
 
04:53:39.110 --> 04:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
less than the previous variants
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
we should compare this as a
 
04:53:45.430 --> 04:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
typical seasonal flu as far as symptoms
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
are go go this is the way that children
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
will handle these sort of things
 
04:53:53.350 --> 04:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't see that we need to
 
04:53:55.030 --> 04:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
add special
 
04:53:56.788 --> 04:53:56.798 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
a second
 
04:54:04.550 --> 04:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
reason why we we should
 
04:54:04.560 --> 04:54:06.070 align:start position:0%
reason why we we should
support

04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
is that the risk ratio
 
04:54:10.958 --> 04:54:12.628 align:start position:0%
is that the risk ratio
for

04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:54:12.638 --> 04:54:14.788 align:start position:0%
for
children

04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
children
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
and covid
 
04:54:19.510 --> 04:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
and especially omicron at this point
 
04:54:19.520 --> 04:54:19.910 align:start position:0%
and especially omicron at this point
um

04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:19.920 --> 04:54:21.190 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

04:54:21.190 --> 04:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
it does not support an argument
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
for any kind of mandate
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
and i would refer to
 
04:54:31.830 --> 04:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
the so-called holy grail of medical
 
04:54:35.910 --> 04:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
ethics the nuremberg code
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
number four tenet of the code of ten
 
04:54:42.070 --> 04:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
four of ten specifically states
 
04:54:44.550 --> 04:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
the degree of risk to be taken should
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
never exceed that determined by the
 
04:54:51.430 --> 04:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
humanitarian importance of the problem
 
04:54:56.230 --> 04:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:00.550 --> 04:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to have children
 
04:55:00.560 --> 04:55:02.948 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to have children
vaccinated

04:55:02.948 --> 04:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
04:55:05.270 --> 04:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
there was a bill yesterday that included
 
04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
college kids and again
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
college age
 
04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
young adults are
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
well adapted to handle the
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
exposure to covid and do very well
 
04:55:22.868 --> 04:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
but there are some side effects
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
listed that we know are apparent uh for
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
for some of the vaccines including uh
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
myocarditis probably being the
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
number one
 
04:55:33.920 --> 04:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
number one
adverse

04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
adverse
 
04:55:37.590 --> 04:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
effect that's reported
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
and again you're talking about
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
inflammation of the heart and injury to
 
04:55:42.628 --> 04:55:42.638 align:start position:0%
the heart where
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
the heart is not able to
 
04:55:47.030 --> 04:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
repair itself
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
it has only so many cells to deal with
 
04:55:51.110 --> 04:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
and if you
 
04:55:51.120 --> 04:55:53.430 align:start position:0%
and if you
expose

04:55:53.430 --> 04:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
expose
 
04:55:56.390 --> 04:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
or if you contact a disease of the of
 
04:55:59.430 --> 04:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
the heart as a young person you'll carry
 
04:56:04.708 --> 04:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:06.470 --> 04:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
another point i'd like to make about
 
04:56:06.480 --> 04:56:08.390 align:start position:0%
another point i'd like to make about
this

04:56:08.390 --> 04:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:56:08.400 --> 04:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
this
the

04:56:08.640 --> 04:56:08.650 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:08.650 --> 04:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

04:56:09.830 --> 04:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
covet vaccines have been shown to be
 
04:56:15.430 --> 04:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
fairly ineffective for a long-term
 
04:56:15.440 --> 04:56:18.708 align:start position:0%
fairly ineffective for a long-term
durable

04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.718 --> 04:56:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
symptom

04:56:19.910 --> 04:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
symptom
 
04:56:19.920 --> 04:56:20.868 align:start position:0%
symptom
or

04:56:20.868 --> 04:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
i should say it was designed to
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
lessen symptoms it was not designed to
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
prevent spread from
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
person to person and as one of the
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
representatives noted
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
she knew of someone who was multiply
 
04:56:39.990 --> 04:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
vaccinated boostered and had covered
 
04:56:43.350 --> 04:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
once twice etc so
 
04:56:45.830 --> 04:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
um they're not as effective as we as we
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:52.320 --> 04:56:54.390 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:56:55.600 --> 04:56:56.550 align:start position:0%
the the
last

04:56:56.550 --> 04:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
most important point i'd like to share
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i think it's good news uh good news
 
04:57:08.230 --> 04:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the children and that is i've come
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
across some data from the cdc that
 
04:57:13.110 --> 04:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:57:15.270 --> 04:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring antibodies in
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
children in the 5 to 11 age group
 
04:57:21.910 --> 04:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
and this was
 
04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
determined from blood samples from all
 
04:57:25.830 --> 04:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
across the country in from different
 
04:57:25.840 --> 04:57:27.670 align:start position:0%
across the country in from different
laboratories

04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
laboratories
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the data indicated that in november
 
04:57:30.320 --> 04:57:31.510 align:start position:0%
and the data indicated that in november
december

04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
december
 
04:57:31.520 --> 04:57:33.990 align:start position:0%
december
2020

04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
2020
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the 5 to 11 year old age group
 
04:57:37.760 --> 04:57:39.270 align:start position:0%
in the 5 to 11 year old age group
18

04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
18
 
04:57:41.830 --> 04:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
of that population had
 
04:57:44.070 --> 04:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
natural antibodies
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
now these are people that have not been
 
04:57:49.430 --> 04:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated injected
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
they are
 
04:57:52.550 --> 04:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
so-called naive
 
04:57:55.590 --> 04:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
in that they've had exposure to
 
04:57:55.600 --> 04:57:57.190 align:start position:0%
in that they've had exposure to
covid

04:57:57.190 --> 04:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
covid
 
04:57:57.200 --> 04:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
covid
and

04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:01.030 --> 04:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
as children may not
 
04:58:03.590 --> 04:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
have even been symptomatic
 
04:58:03.600 --> 04:58:04.390 align:start position:0%
have even been symptomatic
but

04:58:04.390 --> 04:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:58:04.400 --> 04:58:05.350 align:start position:0%
but
18

04:58:05.350 --> 04:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
18
 
04:58:08.070 --> 04:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
of that population had
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
natural antibodies
 
04:58:11.120 --> 04:58:13.830 align:start position:0%
natural antibodies
to

04:58:13.830 --> 04:58:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
04:58:15.520 --> 04:58:16.868 align:start position:0%
in other words
they

04:58:16.868 --> 04:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:58:19.590 --> 04:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh likely inhaled a
 
04:58:21.750 --> 04:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
in this case a virus
 
04:58:23.830 --> 04:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
their body
 
04:58:23.840 --> 04:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
their body
uh

04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
all the defense mechanisms of the body
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
the b cells the t cells
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
all the other
 
04:58:31.200 --> 04:58:32.470 align:start position:0%
all the other
defenders

04:58:32.470 --> 04:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
defenders
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
found this
 
04:58:34.000 --> 04:58:35.430 align:start position:0%
found this
virus

04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
virus
 
04:58:35.440 --> 04:58:37.110 align:start position:0%
virus
and

04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
went to work on preventing the
 
04:58:41.590 --> 04:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
replication of the virus by producing
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
antibodies these are their own
 
04:58:42.958 --> 04:58:46.150 align:start position:0%
antibodies these are their own
antibodies

04:58:46.150 --> 04:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:48.150 --> 04:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's what is meant by
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
and i and i i don't want to spend time
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:58:58.628 --> 04:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
mrna vaccines
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's a bit more complicated
 
04:59:00.878 --> 04:59:02.550 align:start position:0%
it's a bit more complicated
but

04:59:02.550 --> 04:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it perhaps later but
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
the good news was 18 percent that was
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
november december 2020
 
04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
six months later
 
04:59:13.350 --> 04:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
they did the similar study
 
04:59:15.110 --> 04:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
number of the percent of
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
children in the 5 to 11 age group
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
the percent that had natural
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
covert antibodies
 
04:59:25.280 --> 04:59:26.150 align:start position:0%
covert antibodies
was

04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:59:26.160 --> 04:59:29.110 align:start position:0%
was
42

04:59:29.110 --> 04:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
naturally occurring antibodies already
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
fast forward to today which is maybe
 
04:59:36.788 --> 04:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
eight months later
 
04:59:39.990 --> 04:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i think it's safe to assume that
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
the number of antibodies is well over 50
 
04:59:45.430 --> 04:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
in that population given the
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
the spread of covid
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the good news
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
and i would like to just talk about a
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
minute about flu vaccines that we have a
 
04:59:59.110 --> 04:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
yearly flu vaccine that we
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
may or may not take
 
05:00:00.878 --> 05:00:02.550 align:start position:0%
may or may not take
but

05:00:02.550 --> 05:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
experts in the medical field try to
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
anticipate and determine
 
05:00:09.830 --> 05:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
which strain of the
 
05:00:12.550 --> 05:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
influenza a influenza b influenza
 
05:00:15.110 --> 05:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
whatever kovat whatever is going to be
 
05:00:17.830 --> 05:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
coming next season
 
05:00:17.840 --> 05:00:19.270 align:start position:0%
coming next season
and

05:00:19.270 --> 05:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:00:22.310 --> 05:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
it's an estimate and it's not very good
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of these vaccines that we
 
05:00:26.628 --> 05:00:26.638 align:start position:0%
take for the flu
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
are less than 50 percent
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
so if we consider omicron
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
a mild flu-like illness
 
05:00:35.120 --> 05:00:36.230 align:start position:0%
a mild flu-like illness
already

05:00:36.230 --> 05:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:00:37.830 --> 05:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
the children
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
are well
 
05:00:43.190 --> 05:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
protected more so than any vaccine for a
 
05:00:47.510 --> 05:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
so i would just say uh for this bill i
 
05:00:51.590 --> 05:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
05:00:53.910 --> 05:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
we don't need more mandates especially
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
for our children
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh for the safety of our children i
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
think the thing that to do is just to
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
leave them alone
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
take off their masks let them congregate
 
05:01:07.190 --> 05:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
forget the shutdowns
 
05:01:09.270 --> 05:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
leave them alone
 
05:01:09.280 --> 05:01:10.150 align:start position:0%
leave them alone
and

05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:12.550 --> 05:01:12.560 align:start position:0%
let parents make decisions about any
 
05:01:13.990 --> 05:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines that

porter
 
05:01:27.750 --> 05:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:01:29.670 --> 05:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
doctor i didn't hear you when you
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
introduced yourself and told us where
 
05:01:33.590 --> 05:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
you were from oh i'm sorry hopkinson new
 
05:01:36.230 --> 05:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay thank you and
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
are people dying from omicron
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's very rare to find
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
any evidence of this being a
 
05:01:44.638 --> 05:01:46.390 align:start position:0%
any evidence of this being a
dangerous

05:01:46.390 --> 05:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
thing about children and adults i'm
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
talking about why are the hospitals
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
having deaths then if omicron is not
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:56.480 --> 05:01:57.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:01:57.350 --> 05:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have the data for that typically
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
the people that are hospitalized have uh
 
05:02:05.030 --> 05:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
what's called co-morbidities they have
 
05:02:05.040 --> 05:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
what's called co-morbidities they have
underlying

05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
05:02:08.708 --> 05:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
conditions that would predispose them to
 
05:02:08.718 --> 05:02:09.670 align:start position:0%
conditions that would predispose them to
be

05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:02:09.680 --> 05:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
be
sick

05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
sick
 
05:02:11.440 --> 05:02:12.628 align:start position:0%
sick
but

05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:02:14.230 --> 05:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
healthy chill for the most part healthy
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
children and the most of our school
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
children are healthy
 
05:02:19.270 --> 05:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
are going to do
 
05:02:20.708 --> 05:02:20.718 align:start position:0%
uh well if they
 
05:02:23.830 --> 05:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.270 --> 05:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia do you have a
 
05:02:25.280 --> 05:02:26.550 align:start position:0%
represent cordelia do you have a
question

05:02:26.550 --> 05:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
we don't have any i don't think we have
 
05:02:28.160 --> 05:02:29.110 align:start position:0%
we don't have any i don't think we have
any

05:02:29.110 --> 05:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:02:30.788 --> 05:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm just recalling testimony from
 
05:02:33.870 --> 05:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday from someone who looks at
 
05:02:33.880 --> 05:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
yesterday from someone who looks at
[Music]

05:02:35.510 --> 05:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:02:35.520 --> 05:02:36.628 align:start position:0%
[Music]
vaccine

05:02:36.628 --> 05:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:02:36.638 --> 05:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
vaccine
information

05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
and again this is not my testimony but
 
05:02:42.868 --> 05:02:42.878 align:start position:0%
she held up um
 
05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
a placard that showed how many people
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
have died how many children have died
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
from covid and that was a zero
 
05:02:49.680 --> 05:02:51.350 align:start position:0%
from covid and that was a zero
and

05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:55.510 --> 05:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's i i won't say any more about that
 
05:02:57.270 --> 05:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
05:02:59.190 --> 05:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
doctor for being here
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
do you know if any of the vaccines
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
have received
 
05:03:08.550 --> 05:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm talking about use for children
 
05:03:11.350 --> 05:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
have received fda approval beyond
 
05:03:13.670 --> 05:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency use
 
05:03:18.070 --> 05:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
05:03:21.590 --> 05:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:03:21.600 --> 05:03:22.628 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:03:22.638 --> 05:03:24.310 align:start position:0%
question
um

05:03:24.310 --> 05:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
i actually have two parts this question
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
the first one is
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
do children who have that are infected
 
05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
with covid
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
not from the vaccine but from the
 
05:03:34.560 --> 05:03:35.670 align:start position:0%
not from the vaccine but from the
infection

05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
infection
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
it is known i do not know
 
05:03:49.510 --> 05:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
05:03:53.350 --> 05:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
but i won't say for sure okay well my
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that it's
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
found more in
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
children who have coveted infections
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
than it is in
 
05:04:08.868 --> 05:04:08.878 align:start position:0%
children who have myocarditis from the
 
05:04:11.670 --> 05:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine so
 
05:04:13.350 --> 05:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that you're saying that
 
05:04:16.310 --> 05:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
the myocarditis occurs more frequently
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
in the covet infections infection it may
 
05:04:21.430 --> 05:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
it may
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh doctor i have a question uh we have a
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
number of vaccines
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that are required for entry into school
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
public schools right
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are certain exceptions why should
 
05:04:36.000 --> 05:04:36.788 align:start position:0%
there are certain exceptions why should
this

05:04:36.788 --> 05:04:36.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:36.798 --> 05:04:38.550 align:start position:0%
this
vaccine

05:04:38.550 --> 05:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
be placed amongst the requirements like
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
polio or why should it not be placed in
 
05:04:47.750 --> 05:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
to that category of a required shot
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
well i think the risk
 
05:04:50.080 --> 05:04:51.510 align:start position:0%
well i think the risk
to

05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:04:54.150 --> 05:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
the population the patient population in
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
this case is children
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
05:04:57.840 --> 05:04:58.550 align:start position:0%
the risk
is

05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:05:01.590 --> 05:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
less than the risk of side effects from
 
05:05:05.350 --> 05:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
05:05:10.948 --> 05:05:10.958 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that thank you
 
05:05:12.628 --> 05:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor for taking my question
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
could you elaborate on that a little bit
 
05:05:19.910 --> 05:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i understand um
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
i definitely remember being five years
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
old and standing in line for my polio
 
05:05:28.708 --> 05:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine so uh
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think representative ladd's question
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
if we could sort of
 
05:05:37.830 --> 05:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
ferret out a deeper answer to that
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
of the vaccines that are currently
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:47.990 --> 05:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
what would make it okay for us to
 
05:05:50.230 --> 05:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
require those
 
05:05:50.240 --> 05:05:51.190 align:start position:0%
require those
and

05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
why would we or would we not put covid
 
05:06:03.670 --> 05:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.868 --> 05:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
well i guess i again i spoke to the
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
the resemblance to a flu-like illness i
 
05:06:12.550 --> 05:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
mean i i would we
 
05:06:14.070 --> 05:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
should we
 
05:06:14.080 --> 05:06:15.350 align:start position:0%
should we
include

05:06:15.350 --> 05:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:06:17.670 --> 05:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
annual flu vaccines for children i guess
 
05:06:17.680 --> 05:06:18.550 align:start position:0%
annual flu vaccines for children i guess
that's

05:06:18.550 --> 05:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:06:20.788 --> 05:06:20.798 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at it as that it would be
 
05:06:22.948 --> 05:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
similar to that
 
05:06:24.550 --> 05:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
symptoms and
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
uh symptoms of covet and
 
05:06:26.638 --> 05:06:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh symptoms of covet and
or

05:06:27.350 --> 05:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
symptoms of coed you know i'm saying
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
omicron with our current uh variant are
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
similar to a seasonal flu so
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's reasonable to expect
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
that kids would get a reason a
 
05:06:46.150 --> 05:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
so may i follow up to where
 
05:06:50.788 --> 05:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
representative and i are asking similar
 
05:06:53.910 --> 05:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions so a polio vaccine
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
is the polio vaccine that i got
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
back in the
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
i hate to say it 1950s
 
05:07:04.868 --> 05:07:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh the same now as it was then
 
05:07:07.430 --> 05:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
and would a
 
05:07:10.070 --> 05:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine
 
05:07:12.550 --> 05:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
given today
 
05:07:14.948 --> 05:07:14.958 align:start position:0%
be the same i don't want to say the same
 
05:07:17.430 --> 05:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
number of years but many many many years
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
from now
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
so is is there a
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
a relationship between why
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
we do have polio shots
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then why it may not be wise to have
 
05:07:31.830 --> 05:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
something such as we're talking about i
 
05:07:34.310 --> 05:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
think i think i understand your question
 
05:07:36.470 --> 05:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
polio is polio and
 
05:07:36.480 --> 05:07:37.750 align:start position:0%
polio is polio and
covid

05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
covid
 
05:07:42.230 --> 05:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
deals with mutations of the virus and so
 
05:07:45.190 --> 05:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
now scientists are trying to determine
 
05:07:47.750 --> 05:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
should we have an omicron specific
 
05:07:49.910 --> 05:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine for the current
 
05:07:49.920 --> 05:07:51.430 align:start position:0%
vaccine for the current
trend

05:07:51.430 --> 05:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
trend
 
05:07:54.230 --> 05:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
and they've developed
 
05:07:54.240 --> 05:07:56.788 align:start position:0%
and they've developed
a

05:07:56.788 --> 05:07:56.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
omicron specific vaccine
 
05:07:59.360 --> 05:08:00.628 align:start position:0%
omicron specific vaccine
that

05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
may or may not work as well as the
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine that we originally had
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
there are some studies in primates that
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that the omicron specific
 
05:08:12.788 --> 05:08:12.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine developed for omicron
 
05:08:12.798 --> 05:08:14.628 align:start position:0%
vaccine developed for omicron
performs

05:08:14.628 --> 05:08:14.638 align:start position:0%
performs
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
less less effectively than the original
 
05:08:21.430 --> 05:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
eua vaccine
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
so i think you're going to be looking at
 
05:08:23.520 --> 05:08:24.470 align:start position:0%
so i think you're going to be looking at
a

05:08:24.470 --> 05:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:08:24.480 --> 05:08:25.990 align:start position:0%
a
yearly

05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
yearly
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
yearly vaccination schedule for our kids
 
05:08:29.990 --> 05:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
if that's something that would be
 
05:08:31.910 --> 05:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
approved for something like covet just
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
as we would for influenza it's a
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
different recipe i think that answers my
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you uh representative
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
walton and representative ellison
 
05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
doctor isn't it true that many vaccines
 
05:08:46.628 --> 05:08:46.638 align:start position:0%
are given not just to protect the person
 
05:08:48.868 --> 05:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
receiving the vaccine but to protect the
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
population that they come in touch with
 
05:08:52.628 --> 05:08:52.638 align:start position:0%
that may be vulnerable and can't be
 
05:08:52.638 --> 05:08:54.628 align:start position:0%
that may be vulnerable and can't be
vaccinated

05:08:54.628 --> 05:08:54.638 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
that argument has been used
 
05:09:00.708 --> 05:09:00.718 align:start position:0%
a lot especially for the current
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
situation but my understanding that a
 
05:09:03.200 --> 05:09:04.708 align:start position:0%
situation but my understanding that a
vaccine

05:09:04.708 --> 05:09:04.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
is taken to protect the individual
 
05:09:10.310 --> 05:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
and if we take the example of
 
05:09:12.868 --> 05:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
well little john little johnny and
 
05:09:15.590 --> 05:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
little susie have to get a vaccine for
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
grammy and grandpa
 
05:09:17.360 --> 05:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
grammy and grandpa
um

05:09:18.550 --> 05:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
not really graham and grandpa need to
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
get a vaccine if they think it works
 
05:09:25.590 --> 05:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way i see it
 
05:09:27.990 --> 05:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
um have you seen the data that suggests
 
05:09:29.830 --> 05:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
for example that grandparents get
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated again against whooping cough
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
to protect their newborn grandchildren
 
05:09:36.390 --> 05:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
that again that's one generation being
 
05:09:38.230 --> 05:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to protect another generation
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
have you seen that in your medical work
 
05:09:42.310 --> 05:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i i
 
05:09:44.470 --> 05:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
i would just say that
 
05:09:47.750 --> 05:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
as a physician my specialty is i'm not a
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
clinician i'm a pathologist
 
05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
i worked
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
as a medical director for a laboratory
 
05:09:57.670 --> 05:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
hospital laboratory so um and i can't
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
really i've heard of that i have heard
 
05:10:02.230 --> 05:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
of that especially for
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.868 --> 05:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:10.788 --> 05:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
some people in my age who have
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
grandchildren who's whose parents are
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
insisting that they get
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
some such
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine that you're referring to
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
one more question sure um so
 
05:10:24.070 --> 05:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i heard you
 
05:10:26.310 --> 05:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
correctly i thought i heard you say that
 
05:10:27.670 --> 05:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
in the vast majority of cases
 
05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
myocarditis causes permanent heart
 
05:10:32.230 --> 05:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
damage yet everything i've read and even
 
05:10:34.150 --> 05:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
looking up here suggests quite the
 
05:10:35.590 --> 05:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
opposite that the vast majority of the
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
cases of myocarditis resolve themselves
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
with no long-term damage and it's really
 
05:10:42.310 --> 05:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
only a small number of myocarditis cases
 
05:10:44.708 --> 05:10:44.718 align:start position:0%
that actually cause any long-term damage
 
05:10:47.990 --> 05:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
did i misunderstand what you were saying
 
05:10:49.590 --> 05:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
if you're repeating what i said and i
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
still believe that it does cause
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
long-term damage and it increases the um
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
the lifespan of
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
people who have myocarditis they have a
 
05:11:02.830 --> 05:11:02.840 align:start position:0%
shortened lifespan on
 
05:11:02.840 --> 05:11:04.550 align:start position:0%
shortened lifespan on
average

05:11:04.550 --> 05:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
average
 
05:11:06.150 --> 05:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative ellison
 
05:11:07.830 --> 05:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you doctor for
 
05:11:09.190 --> 05:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh i i think at this point we're down to
 
05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
about eight deaths a day
 
05:11:15.670 --> 05:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of covet in the state and
 
05:11:18.550 --> 05:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
that's dropping as it should
 
05:11:20.868 --> 05:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
do you have a number for how many people
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
a day are dying from the flu in new
 
05:11:22.718 --> 05:11:24.948 align:start position:0%
a day are dying from the flu in new
hampshire

05:11:24.948 --> 05:11:24.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:11:26.948 --> 05:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:11:29.590 --> 05:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter then
 
05:11:31.110 --> 05:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative whitcock
 
05:11:34.070 --> 05:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so um
 
05:11:36.550 --> 05:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you again doctor for for
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
indulging me
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
so if i am a child that can't get
 
05:11:40.798 --> 05:11:42.150 align:start position:0%
so if i am a child that can't get
vaccinated

05:11:42.150 --> 05:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
05:11:45.510 --> 05:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm fragile for one reason or another
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
05:11:49.270 --> 05:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
and i would need to be protected
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
because those around me were vaccinated
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a way that would protect
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
me i'm not the grandmother i'm another
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
kid in your class that's got cancer or
 
05:12:00.550 --> 05:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
whatever can't get the vaccine wouldn't
 
05:12:04.550 --> 05:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
that be a reason why we might want to
 
05:12:06.948 --> 05:12:06.958 align:start position:0%
vaccinate children so that they can the
 
05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
other the child that can't receive a
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
vaccine is protected
 
05:12:14.310 --> 05:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
it might be a reasonable theoretical
 
05:12:16.150 --> 05:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
reason to do it but
 
05:12:18.948 --> 05:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
we've all seen that the vaccines are not
 
05:12:21.110 --> 05:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
as effective as they
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:27.750 --> 05:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
represented woodcock thank you chairman
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.150 --> 05:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
don't feel bad you're not the first one
 
05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
today thank you um
 
05:12:38.708 --> 05:12:38.718 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you taking my question the
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
representative to introduce the bill
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
i i think i quote him correctly said the
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
conversation is really not about
 
05:12:46.868 --> 05:12:46.878 align:start position:0%
anti-facts it's about mandates but this
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
facts of the mandate
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
um and as you went through your
 
05:12:54.070 --> 05:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
testimony you indicated that um
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
you use the same word you said your
 
05:12:57.910 --> 05:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
concern was this shouldn't be mandated
 
05:12:59.830 --> 05:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
it should be left to the parent
 
05:12:59.840 --> 05:13:01.910 align:start position:0%
it should be left to the parent
um

05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:04.070 --> 05:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
during the last multiple months way too
 
05:13:05.110 --> 05:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
many months
 
05:13:07.590 --> 05:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
we've heard from the governor and from
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
dr chen and particularly the governor
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
saying all this should be local it
 
05:13:13.270 --> 05:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
should be the local districts local
 
05:13:13.280 --> 05:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
should be the local districts local
schools

05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:13:15.910 --> 05:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
and all these mayonnaise vaccinations
 
05:13:17.670 --> 05:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
because every district is differently
 
05:13:19.510 --> 05:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's different uh and the demographics
 
05:13:20.310 --> 05:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:13:23.030 --> 05:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
you understand that so my my concern is
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
then if in fact we put this law in place
 
05:13:29.670 --> 05:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
heavenway perhaps restricted to look at
 
05:13:31.110 --> 05:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
the local districts or local school
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
areas of see from
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
responding and and two
 
05:13:37.030 --> 05:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
um haven't we just done what we didn't
 
05:13:38.948 --> 05:13:38.958 align:start position:0%
want to do which is put out a mandate
 
05:13:42.708 --> 05:13:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman yes thank you for the
 
05:13:50.708 --> 05:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
this bill actually prohibits prohibits a
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
mandate so um
 
05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
parents still have the right to have
 
05:13:59.670 --> 05:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
their children vaccinated
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
for this particular bill in question so
 
05:14:04.868 --> 05:14:04.878 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would interfere with
 
05:14:06.868 --> 05:14:06.878 align:start position:0%
that i think parents
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
i feel should be involved in that
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:14.868 --> 05:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
05:14:14.878 --> 05:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
um

05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:17.670 --> 05:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine thank you chairmanline
 
05:14:19.670 --> 05:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
you're welcome uh represent cordelie
 
05:14:21.750 --> 05:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
i've read recently that
 
05:14:26.868 --> 05:14:26.878 align:start position:0%
one of the vaccine companies i believe
 
05:14:31.670 --> 05:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is is testing the vaccine on children
 
05:14:35.430 --> 05:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
age five and lower even to six-month-old
 
05:14:35.440 --> 05:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
age five and lower even to six-month-old
babies

05:14:36.550 --> 05:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
babies
 
05:14:38.788 --> 05:14:38.798 align:start position:0%
do you have any thoughts on giving one
 
05:14:42.470 --> 05:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
of these vaccines to a a one-year-old or
 
05:14:42.480 --> 05:14:44.550 align:start position:0%
of these vaccines to a a one-year-old or
younger

05:14:44.550 --> 05:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
younger
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
it scares me
 
05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
especially with the type of
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine technology that's being used
 
05:14:51.520 --> 05:14:53.830 align:start position:0%
vaccine technology that's being used
today

05:14:53.830 --> 05:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't i wouldn't
 
05:14:58.628 --> 05:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
approve it for my children if they were
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
of age to be getting that now or my
 
05:15:01.040 --> 05:15:04.390 align:start position:0%
of age to be getting that now or my
grandchildren

05:15:04.390 --> 05:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:05.750 --> 05:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
 
05:15:05.760 --> 05:15:07.910 align:start position:0%
are there further questions yes
representation

05:15:07.910 --> 05:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
representation
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr mcfair thank you for
 
05:15:11.270 --> 05:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
taking the question would you say that
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
um because we had such short amount of
 
05:15:13.600 --> 05:15:14.628 align:start position:0%
um because we had such short amount of
time

05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:15:17.830 --> 05:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
at this these vaccines have been out
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we're actually maybe experimenting
 
05:15:23.430 --> 05:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
on our kids by giving them this vaccine
 
05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
i would definitely say so i think the uh
 
05:15:30.390 --> 05:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
the rollout of these vaccines came up
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
very fast we were originally told that
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
it would be a couple years
 
05:15:35.520 --> 05:15:37.590 align:start position:0%
it would be a couple years
and

05:15:37.590 --> 05:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
the original message was that we have no
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
treatment for this
 
05:15:43.040 --> 05:15:44.628 align:start position:0%
treatment for this
but

05:15:44.628 --> 05:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:15:47.830 --> 05:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
i'll throw i'll throw you a bone of hope
 
05:15:50.550 --> 05:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
and say a vaccine and a vaccine is the
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
only way to get you out of this mess
 
05:15:55.510 --> 05:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
and we all held on to that we we had a
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
lot of fear at the beginning all of us
 
05:16:00.708 --> 05:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
including myself including me
 
05:16:02.150 --> 05:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
had a lot of fear
 
05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
it was unfounded
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:06.798 --> 05:16:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
but

05:16:08.150 --> 05:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
the vaccines surprisingly came out in
 
05:16:12.868 --> 05:16:12.878 align:start position:0%
about a year i think it was
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
and people were lining up left and right
 
05:16:19.350 --> 05:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah there's a lot of safety data out
 
05:16:25.350 --> 05:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not as good as we had
 
05:16:29.910 --> 05:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
hoped but we have the vares system which
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
is the vaccine adverse
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
effect reporting system
 
05:16:35.750 --> 05:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
thought to be
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
very underreported
 
05:16:40.400 --> 05:16:41.750 align:start position:0%
very underreported
and

05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
breaking news hopefully soon will be
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
evidence from the department of defense
 
05:16:48.550 --> 05:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
some whistleblowers have found some very
 
05:16:51.040 --> 05:16:53.590 align:start position:0%
some whistleblowers have found some very
damning

05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
damning
 
05:16:55.110 --> 05:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccine injuries in this group of
 
05:17:01.030 --> 05:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
people that is healthy young adults
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
has shown marked increase in
 
05:17:06.628 --> 05:17:06.638 align:start position:0%
side effects over
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
the past five-year period before covid
 
05:17:11.750 --> 05:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh we'll wait for that study to come out
 
05:17:11.760 --> 05:17:12.708 align:start position:0%
uh we'll wait for that study to come out
and

05:17:12.708 --> 05:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:14.868 --> 05:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully it will come out and not cover
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
it up
 
05:17:16.400 --> 05:17:17.430 align:start position:0%
it up
follow-up

05:17:17.430 --> 05:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:17:18.708 --> 05:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
05:17:20.390 --> 05:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
do you think uh therapeutics have been
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
suppressed because of the vaccine
 
05:17:26.470 --> 05:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why the eua authorization
 
05:17:28.550 --> 05:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
was allowed to be
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
come through anyway thank you
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
because the only reason for the eua is
 
05:17:34.798 --> 05:17:36.550 align:start position:0%
because the only reason for the eua is
because

05:17:36.550 --> 05:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
any chance at therapeutic therapeutic
 
05:17:39.760 --> 05:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
any chance at therapeutic therapeutic
interventions

05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
interventions
 
05:17:43.830 --> 05:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
including protocols by
 
05:17:47.350 --> 05:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
numerous groups across the country
 
05:17:49.430 --> 05:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
we're having success with
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
vitamin i ivermectin and that was
 
05:17:57.030 --> 05:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
lambasted persecuted
 
05:17:57.040 --> 05:17:57.910 align:start position:0%
lambasted persecuted
and

05:17:57.910 --> 05:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh thrown under the bus
 
05:18:01.440 --> 05:18:02.708 align:start position:0%
uh thrown under the bus
and

05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why the eua was allowed to
 
05:18:07.430 --> 05:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
stay alive
 
05:18:09.910 --> 05:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
because there was no reasonable
 
05:18:13.110 --> 05:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
alternative to treatment at the time
 
05:18:14.948 --> 05:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative whitcock thank
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you charlotte uh talk to just
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
one more i just you caught me by
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
surprise and i just want to make sure i
 
05:18:23.110 --> 05:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly you said that you
 
05:18:25.670 --> 05:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
as we got the covered vaccine in the
 
05:18:27.990 --> 05:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
colburn incident that you you the fear
 
05:18:29.590 --> 05:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
was misplaced i think that's how you
 
05:18:32.310 --> 05:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
framed it unfounded yeah unfounded okay
 
05:18:36.470 --> 05:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:38.708 --> 05:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
so you don't believe that's a founded
 
05:18:38.718 --> 05:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
so you don't believe that's a founded
fear

05:18:40.310 --> 05:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
fear
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
oh that's a real good cause for fear for
 
05:18:44.708 --> 05:18:44.718 align:start position:0%
sure but
 
05:18:48.788 --> 05:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
if the u.s were to evaluate the data
 
05:18:48.798 --> 05:18:50.628 align:start position:0%
if the u.s were to evaluate the data
of

05:18:50.628 --> 05:18:50.638 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:18:52.948 --> 05:18:52.958 align:start position:0%
people dying of covid
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
and not with kovid
 
05:18:57.030 --> 05:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
i would suspect
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
like italy
 
05:19:01.030 --> 05:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
did with their ministry of health
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
they reduced their
 
05:19:04.150 --> 05:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
number of
 
05:19:05.910 --> 05:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
people dying from covid from the
 
05:19:07.590 --> 05:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
original numbers
 
05:19:10.868 --> 05:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
by over 90 percent
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
so if you believe
 
05:19:13.200 --> 05:19:14.390 align:start position:0%
so if you believe
that

05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:16.150 --> 05:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
if we were correct
 
05:19:19.510 --> 05:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
our data that tell us that
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
it was more than 800 000 people have
 
05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
died from covid
 
05:19:25.750 --> 05:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
but to reevaluate that and to actually
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
classify it as people who died of covid
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
and not with covid with being testing
 
05:19:32.718 --> 05:19:34.390 align:start position:0%
and not with covid with being testing
positive

05:19:34.390 --> 05:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
positive
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
and for sure
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
these people most of these people were
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
elderly had many comorbidities
 
05:19:44.788 --> 05:19:44.798 align:start position:0%
health concerns
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
05:19:45.600 --> 05:19:47.030 align:start position:0%
so um

05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
when i say unfounded
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm referring to that very statistic
 
05:19:55.190 --> 05:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we all were hearing day in day out
 
05:19:57.590 --> 05:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you i i appreciate if i may i
 
05:19:59.910 --> 05:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the response i just i
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
still find uh
 
05:20:04.230 --> 05:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
by manipulating the way we
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
go back and look at the disaggregated
 
05:20:07.510 --> 05:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
that data um
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
regardless of that we know that 800 000
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
died and had some impact because of
 
05:20:11.280 --> 05:20:12.470 align:start position:0%
died and had some impact because of
covet

05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
covet
 
05:20:14.150 --> 05:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative waltz
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so are you telling me that
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
there are tens of thousands of doctors
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
across this country that have lied on
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
death certificates when they said that
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm not aware of the data and how it's
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
collected but if you if you have a death
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
certificate and
 
05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:38.958 align:start position:0%
coven 19 is on the death certificate
 
05:20:40.150 --> 05:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
a data point that
 
05:20:44.868 --> 05:20:44.878 align:start position:0%
was likely collected for this number
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing
 
05:20:50.070 --> 05:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
and if you had covid
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
it may have contributed
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
to your death
 
05:20:53.760 --> 05:20:54.548 align:start position:0%
to your death
but

05:20:54.548 --> 05:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
by having
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
things like obesity diabetes
 
05:21:02.470 --> 05:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
asthma pulmonary disease
 
05:21:05.110 --> 05:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
this may have been a contributing
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up factor and when doctors fill
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
out death certificates
 
05:21:11.110 --> 05:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
don't they usually note that if there
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
were multiple things involved in the
 
05:21:12.878 --> 05:21:15.910 align:start position:0%
were multiple things involved in the
death

05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:17.670 --> 05:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
indeed that they do
 
05:21:20.548 --> 05:21:20.558 align:start position:0%
so if we have 900 000 people who were
 
05:21:22.708 --> 05:21:22.718 align:start position:0%
said that they died of covid
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
not that they died of heart disease and
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
happened to have coveted but they died
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that tens of
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
thousands of doctors are lying when they
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not sure what you mean by
 
05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:44.390 --> 05:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah not being truthful and what they
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:52.628 --> 05:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
i i can't speak to physicians filling
 
05:21:55.350 --> 05:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
out reports like that i'm sorry
 
05:21:57.670 --> 05:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
i understand that but given that we have
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
900 000 people who are documented
 
05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
undocumented to have died of covet these
 
05:22:04.548 --> 05:22:04.558 align:start position:0%
are the people that we have documented
 
05:22:06.230 --> 05:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
not people who just died at home without
 
05:22:09.030 --> 05:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
documentation but documented cases
 
05:22:10.948 --> 05:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
05:22:13.350 --> 05:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
why that's not a valid number why you
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
question that number that we've got all
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
these people that have documented the
 
05:22:19.030 --> 05:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
cause of death and you're suggesting
 
05:22:20.868 --> 05:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
that that's not valid i'm trying to
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
understand your thinking here because
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
you're a doctor i trust doctors i trust
 
05:22:27.510 --> 05:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
that doctors tell the truth you have to
 
05:22:29.030 --> 05:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
take an oath i'm a lawyer i have to take
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
an oath we have to tell the truth and
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
05:22:33.510 --> 05:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm very confused as to how you can
 
05:22:35.270 --> 05:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
possibly say when there's nine hundred
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
thousand documented cases of covert
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
death but that's not what really
 
05:22:41.590 --> 05:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
happened in this country
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm not trying to refute the
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
number i'm just i'm just trying to
 
05:22:45.440 --> 05:22:46.548 align:start position:0%
number i'm just i'm just trying to
separate

05:22:46.548 --> 05:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:22:46.558 --> 05:22:48.150 align:start position:0%
separate
um

05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:50.548 --> 05:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
died of copied or
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
died with coped that's all i'm trying to
 
05:22:53.040 --> 05:22:55.190 align:start position:0%
died with coped that's all i'm trying to
separate

05:22:55.190 --> 05:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
separate
 
05:22:58.948 --> 05:22:58.958 align:start position:0%
further questions represent mullen
 
05:23:00.948 --> 05:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you dr york
 
05:23:03.670 --> 05:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
for taking another question uh so the
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
difference between dying with covet and
 
05:23:07.830 --> 05:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
05:23:07.840 --> 05:23:09.270 align:start position:0%
of covid
if

05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
i have uh diabetes
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
and i contract covid
 
05:23:18.390 --> 05:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i die
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's dying with covid
 
05:23:21.760 --> 05:23:23.910 align:start position:0%
that's dying with covid
unless

05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
unless
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
i didn't have diabetes or
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
if i had diabetes and i
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
didn't get covid and i didn't die
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
i mean are we
 
05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
is this not a semantics issue
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
it is a semantic issue yes yes and my my
 
05:23:42.708 --> 05:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
argument is that
 
05:23:46.230 --> 05:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
the population uh the vast majority of
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
the population is in the elderly age
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
group with multiple
 
05:23:49.840 --> 05:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
group with multiple
comorbidities

05:23:54.070 --> 05:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:23:57.670 --> 05:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
further questions yes one more thank you
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair um do we have the numbers of
 
05:24:03.430 --> 05:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
people before covert the average amount
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
of people who died a day
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
and can we compare that to like the
 
05:24:09.430 --> 05:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
average amount of people who are dying
 
05:24:09.440 --> 05:24:10.310 align:start position:0%
average amount of people who are dying
now

05:24:10.310 --> 05:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
with including covet and then
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
perhaps figure out
 
05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh how much of them or how much of an
 
05:24:20.830 --> 05:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:23.990 --> 05:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
covert yeah i mean that's a complicated
 
05:24:26.628 --> 05:24:26.638 align:start position:0%
calculation for sure um
 
05:24:29.670 --> 05:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
i think there was a insurance group uh
 
05:24:32.390 --> 05:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the western u.s that recently
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
indicated that there was a 40 increase
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
in all costs more
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol all cause mortality
 
05:24:43.990 --> 05:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
that was not attributed only to covid
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
so the
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have any numbers to share with
 
05:24:49.590 --> 05:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
you but
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
certainly going forward
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
05:24:55.670 --> 05:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
there are data being collected for
 
05:24:57.670 --> 05:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
looking as we go forward and then look
 
05:25:00.070 --> 05:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
backward as to trends for
 
05:25:00.080 --> 05:25:00.868 align:start position:0%
backward as to trends for
uh

05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
all car all cause mortality
 
05:25:06.150 --> 05:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
death and as it relates to coba death
 
05:25:11.190 --> 05:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further questions thank
 
05:25:15.350 --> 05:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
you very much doctor
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:39.750 --> 05:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%

about
 
05:26:05.120 --> 05:26:07.110 align:start position:0%

there are pathways for exemptions and i
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
know that there have been a lot of
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
situations where people have mentioned
 
05:26:22.708 --> 05:26:22.718 align:start position:0%
local control and not wanting to oversee
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
that as somebody coming from nashua i am
 
05:26:27.750 --> 05:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
pleading with you please
 
05:26:29.670 --> 05:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
make it so that these people cannot
 
05:26:33.190 --> 05:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
mandate this vaccine for attendance to
 
05:26:34.788 --> 05:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
under the state law and federal law you
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
have to give people you have to give
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
children access to a free appropriate
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
public education especially students who
 
05:26:45.270 --> 05:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
are in special education i have a child
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
with an iep and i'm struggling at this
 
05:26:50.310 --> 05:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
point to even get a mask exemption
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
granted which was provided by his
 
05:26:55.910 --> 05:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
pediatrician let alone having a vaccine
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
the issue that we're running into here
 
05:26:58.948 --> 05:26:58.958 align:start position:0%
is choice
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
and that's something that i don't hear a
 
05:27:02.390 --> 05:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
lot of people talk about it seems like
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
in that last part of this conversation
 
05:27:06.708 --> 05:27:06.718 align:start position:0%
we've gone kind of totally off the rails
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
and the issue at hand with this bill is
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting school districts from
 
05:27:14.470 --> 05:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
forcing covid19 to be one of the
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
required vaccinations for attendance at
 
05:27:19.910 --> 05:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
school now
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anyone is a parent or a
 
05:27:25.270 --> 05:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
grandparent but there have been a lot of
 
05:27:28.230 --> 05:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
correlations here that are not accurate
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
um if if your child is cr has chronic
 
05:27:36.830 --> 05:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
ear infections and they tell you
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we have this vaccine that will stop
 
05:27:41.510 --> 05:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
this we have no idea what it's going to
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
do 10 years from now and then while
 
05:27:45.270 --> 05:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
they're testing it you find out that
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
because you have a female daughter it
 
05:27:49.910 --> 05:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
may it may mess with her ovaries it may
 
05:27:51.830 --> 05:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
discount the amount of eggs that she was
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
born with you may possibly
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
make your child infertile
 
05:27:59.510 --> 05:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
you may sterilize your child
 
05:28:01.750 --> 05:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
but we can't guarantee whether or not
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
this ear infection is going to go away
 
05:28:04.948 --> 05:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
or it's not going to go away but you
 
05:28:06.390 --> 05:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
have to get this so that other people
 
05:28:09.190 --> 05:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't get this ear infection
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
because now it's communicable
 
05:28:13.270 --> 05:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds ridiculous
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
for other people to be telling me what i
 
05:28:19.910 --> 05:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
need to do with my children and their
 
05:28:22.948 --> 05:28:22.958 align:start position:0%
health decisions in order to attend a
 
05:28:22.958 --> 05:28:23.910 align:start position:0%
health decisions in order to attend a
right

05:28:23.910 --> 05:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:28:26.948 --> 05:28:26.958 align:start position:0%
to public education is absolutely
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
astounding i'm not anti-vaxx or provacs
 
05:28:33.270 --> 05:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm pro-parental choice and guardian
 
05:28:33.280 --> 05:28:34.788 align:start position:0%
i'm pro-parental choice and guardian
choice

05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:28:37.830 --> 05:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
for you guys as a as a
 
05:28:39.750 --> 05:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
communi as a committee
 
05:28:42.948 --> 05:28:42.958 align:start position:0%
to stand behind 1241 that speaks volumes
 
05:28:42.958 --> 05:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
to stand behind 1241 that speaks volumes
why

05:28:43.750 --> 05:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:28:45.590 --> 05:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
because we're limiting the uh we're
 
05:28:45.600 --> 05:28:46.868 align:start position:0%
because we're limiting the uh we're
limiting

05:28:46.868 --> 05:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
limiting
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
the requirements for children
 
05:28:52.628 --> 05:28:52.638 align:start position:0%
to have to get a vaccine that we don't
 
05:28:55.430 --> 05:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
know the long-term effects if you are
 
05:28:57.190 --> 05:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
allowing these districts to make this
 
05:28:59.510 --> 05:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccine a mandatory vaccination
 
05:29:01.350 --> 05:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
to attend public school who's going to
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
be held liable
 
05:29:05.510 --> 05:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
for any vaccine injuries is it going to
 
05:29:06.868 --> 05:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
be the school districts is it going to
 
05:29:08.708 --> 05:29:08.718 align:start position:0%
be the state who's going to take out
 
05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
that insurance policy
 
05:29:13.030 --> 05:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
the issue here is you're taking
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
you're taking a situation where there's
 
05:29:19.510 --> 05:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 99 or 99.999
 
05:29:22.070 --> 05:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
survival rate for children and it is not
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
my responsibility and i'm going to be
 
05:29:25.670 --> 05:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
the least popular person in this room
 
05:29:26.948 --> 05:29:26.958 align:start position:0%
right now
 
05:29:29.270 --> 05:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
probably if anybody's listening
 
05:29:32.070 --> 05:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
it is not my responsibility to inoculate
 
05:29:35.990 --> 05:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
my child to protect someone else
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
it just isn't
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
it is not my responsibility to lose my
 
05:29:40.878 --> 05:29:42.628 align:start position:0%
it is not my responsibility to lose my
rights

05:29:42.628 --> 05:29:42.638 align:start position:0%
rights
 
05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
because someone else is afraid that they
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
might possibly get sick
 
05:29:49.750 --> 05:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have been doing this for two years
 
05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's enough
 
05:29:53.670 --> 05:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
to force this mandate on a vaccine that
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
has now they're going through testing
 
05:29:57.350 --> 05:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the nih again has quietly been
 
05:29:57.360 --> 05:29:58.470 align:start position:0%
and the nih again has quietly been
studying

05:29:58.470 --> 05:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
studying
 
05:30:01.190 --> 05:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
the effects of this vaccine and it's i
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
mean we we could go down that rabbit
 
05:30:04.788 --> 05:30:04.798 align:start position:0%
hole but we're not going to
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
the main concern is
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
don't tell me that i have to vaccinate
 
05:30:11.190 --> 05:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
my children to attend public school so
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
that you feel protected if you have a
 
05:30:14.948 --> 05:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
child who is immune compromised you have
 
05:30:17.110 --> 05:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely every reason in the world to
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
keep your child protected
 
05:30:21.750 --> 05:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
it is not my responsibility as a citizen
 
05:30:23.910 --> 05:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
it is not my responsibility as a person
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
i live in the united states of america i
 
05:30:28.150 --> 05:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
have a freedom of choice
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
and by not prohibiting this and by not
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
supporting 1241
 
05:30:35.110 --> 05:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
you are again limiting our freedom of
 
05:30:35.120 --> 05:30:37.030 align:start position:0%
you are again limiting our freedom of
choice

05:30:37.030 --> 05:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
thank you i yield to questions i always
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that sorry
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions
 
05:30:45.830 --> 05:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for being
 
05:30:47.600 --> 05:30:49.350 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for being
here

05:30:49.350 --> 05:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:30:51.190 --> 05:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
05:31:06.788 --> 05:31:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:09.030 --> 05:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is lori ordolano
 
05:31:11.430 --> 05:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm from nashua as well
 
05:31:13.750 --> 05:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
my children are grown but i am very
 
05:31:16.948 --> 05:31:16.958 align:start position:0%
concerned about this legislation um and
 
05:31:18.948 --> 05:31:18.958 align:start position:0%
i i'm very concerned about we're doing
 
05:31:20.948 --> 05:31:20.958 align:start position:0%
to legislate and
 
05:31:23.430 --> 05:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
try to force vaccination onto a
 
05:31:26.230 --> 05:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
population that doesn't need it so i
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
support hp 1241 to prohibit this
 
05:31:29.600 --> 05:31:30.868 align:start position:0%
support hp 1241 to prohibit this
requirement

05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
05:31:32.868 --> 05:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to protect the rights
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
of parents and young adults to exercise
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
informed consent for medical decisions
 
05:31:38.868 --> 05:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
particularly when they involve
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
experimental treatments
 
05:31:43.190 --> 05:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
as we come out of this pandemic and peel
 
05:31:45.430 --> 05:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
away at the fear messaging i'm concerned
 
05:31:47.110 --> 05:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
that we're going to learn that medical
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
ethics ethical standards were
 
05:31:51.670 --> 05:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
compromised for corporate profits and
 
05:31:54.788 --> 05:31:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
how are parents supposed to effectively
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
safeguard the rights and their for their
 
05:31:59.520 --> 05:32:00.868 align:start position:0%
safeguard the rights and their for their
children

05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
when unvetted unsubstantiated data has
 
05:32:05.350 --> 05:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
been harmonized into a message that
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
eliminates choice
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
it appears that scientific debate has
 
05:32:10.470 --> 05:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
been eliminated
 
05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
the absence of this debate on covet
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
treatment created a fear that focused us
 
05:32:17.190 --> 05:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
on dying
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
if the real message of viable treatment
 
05:32:22.708 --> 05:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
protocols vaccine injury and possible
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
death from vaccines were broadcast on
 
05:32:26.868 --> 05:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
major media networks
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
information choice and knowledge
 
05:32:32.628 --> 05:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
would have mitigated a lot of this fear
 
05:32:34.470 --> 05:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
something is terribly wrong when the
 
05:32:36.310 --> 05:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
government denies us this type of
 
05:32:36.320 --> 05:32:37.990 align:start position:0%
government denies us this type of
information

05:32:37.990 --> 05:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:32:40.150 --> 05:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
anyone with a message that created
 
05:32:42.150 --> 05:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
was reputationally dis destroyed experts
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
we could not get a balanced view
 
05:32:51.350 --> 05:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
there are too many pandemic legislative
 
05:32:53.990 --> 05:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
packages being pushed through right now
 
05:32:57.430 --> 05:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
that have eliminated medical bioethics
 
05:32:59.830 --> 05:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
thinking people and more importantly
 
05:33:01.750 --> 05:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
parents and young adults
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
need to be able to ask why and how
 
05:33:04.000 --> 05:33:05.270 align:start position:0%
need to be able to ask why and how
questions

05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:33:07.510 --> 05:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
the active manipulation and management
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
of pandemic data is stunning
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
i think when history memorializes all of
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
this we're going to hold our heads in
 
05:33:16.390 --> 05:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
disgust and recognize that three
 
05:33:17.750 --> 05:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
generations of health have been
 
05:33:17.760 --> 05:33:19.350 align:start position:0%
generations of health have been
compromised

05:33:19.350 --> 05:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
05:33:21.030 --> 05:33:21.040 align:start position:0%
and there were a few things mentioned
 
05:33:22.868 --> 05:33:22.878 align:start position:0%
about natural immunity that were brought
 
05:33:24.470 --> 05:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
up here there's a couple things i'd like
 
05:33:25.910 --> 05:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to
 
05:33:28.470 --> 05:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
the big concern i have is that when all
 
05:33:31.110 --> 05:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
of this started the doctors did not seem
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
at all interested in performing the
 
05:33:34.948 --> 05:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
tests on the people coming in with covid
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
or before promoting um vaccinations to
 
05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
see if they had natural immunity they
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
did not collect that kind of test data
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
they weren't interested in my neighbor
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
takes her dog to the vet and gets it
 
05:33:48.868 --> 05:33:48.878 align:start position:0%
tightered to see if it has immunity so
 
05:33:51.030 --> 05:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't get vaccinated
 
05:33:53.030 --> 05:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
and that's readily available they
 
05:33:54.548 --> 05:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
weren't doing it for us for this
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic and i think that's how we could
 
05:33:59.190 --> 05:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
look at natural immunity and understand
 
05:33:59.200 --> 05:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
look at natural immunity and understand
it

05:34:00.070 --> 05:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
i know people who have had natural
 
05:34:02.240 --> 05:34:03.270 align:start position:0%
i know people who have had natural
immunity

05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
immunity
 
05:34:05.510 --> 05:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
for 18 months that have had coveted and
 
05:34:08.390 --> 05:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
they get it checked every six months
 
05:34:10.548 --> 05:34:10.558 align:start position:0%
so the number of deaths
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
when we talk about whether that number
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
is real what we're not talking about is
 
05:34:16.948 --> 05:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that we failed to offer proper
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
treatment protocols early on
 
05:34:21.430 --> 05:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
we restricted
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
off-label medications
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
cobit is an inflammatory disease and
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
we've known how to treat inflammation in
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
this country for 40 years
 
05:34:32.548 --> 05:34:32.558 align:start position:0%
how did we miss the broad side of the
 
05:34:32.558 --> 05:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
how did we miss the broad side of the
barn

05:34:33.510 --> 05:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
barn
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
because we had pharmaceutical companies
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
that were working on expensive new
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
developments that instead of costing
 
05:34:42.788 --> 05:34:42.798 align:start position:0%
pennies for a dose cost a thousand or
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
two or three thousand dollars a dose and
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
we had to do it that way
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
they were forced
 
05:34:50.150 --> 05:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
so those numbers
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
i think would have been a lot lower had
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
there been choices out there
 
05:34:56.390 --> 05:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
myocarditis that was brought up while i
 
05:34:58.470 --> 05:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
was sitting here listening to what are
 
05:35:01.270 --> 05:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
the reports i googled on my phone i'm
 
05:35:03.190 --> 05:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
always interested in data what is the
 
05:35:06.310 --> 05:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
data say about myocarditis caused by
 
05:35:09.350 --> 05:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
copin 19 infections i couldn't find any
 
05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
data online
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
what it said is it wasn't really there
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't certainty that it was linked
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
you can find more data on myocarditis
 
05:35:19.670 --> 05:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
with vaccination online but i couldn't
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
find the other so that's a problem
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
there's not a balanced view of data that
 
05:35:26.948 --> 05:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
the concept and i'm going to be as
 
05:35:30.628 --> 05:35:30.638 align:start position:0%
unpopular as the lady before me who
 
05:35:33.110 --> 05:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
spoke that we need to inoculate all of
 
05:35:35.190 --> 05:35:35.200 align:start position:0%
the children to protect
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
some other child that might have an
 
05:35:41.270 --> 05:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
illness is just not fair or reasonable
 
05:35:44.868 --> 05:35:44.878 align:start position:0%
i went to my board of aldermen chamber
 
05:35:47.590 --> 05:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago and the masking debate was
 
05:35:49.830 --> 05:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
running hot and heavy there's a lot of
 
05:35:52.628 --> 05:35:52.638 align:start position:0%
people who want the mandate taken down
 
05:35:55.270 --> 05:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the aldermen said hey i have
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
a two-year-old who's not vaccinated
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's your responsibility nashua the
 
05:36:02.708 --> 05:36:02.718 align:start position:0%
entire city to keep your mask on for my
 
05:36:02.718 --> 05:36:04.548 align:start position:0%
entire city to keep your mask on for my
two-year-old

05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
two-year-old
 
05:36:06.310 --> 05:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
what they feel to realize is their
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
two-year-old is more at risk of dying in
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
a bicycle accident
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
than from covet
 
05:36:15.270 --> 05:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
should we mandate that no child can ride
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
a bike
 
05:36:18.548 --> 05:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
and for that matter all adults shouldn't
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
either because it would hurt the child's
 
05:36:20.080 --> 05:36:21.670 align:start position:0%
either because it would hurt the child's
feelings

05:36:21.670 --> 05:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
feelings
 
05:36:24.150 --> 05:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
we need to stop this
 
05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
i am so opposed to this
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
mandating and regulations that are being
 
05:36:32.948 --> 05:36:32.958 align:start position:0%
laid down on this pandemic
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
because i feel like we lost our minds
 
05:36:38.708 --> 05:36:38.718 align:start position:0%
we rushed we went 100 miles an hour no
 
05:36:40.948 --> 05:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
one put the brakes on to say wait a
 
05:36:43.030 --> 05:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
minute let's take a look at this
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i think it's starting to roll out
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
these doctors that were shunned are now
 
05:36:49.430 --> 05:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
being invited to europe to speak to you
 
05:36:51.190 --> 05:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
know presidents and prime ministers
 
05:36:53.030 --> 05:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
about you know what's really going on
 
05:36:55.510 --> 05:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
with their data over there
 
05:36:55.520 --> 05:36:56.628 align:start position:0%
with their data over there
okay

05:36:56.628 --> 05:36:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
the united states not going to lead on
 
05:37:00.788 --> 05:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
this anymore because i believe we really
 
05:37:02.868 --> 05:37:02.878 align:start position:0%
sullied our reputation
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to be some
 
05:37:06.070 --> 05:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
preeminent medical
 
05:37:08.150 --> 05:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
group that is going to have the answers
 
05:37:08.160 --> 05:37:08.948 align:start position:0%
group that is going to have the answers
when

05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
something major happens
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
we're not gonna look we don't shine
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
bright through this
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:37:18.708 --> 05:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
and i i i at this point and i wore my
 
05:37:20.708 --> 05:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
mask like my underwear i flipped and
 
05:37:22.628 --> 05:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
believed in my mask three weeks before
 
05:37:24.150 --> 05:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else did
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
i shed my mask in december after doing
 
05:37:28.230 --> 05:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
more research
 
05:37:28.240 --> 05:37:29.190 align:start position:0%
more research
done

05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:37:31.510 --> 05:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
and while nashua has a mass mandate i
 
05:37:33.430 --> 05:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
don't shop in nashua anymore although i
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
live there i don't i go to the
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns
 
05:37:36.160 --> 05:37:37.030 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns

i'm just here briefly to provide some
 
05:38:24.240 --> 05:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
i'm just here briefly to provide some
information

05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
about hp 1241.
 
05:38:30.150 --> 05:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
the way that the department reads the
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill is it would prohibit
 
05:38:34.390 --> 05:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
individual school districts from
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%

currently the school district says we
 
05:38:40.798 --> 05:38:41.590 align:start position:0%
currently the school district says we
have

have
 
05:38:43.030 --> 05:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
read the bill and reached out to the
 
05:38:44.868 --> 05:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
department of justice does not currently
 
05:38:47.030 --> 05:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
have that authority um so it would be
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
mandating something that uh prohibiting
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
something that they don't have the
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
authority to do right now and we just
 
05:38:53.868 --> 05:38:53.878 align:start position:0%

that they um
 
05:39:17.750 --> 05:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
school individual school districts do
 
05:39:19.990 --> 05:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
not have the the authority to mandate
 
05:39:22.628 --> 05:39:22.638 align:start position:0%

thanks abby for coming in this afternoon
 
05:39:35.190 --> 05:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
am i correct did i read something in the
 
05:39:37.030 --> 05:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
paper this morning that says that the
 
05:39:38.788 --> 05:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
public health offices have said that
 
05:39:38.798 --> 05:39:40.470 align:start position:0%
public health offices have said that
they

05:39:40.470 --> 05:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:39:43.670 --> 05:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
there is no plan for mandating a vaccine
 
05:39:45.510 --> 05:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
for school-age kids
 
05:39:47.750 --> 05:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct we testified yesterday
 
05:39:51.430 --> 05:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
on a bill in uh house hhs
 
05:39:53.670 --> 05:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
we do not have any plans at this time to
 
05:39:55.430 --> 05:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
mandate the covenant vaccine for
 
05:39:57.590 --> 05:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
school-aged children if we were to do
 
05:39:59.510 --> 05:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be
 
05:39:59.520 --> 05:40:01.350 align:start position:0%
that it would be
under

05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:40:02.948 --> 05:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
when the resources and the times the
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
time is right to do that
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
we don't feel that that's necessary at
 
05:40:09.430 --> 05:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:11.030 --> 05:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
yeah rep senator boehm and then
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you taking
 
05:40:17.190 --> 05:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
the question so you said so what does
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
one do
 
05:40:21.350 --> 05:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
if their school district is mandating it
 
05:40:23.430 --> 05:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
what their resource that the people can
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
take since you said they do not have the
 
05:40:27.110 --> 05:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
authority to do it
 
05:40:28.230 --> 05:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question my
 
05:40:29.830 --> 05:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is individual school
 
05:40:31.430 --> 05:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
districts do not have the authority to
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
mandate vaccines
 
05:40:34.948 --> 05:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
they can make recommendations about
 
05:40:36.868 --> 05:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
masking and testing in schools but right
 
05:40:38.470 --> 05:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
now they they don't have the authority
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
to do that so i i don't think a school
 
05:40:41.670 --> 05:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
district would go ahead and try to do
 
05:40:41.680 --> 05:40:42.628 align:start position:0%
district would go ahead and try to do
that

05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
but if a school district does what can
 
05:40:46.628 --> 05:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
somebody do
 
05:40:48.708 --> 05:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
to stop the school district from doing
 
05:40:48.718 --> 05:40:49.990 align:start position:0%
to stop the school district from doing
it

05:40:49.990 --> 05:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
well according to 141 rsa 141c only the
 
05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
services has that authority to add
 
05:40:58.788 --> 05:40:58.798 align:start position:0%
school dis vaccines to school
 
05:41:00.788 --> 05:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
recommendations for requirements for for
 
05:41:00.798 --> 05:41:02.070 align:start position:0%
recommendations for requirements for for
school

05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:41:03.750 --> 05:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be it would be against
 
05:41:09.830 --> 05:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.150 --> 05:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh are there any other questions
 
05:41:15.270 --> 05:41:15.280 align:start position:0%

hospital 1241 is not necessary
 
05:41:30.310 --> 05:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh from the way that the department of
 
05:41:31.830 --> 05:41:31.840 align:start position:0%

05:41:38.240 --> 05:41:39.590 align:start position:0%

accommodation

05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
05:41:46.230 --> 05:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to invite laurie back
 
05:41:53.830 --> 05:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:56.070 --> 05:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
i'll be super quick um i want to talk
 
05:41:58.470 --> 05:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
about boards of health nashua is a big
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
city and we have a board of health that
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
has what i consider three pretty
 
05:42:02.000 --> 05:42:03.190 align:start position:0%
has what i consider three pretty
qualified

05:42:03.190 --> 05:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
people on it and that two are doctors
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
and one's a dentist
 
05:42:08.310 --> 05:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
internal medicine pediatrician and a
 
05:42:11.190 --> 05:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
dentist most boards of health for small
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
communities consists of the fire chief
 
05:42:15.350 --> 05:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
our surrounding areas the fire chief
 
05:42:17.190 --> 05:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
litchfield that used to be the building
 
05:42:18.948 --> 05:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
inspector was the board of health person
 
05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
too so a lot of small communities don't
 
05:42:24.628 --> 05:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
have the expertise of a of a of a
 
05:42:27.270 --> 05:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
talented board degreed in some level of
 
05:42:29.590 --> 05:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
medicine the board of health in nashua
 
05:42:31.830 --> 05:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
has been the most frustrating thing
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
to deal with for me
 
05:42:35.990 --> 05:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
they don't answer questions
 
05:42:37.830 --> 05:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the last four meetings they cancelled
 
05:42:39.750 --> 05:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
public input twice
 
05:42:41.750 --> 05:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
they have never held a form to allow
 
05:42:44.310 --> 05:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
questions if you email them in and ask
 
05:42:45.750 --> 05:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
them to put them on the agenda and
 
05:42:48.708 --> 05:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
discuss them they're ignored if you want
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
to challenge some of the things that are
 
05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
being stated like they're pushing
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
boosters for all children
 
05:42:55.510 --> 05:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
why are we pushing a booster two
 
05:42:58.548 --> 05:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
variants past now on children
 
05:43:00.948 --> 05:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
you know what's the point of that
 
05:43:03.510 --> 05:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
we had two hospital executives come in
 
05:43:05.110 --> 05:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
at the last meeting
 
05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
and state that based on what they're
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
seeing in our local hospitals
 
05:43:11.590 --> 05:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
that those coming into i see those
 
05:43:13.830 --> 05:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
coming into the hospital 50 it was a 50
 
05:43:17.350 --> 05:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
50 split 50 had had the vaccination 50
 
05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
percent didn't so when the board of
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
health said hey are you seeing all these
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated people filling hospital
 
05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
beds both executives said no
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
it's equal
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
the second question was well are you
 
05:43:30.548 --> 05:43:30.558 align:start position:0%
seeing a benefit
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
in the recovery and the level of
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
sickness for those who are boosted and
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
they said no it's negligible
 
05:43:39.830 --> 05:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
so these boards of health are very ours
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
in nashua is so frustrating the minutes
 
05:43:43.990 --> 05:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
came out from the last meeting in in
 
05:43:47.510 --> 05:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably 125 point font the first header
 
05:43:51.030 --> 05:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
on the minutes said no public comment
 
05:43:53.110 --> 05:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be the bolded comment of
 
05:43:54.788 --> 05:43:54.798 align:start position:0%
your meeting
 
05:43:56.070 --> 05:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
this has
 
05:43:57.190 --> 05:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
we don't want to be talking about a
 
05:43:58.868 --> 05:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
board of health or a health officer we
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
want to be talking about this bill okay
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
so this is why i think this bill is
 
05:44:05.830 --> 05:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
important for nashua
 
05:44:07.990 --> 05:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
because i don't think nashua will listen
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
to dhhs or if there's any level of
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation that's allowed in law
 
05:44:17.030 --> 05:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
nashua will interpret it in their own
 
05:44:19.270 --> 05:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
method and come up and say nope you know
 
05:44:22.230 --> 05:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
what we have the right and we'll do it
 
05:44:24.070 --> 05:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
it's been one of the most stringent
 
05:44:26.708 --> 05:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
areas for closure 13 months of school
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
closure masking all year long with no
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
break at all
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
they take it to the extreme so to me
 
05:44:36.948 --> 05:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is very important and i think
 
05:44:38.868 --> 05:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
the vaccine served a purpose for the
 
05:44:41.510 --> 05:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
older population from the get-go
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
this older population should have been
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the data showed that
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
but for the younger population i can't
 
05:44:49.830 --> 05:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
see where it ever showed that and i'm
 
05:44:51.830 --> 05:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
not even certain regardless of the bill
 
05:44:54.470 --> 05:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
why we push that so much now thank you
 
05:44:56.070 --> 05:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
05:44:58.070 --> 05:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
have you done this card yet
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
hi i'm allison dyer i'm also from nashua
 
05:45:15.120 --> 05:45:16.150 align:start position:0%
hi i'm allison dyer i'm also from nashua
um

05:45:16.150 --> 05:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is necessary and now
 
05:45:21.110 --> 05:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm slightly confused after abby spoke
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
because i thought this this bill was
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
necessary because
 
05:45:28.310 --> 05:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative marsh put in 1633 to
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
require it through 141. so
 
05:45:34.708 --> 05:45:34.718 align:start position:0%
to me as a parent
 
05:45:38.708 --> 05:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
this is not political it's parental and
 
05:45:41.750 --> 05:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
this is necessary to protect
 
05:45:44.628 --> 05:45:44.638 align:start position:0%
um my rights as a parent and and my
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
directive to you know the what is it the
 
05:45:47.840 --> 05:45:48.548 align:start position:0%
directive to you know the what is it the
uh

05:45:48.548 --> 05:45:48.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:45:50.708 --> 05:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
the due process class where i direct the
 
05:45:52.948 --> 05:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
education and upbringing of my child
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's in my direct care so
 
05:45:57.590 --> 05:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
that that would be
 
05:45:57.600 --> 05:45:58.788 align:start position:0%
that that would be
that

05:45:58.788 --> 05:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:45:58.798 --> 05:45:59.910 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:45:59.910 --> 05:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:01.350 --> 05:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
i am
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a child of the 80s so i'm kind of
 
05:46:04.868 --> 05:46:04.878 align:start position:0%
looking at this like you know how i came
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
up and and what what has changed now um
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not really sure what's different
 
05:46:11.190 --> 05:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
about covet 19
 
05:46:11.200 --> 05:46:13.590 align:start position:0%
about covet 19
um

05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:13.600 --> 05:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
that

05:46:14.470 --> 05:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
as the lady before me spoke that we we
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
kind of all have just lost our minds i
 
05:46:21.110 --> 05:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
mean i'm the the child of a nurse uh
 
05:46:23.430 --> 05:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
she's been an icu nurse for 47 years i
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
myself work in healthcare on the
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
administrative side i'm confused by all
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
necessary push i was confused with the
 
05:46:36.070 --> 05:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
the hb 1633 and because of hp
 
05:46:39.190 --> 05:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
1633 i felt like 1241 is absolutely
 
05:46:39.200 --> 05:46:40.390 align:start position:0%
1633 i felt like 1241 is absolutely
necessary

05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
05:46:40.400 --> 05:46:42.548 align:start position:0%
necessary
um

05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:44.868 --> 05:46:44.878 align:start position:0%
as the mother to a seven-year-old i i
 
05:46:46.470 --> 05:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
have thought the immune system since i
 
05:46:48.230 --> 05:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
was a kid was a wonderful thing and i
 
05:46:49.830 --> 05:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
know there's been some question about
 
05:46:51.350 --> 05:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know natural immunity and things of
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
that nature but
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
um my child has never had
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
the traditional cova test without be pcr
 
05:46:59.750 --> 05:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
05:47:01.750 --> 05:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
but she has had a coping antibody test
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
she said two
 
05:47:04.948 --> 05:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
and she's had two
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
in 13 months one after six months and
 
05:47:10.150 --> 05:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
then another seven months later
 
05:47:11.910 --> 05:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
and her code antibiotics has shown
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
reactive this entire time and if you all
 
05:47:16.470 --> 05:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
check your emails i have sent you
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
13 months of reactive antibiotics for a
 
05:47:21.030 --> 05:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old and i'm not even quite
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
sure when she actually was sick because
 
05:47:24.868 --> 05:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
she has environmental allergies i
 
05:47:26.708 --> 05:47:26.718 align:start position:0%
thought maybe it was an allergy cycle
 
05:47:26.718 --> 05:47:27.670 align:start position:0%
thought maybe it was an allergy cycle
but

05:47:27.670 --> 05:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know
 
05:47:31.270 --> 05:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
and my pediatrician said to me that i
 
05:47:33.670 --> 05:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
was the first parent to ask
 
05:47:35.750 --> 05:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
for an antibody test she wasn't even
 
05:47:38.150 --> 05:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
quite sure how to order it
 
05:47:39.910 --> 05:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
and that's sad to me because when i
 
05:47:40.948 --> 05:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
think of
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
i mean i have a few friends who have
 
05:47:45.270 --> 05:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
adopted children from other countries
 
05:47:47.110 --> 05:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
and they come here those kids have no
 
05:47:48.868 --> 05:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
medical history
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
when they get here we don't just
 
05:47:53.350 --> 05:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
start inoculating them and giving them
 
05:47:55.910 --> 05:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
immunizations we we take a whole picture
 
05:47:58.788 --> 05:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
of that child we we you know we do lab
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
work we do scans we do all those types
 
05:48:02.070 --> 05:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
of things for a reason
 
05:48:03.750 --> 05:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then we make a vaccine schedule
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
based on what
 
05:48:07.510 --> 05:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
that shows what the blood work shows
 
05:48:10.230 --> 05:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
what the scans show all of that um we
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to just guess so
 
05:48:15.510 --> 05:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
for me i wouldn't want to just guess and
 
05:48:15.520 --> 05:48:16.310 align:start position:0%
for me i wouldn't want to just guess and
and

05:48:16.310 --> 05:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:48:18.150 --> 05:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
as i think some other people have stated
 
05:48:20.788 --> 05:48:20.798 align:start position:0%
too that the um
 
05:48:24.470 --> 05:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
the fda advisory committee dr rubin
 
05:48:26.150 --> 05:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
who also was the lead editor for new
 
05:48:27.750 --> 05:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
england journal of medicine said we're
 
05:48:29.430 --> 05:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
never going to learn how safe this
 
05:48:31.670 --> 05:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
vaccine is until we start giving it that
 
05:48:33.190 --> 05:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't give me a lot of confidence as a
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
parent as a parent who has been
 
05:48:35.280 --> 05:48:36.548 align:start position:0%
parent as a parent who has been
tracking

05:48:36.548 --> 05:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
05:48:38.470 --> 05:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the fact that my child is showing
 
05:48:41.510 --> 05:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
reactive covet antibodies for 13 months
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i myself
 
05:48:45.110 --> 05:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
i donate blood every year which is how i
 
05:48:47.910 --> 05:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
found out i myself had coved um they
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
sent me my blood results in the mail and
 
05:48:51.030 --> 05:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
said you covered i have copic antibodies
 
05:48:52.310 --> 05:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i said oh this is a good thing to
 
05:48:53.590 --> 05:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
track i'll do this little experiment on
 
05:48:55.990 --> 05:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
myself um
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
and i have done that every six months i
 
05:49:00.868 --> 05:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
have had a cove antibody titer pulled
 
05:49:03.190 --> 05:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
and i still show reactive and i haven't
 
05:49:04.788 --> 05:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
been sick and i understand that that is
 
05:49:07.190 --> 05:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
not everyone's story that's not
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
everyone's case
 
05:49:08.638 --> 05:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
everyone's case
but

05:49:10.230 --> 05:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:13.590 --> 05:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
i haven't been sick again and i haven't
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
given it to anybody that i'm aware of
 
05:49:18.868 --> 05:49:18.878 align:start position:0%
and and neither has my child and
 
05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
why this is good is because for for for
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
all of history until covet happened
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
we've kind of thrown that out the the
 
05:49:29.030 --> 05:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
proverbial window of things that we we
 
05:49:31.590 --> 05:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
used to trust in things like you know i
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
mean even the cdc website talks all the
 
05:49:35.670 --> 05:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
time about the mmr and and and
 
05:49:37.270 --> 05:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
chickenpox and things like that i had
 
05:49:39.270 --> 05:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
chickenpox i didn't have the chickenpox
 
05:49:42.310 --> 05:49:42.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine i understand that things like
 
05:49:44.788 --> 05:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
you know uh the covet is different
 
05:49:47.190 --> 05:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
like hiv is a retrovirus so like it's
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be the same type of thing
 
05:49:49.120 --> 05:49:52.708 align:start position:0%
not going to be the same type of thing
but

05:49:52.708 --> 05:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is in response to
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
something that someone else in this
 
05:50:00.150 --> 05:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
legislature is trying to do and it's
 
05:50:01.910 --> 05:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to be the protection and again i
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
know i'm from nashua
 
05:50:06.150 --> 05:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
and a couple people here are as well but
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're right
 
05:50:09.990 --> 05:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
nashua whether it's the board of
 
05:50:11.510 --> 05:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
education or the board of health or
 
05:50:14.708 --> 05:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
whatever will find a way
 
05:50:18.150 --> 05:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
to try to do this because that and they
 
05:50:18.160 --> 05:50:19.030 align:start position:0%
to try to do this because that and they
they

05:50:19.030 --> 05:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:50:21.030 --> 05:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
feel that it's right i'm not really sure
 
05:50:22.548 --> 05:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
what they feel or what they think but
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:50:27.030 --> 05:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
as a parent i i need
 
05:50:28.628 --> 05:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
we're in a place now which is very sad
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
because earlier today we testified on
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
the the parents bill of rights
 
05:50:35.110 --> 05:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
it's sad right now i'm in a place where
 
05:50:36.708 --> 05:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
i need your help
 
05:50:38.788 --> 05:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
as the legislative people to protect my
 
05:50:40.548 --> 05:50:40.558 align:start position:0%
rights as a parent so that i can still
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
send my child to school
 
05:50:44.788 --> 05:50:44.798 align:start position:0%
our own new hampshire vaccine schedule
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
as you all are aware of
 
05:50:49.350 --> 05:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
it lists natural immunity as
 
05:50:51.430 --> 05:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
in lieu of if you can prove through
 
05:50:53.190 --> 05:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
laboratory results
 
05:50:55.110 --> 05:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
that you have natural immunity then you
 
05:50:56.628 --> 05:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
don't need this vaccine and you submit
 
05:50:58.708 --> 05:50:58.718 align:start position:0%
that to your kid's school that's what my
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
parents did for me i i dug it out of the
 
05:51:03.270 --> 05:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
cabinet the other day to look i said i i
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
did what did you put down what did you
 
05:51:07.030 --> 05:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
write for me with chickenpox and it's
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's there she included my lab titer
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
test and i went to school and it was no
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
problem and
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm sad to be here today
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
to ask you to just let us keep our
 
05:51:18.558 --> 05:51:20.310 align:start position:0%
to ask you to just let us keep our
parental

05:51:20.310 --> 05:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
parental
 
05:51:23.030 --> 05:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
ability with risk there must be choice
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
and right now i feel like we're
 
05:51:28.310 --> 05:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
someone like my daughter is showing the
 
05:51:29.830 --> 05:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
natural immunity for the length of time
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
that she is if if it ever wanes and you
 
05:51:34.230 --> 05:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
know as someone who has worked in health
 
05:51:35.670 --> 05:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
care uh
 
05:51:37.510 --> 05:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
the flu
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine was was mandatory but had been
 
05:51:42.548 --> 05:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
out and fda approved for seven years
 
05:51:44.788 --> 05:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
we had seven years of data to look at
 
05:51:47.270 --> 05:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
if in the future we get five
 
05:51:47.280 --> 05:51:48.470 align:start position:0%
if in the future we get five
seven

05:51:48.470 --> 05:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
seven
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
ten years data set to look at for these
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
kids and we can see that the risk
 
05:51:55.350 --> 05:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio is there
 
05:51:57.510 --> 05:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
let's look back at it but right now i'm
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
asking you to support this because
 
05:51:59.760 --> 05:52:00.590 align:start position:0%
asking you to support this because
if

05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:52:04.150 --> 05:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
1633 goes anywhere which i'm now like i
 
05:52:05.830 --> 05:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
said i'm a little confused
 
05:52:09.270 --> 05:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
as to what that means what abby said
 
05:52:09.280 --> 05:52:10.070 align:start position:0%
as to what that means what abby said
then

05:52:10.070 --> 05:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:52:11.590 --> 05:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
we need this
 
05:52:13.270 --> 05:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm asking for your help with that
 
05:52:16.310 --> 05:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much uh any
 
05:52:16.320 --> 05:52:18.948 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much uh any

thank you very much
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any more cards

good so we're going to close this
hearing

05:52:28.708 --> 05:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:30.948 --> 05:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
that was our last hearing for today and
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
this committee's going to go into we're
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
going to call the commissioner up and

get him over here now he was here
 
05:52:37.590 --> 05:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
waiting for us
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
so i'll call him up so let's take about
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
a 15-minute break for him to walk over
 
05:52:43.030 --> 05:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
from the ag building and
 
05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:32.788 --> 05:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:32.798 --> 05:53:54.788 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:53:54.788 --> 05:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.910 --> 05:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:17.350 --> 05:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to start here in about
 
05:54:31.030 --> 05:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:31.040 --> 05:56:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
hey

05:56:39.270 --> 05:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:41.750 --> 05:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay folks i know it's been a long day
 
05:56:44.548 --> 05:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
but we're going to continue now
 
05:56:46.788 --> 05:56:46.798 align:start position:0%
we're very fortunate to have the
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture here
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
in marketing
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
and he's going to
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
speak to us a little bit about the we
 
05:56:56.070 --> 05:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
have two bills this afternoon and he's
 
05:56:58.230 --> 05:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
going to speak to 1164.
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
this is a bill revising the agriculture
 
05:57:02.470 --> 05:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
and the classroom committee
 
05:57:02.480 --> 05:57:04.708 align:start position:0%
and the classroom committee
um

05:57:04.708 --> 05:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:07.030 --> 05:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
a bill which i didn't know much about i
 
05:57:08.868 --> 05:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
didn't know we had such an organization
 
05:57:11.270 --> 05:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
before this bill came forward
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
sean do you want to speak at all to it
 
05:57:17.030 --> 05:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
first or i'm sure there might be a few
 
05:57:20.470 --> 05:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions that come from i i would um so
 
05:57:23.110 --> 05:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
first of all my sincere apologies
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
to the committee for missing
 
05:57:27.430 --> 05:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
the original hearing on this i just had
 
05:57:27.440 --> 05:57:28.470 align:start position:0%
the original hearing on this i just had
every

05:57:28.470 --> 05:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
every
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
things going in so many different
 
05:57:32.310 --> 05:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
directions and i actually thought that
 
05:57:34.470 --> 05:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
wednesday was tuesday so i showed up on
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
05:57:37.510 --> 05:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh i showed up for the hearing on
 
05:57:39.670 --> 05:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
wednesday thinking it was tuesday
 
05:57:41.910 --> 05:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that's what happened to me
 
05:57:43.430 --> 05:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i apologize
 
05:57:48.548 --> 05:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:48.558 --> 05:57:49.990 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:57:49.990 --> 05:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
you you should know me well enough
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative porter to believe that
 
05:57:58.150 --> 05:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:59.110 --> 05:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:58:00.868 --> 05:58:00.878 align:start position:0%
um so
 
05:58:03.190 --> 05:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
the interesting thing here is that there
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
has been an agriculture in the classroom
 
05:58:06.160 --> 05:58:07.910 align:start position:0%
has been an agriculture in the classroom
committee

05:58:07.910 --> 05:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:58:10.548 --> 05:58:10.558 align:start position:0%
for many many years
 
05:58:13.350 --> 05:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't understand the full history
 
05:58:15.990 --> 05:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
but that has existed
 
05:58:17.830 --> 05:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
as a separate
 
05:58:17.840 --> 05:58:19.190 align:start position:0%
as a separate
non-profit

05:58:19.190 --> 05:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
05:58:19.200 --> 05:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
non-profit
organization

05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
but within its charter they have the
 
05:58:25.830 --> 05:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
governor making all these appointments
 
05:58:27.910 --> 05:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
well of course you a non-profit can't
 
05:58:30.230 --> 05:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
tell the governor to make appointments
 
05:58:33.030 --> 05:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then a number of years ago
 
05:58:35.430 --> 05:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
ag in the classroom committee was formed
 
05:58:39.990 --> 05:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
having governor making appointments
 
05:58:40.000 --> 05:58:41.190 align:start position:0%
having governor making appointments
essentially

05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
the same people were involved so if you
 
05:58:45.590 --> 05:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
looked at their charge and you looked at
 
05:58:48.070 --> 05:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
their membership they were identical
 
05:58:48.080 --> 05:58:48.948 align:start position:0%
their membership they were identical
but

05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:58:48.958 --> 05:58:50.390 align:start position:0%
but
essentially

05:58:50.390 --> 05:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
05:58:51.990 --> 05:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
the two never met
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
so what i have done at this point with
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
the cooperation of the governor's office
 
05:59:00.070 --> 05:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
was actually have the appointments made
 
05:59:00.080 --> 05:59:01.110 align:start position:0%
was actually have the appointments made
under

05:59:01.110 --> 05:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
under
 
05:59:03.670 --> 05:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
what is the rsa number here
 
05:59:05.350 --> 05:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
the appointments have been made for the
 
05:59:08.150 --> 05:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
most part there's some corp some under
 
05:59:10.948 --> 05:59:10.958 align:start position:0%
rsa 425 25
 
05:59:12.548 --> 05:59:12.558 align:start position:0%
most of the appointments have been made
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
at least to the degree that the
 
05:59:16.470 --> 05:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
organizations have existed or been
 
05:59:16.480 --> 05:59:17.830 align:start position:0%
organizations have existed or been
cooperative

05:59:17.830 --> 05:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
05:59:20.628 --> 05:59:20.638 align:start position:0%
so we've lined things up
 
05:59:22.470 --> 05:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
but the problem is with the existing
 
05:59:24.390 --> 05:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
board is they said well we
 
05:59:26.070 --> 05:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
a non-profit
 
05:59:30.548 --> 05:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
uh and for good reason because one of
 
05:59:32.708 --> 05:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
the things that farm bureau
 
05:59:34.788 --> 05:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
has been very gracious in doing as part
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
of their dues a dollar
 
05:59:39.430 --> 05:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
from their dues goes to ag in the
 
05:59:39.440 --> 05:59:41.030 align:start position:0%
from their dues goes to ag in the
classroom

05:59:41.030 --> 05:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
05:59:43.670 --> 05:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
and they also allow for additional
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
donations to be made through the farm
 
05:59:48.230 --> 05:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
bureau membership
 
05:59:50.708 --> 05:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
and so that have in other donations come
 
05:59:52.708 --> 05:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
in and so having the ability to be a
 
05:59:52.718 --> 05:59:54.070 align:start position:0%
in and so having the ability to be a
non-profit

05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
is very important to the actual
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
operation of ag in the classroom so
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
working with the atten attorney
 
06:00:01.590 --> 06:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
and the existing ag in the classroom
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee we found a way
 
06:00:05.440 --> 06:00:06.470 align:start position:0%
committee we found a way
to

06:00:06.470 --> 06:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:08.948 --> 06:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
merge the two and finally have just one
 
06:00:08.958 --> 06:00:10.310 align:start position:0%
merge the two and finally have just one
organization

06:00:10.310 --> 06:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
06:00:12.470 --> 06:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
that accomplishes the goal of what the
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
state was looking for and for what the
 
06:00:17.670 --> 06:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit is looking for
 
06:00:19.510 --> 06:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations that were
 
06:00:19.520 --> 06:00:20.628 align:start position:0%
some of the organizations that were
listed

06:00:20.628 --> 06:00:20.638 align:start position:0%
listed
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
were non-existent
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
there is one
 
06:00:26.548 --> 06:00:26.558 align:start position:0%
mistake that ended up
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
06:00:31.590 --> 06:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
so if you have the numbered pages
 
06:00:34.708 --> 06:00:34.718 align:start position:0%
it's line 28 of
 
06:00:36.548 --> 06:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
essentially the first page
 
06:00:38.628 --> 06:00:38.638 align:start position:0%
and it says a a representative of the
 
06:00:42.070 --> 06:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire plant growers association
 
06:00:44.948 --> 06:00:44.958 align:start position:0%
the plant growers association nominally
 
06:00:46.948 --> 06:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
exists but they don't actually have an
 
06:00:49.350 --> 06:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
active membership and they're they exist
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
for some other reasons
 
06:00:54.310 --> 06:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
but not as an active membership
 
06:00:56.310 --> 06:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
what we would like to have put in the
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
place which is g
 
06:00:59.910 --> 06:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
would be in place of the plant growers
 
06:01:02.070 --> 06:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
association the new hampshire fruit
 
06:01:04.150 --> 06:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
growers association they are active
 
06:01:04.160 --> 06:01:05.670 align:start position:0%
growers association they are active
participants

06:01:05.670 --> 06:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
participants
 
06:01:07.830 --> 06:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
in this organization
 
06:01:09.590 --> 06:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
so that is the only
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
change that i would ask you to make and
 
06:01:11.760 --> 06:01:12.788 align:start position:0%
change that i would ask you to make and
i

06:01:12.788 --> 06:01:12.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
submit myself to
 
06:01:16.868 --> 06:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
to any questions or criticisms that you
 
06:01:18.230 --> 06:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
might have
 
06:01:20.390 --> 06:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh sean and of
 
06:01:20.400 --> 06:01:21.510 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh sean and of
course

06:01:21.510 --> 06:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
course
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
our first question always is
 
06:01:26.830 --> 06:01:26.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter over there
 
06:01:30.230 --> 06:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
hi are you actually calling on me
 
06:01:32.628 --> 06:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
i thought
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
yes i will i will ask you a question so
 
06:01:37.830 --> 06:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
is it usual that we have a non-profit
 
06:01:40.310 --> 06:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
that's also a commission that has
 
06:01:40.320 --> 06:01:41.670 align:start position:0%
that's also a commission that has
commissioners

06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
06:01:44.150 --> 06:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor is that a uh i
 
06:01:44.160 --> 06:01:45.190 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor is that a uh i
mean

06:01:45.190 --> 06:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:01:47.110 --> 06:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
it seems different to me than the other
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
commissions that i've known over been
 
06:01:50.390 --> 06:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
part of
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is different yes yes it is but
 
06:01:56.470 --> 06:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office did find
 
06:01:59.430 --> 06:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
another example to use so it's not this
 
06:02:02.070 --> 06:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
would not be the only such such thing so
 
06:02:02.080 --> 06:02:02.948 align:start position:0%
would not be the only such such thing so
they're

06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
they're
 
06:02:05.350 --> 06:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
a committee of of the state but they are
 
06:02:08.150 --> 06:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to operate um in this manner as
 
06:02:10.708 --> 06:02:10.718 align:start position:0%
an on a non-profit oh and i
 
06:02:12.628 --> 06:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean to mention one thing
 
06:02:14.548 --> 06:02:14.558 align:start position:0%
currently within the department of
 
06:02:16.470 --> 06:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
agriculture budget there is an
 
06:02:16.480 --> 06:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
agriculture budget there is an
appropriation

06:02:17.750 --> 06:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
06:02:17.760 --> 06:02:18.788 align:start position:0%
appropriation
i

06:02:18.788 --> 06:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
think it's at 15 or 16 000
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
a year
 
06:02:25.190 --> 06:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
to the ag in the classroom committee
 
06:02:27.430 --> 06:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
which was one of
 
06:02:29.670 --> 06:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
the issues that i had once i figured out
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
06:02:31.040 --> 06:02:32.230 align:start position:0%
that there was
um

06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:33.590 --> 06:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
there were these two separate
 
06:02:33.600 --> 06:02:35.350 align:start position:0%
there were these two separate
organizations

06:02:35.350 --> 06:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
06:02:37.910 --> 06:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
i felt technically i should be making
 
06:02:39.990 --> 06:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
the org the donation or the
 
06:02:41.830 --> 06:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the committee that
 
06:02:46.070 --> 06:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
actually wasn't functioning yet for
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
as long as our records show we've been
 
06:02:51.030 --> 06:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
making it to the other so that was part
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
of the issue as well
 
06:02:52.638 --> 06:02:53.830 align:start position:0%
of the issue as well
um

06:02:53.830 --> 06:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:55.110 --> 06:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
and so i said
 
06:02:57.430 --> 06:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
to them need to make this change and
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
probably if we can't make this happen
 
06:03:01.350 --> 06:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
then i probably shouldn't be supporting
 
06:03:03.670 --> 06:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
the active organization because i don't
 
06:03:06.868 --> 06:03:06.878 align:start position:0%
think that's legislative intent but
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
it's just been a mess and this seems to
 
06:03:11.110 --> 06:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
be the only way to straighten out the
 
06:03:14.470 --> 06:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
mess and accomplish everyone's goals
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
right so so it has funding and it also
 
06:03:20.070 --> 06:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
accepts donations correct and and does
 
06:03:21.750 --> 06:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
it have a budget and all that kind of
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
stuff it does and is that information
 
06:03:25.590 --> 06:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
all like online somewhere for us to see
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
um i don't know about
 
06:03:27.680 --> 06:03:28.470 align:start position:0%
um i don't know about
the

06:03:28.470 --> 06:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the budget i mean it
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
is public information but i don't think
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
that on the on the website and there is
 
06:03:36.310 --> 06:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
an ag in the classroom website
 
06:03:38.470 --> 06:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't think the budget information
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
is is is there
 
06:03:43.110 --> 06:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
but they do do filings so
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't looked into that that detail
 
06:03:47.830 --> 06:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly as a because i'm i'm a
 
06:03:49.350 --> 06:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
member of both
 
06:03:51.030 --> 06:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
both boards
 
06:03:55.510 --> 06:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:56.948 --> 06:03:56.958 align:start position:0%
represent tanner do you have your hand
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
up down there
 
06:03:59.510 --> 06:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
question i was wondering how the goal of
 
06:04:04.390 --> 06:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
this group and this committee
 
06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
is different from the unh extension
 
06:04:06.558 --> 06:04:08.628 align:start position:0%
is different from the unh extension
service

06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:04:08.638 --> 06:04:09.510 align:start position:0%
service
um

06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:11.590 --> 06:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
unh cooperative extension
 
06:04:17.110 --> 06:04:17.120 align:start position:0%
provides education
 
06:04:19.590 --> 06:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
to farmers really to people who are
 
06:04:19.600 --> 06:04:20.788 align:start position:0%
to farmers really to people who are
actively

06:04:20.788 --> 06:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
actively
 
06:04:22.948 --> 06:04:22.958 align:start position:0%
engaged in agriculture or to to
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners but the goal of this
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
organization is to get
 
06:04:26.958 --> 06:04:28.548 align:start position:0%
organization is to get
children

06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
children
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
interested and aware of what's going on
 
06:04:32.230 --> 06:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
in agriculture
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
um at a young age
 
06:04:34.240 --> 06:04:35.190 align:start position:0%
um at a young age
so

06:04:35.190 --> 06:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:04:37.510 --> 06:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
for instance there's the remick museum
 
06:04:39.590 --> 06:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
which is one of the places i went went
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
to with ag in the classroom and they
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
they do these tours i've also been um to
 
06:04:46.400 --> 06:04:47.990 align:start position:0%
they do these tours i've also been um to
deerfield

06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
deerfield
 
06:04:50.548 --> 06:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
where it wasn't an ag in the classroom
 
06:04:53.270 --> 06:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
per se but where they bring farm animals
 
06:04:55.030 --> 06:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
into the schools and the kids learn
 
06:04:57.030 --> 06:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
about them from from farmers so this is
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
strictly educational
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
06:05:02.390 --> 06:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
what farm animals are and what farming
 
06:05:05.430 --> 06:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
is about versus cooperative education
 
06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension which would teach
 
06:05:10.628 --> 06:05:10.638 align:start position:0%
about plant diseases and how to properly
 
06:05:12.628 --> 06:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
plant and help people with questions so
 
06:05:15.030 --> 06:05:15.040 align:start position:0%
there really are two different two
 
06:05:17.030 --> 06:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
totally different things
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
and hopefully you know the kids who get
 
06:05:21.990 --> 06:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
an interest here would be interested in
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
youth organizations such as 4-h and ffa
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
so it's really to to grab their
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
attention at a very young age because
 
06:05:31.670 --> 06:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
these are great school kids primarily
 
06:05:33.750 --> 06:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
although the charge goes beyond that but
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
with the limited resources
 
06:05:37.910 --> 06:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's more at a younger age represent
 
06:05:40.310 --> 06:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
woodcock did you have your hand up i did
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so much thank you
 
06:05:43.190 --> 06:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for taking my
 
06:05:46.708 --> 06:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
question uh and in line 17 but you don't
 
06:05:47.510 --> 06:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
you don't need to look i can tell you
 
06:05:49.270 --> 06:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
what it says it just says you have an
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
education director when funding allows
 
06:05:53.270 --> 06:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
is there currently an education director
 
06:05:54.788 --> 06:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
and what are the funding for that level
 
06:05:54.798 --> 06:05:55.750 align:start position:0%
and what are the funding for that level
um

06:05:55.750 --> 06:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
part-time yeah um i don't know what what
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
her salary is right now but it is a
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
part-time position okay that is funded
 
06:06:06.070 --> 06:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
through the monies coming in from
 
06:06:08.310 --> 06:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
the state because there are educational
 
06:06:08.320 --> 06:06:09.750 align:start position:0%
the state because there are educational
materials

06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
materials
 
06:06:09.760 --> 06:06:10.548 align:start position:0%
materials
that

06:06:10.548 --> 06:06:10.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:06:12.628 --> 06:06:12.638 align:start position:0%
we provide and there are things that the
 
06:06:15.590 --> 06:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee provides um
 
06:06:17.430 --> 06:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
but most of the money i think right now
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
that comes in
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
does go to
 
06:06:22.948 --> 06:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
support the one person who's who's
 
06:06:24.390 --> 06:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
getting paid there
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
to coordinate to set up the events and
 
06:06:29.030 --> 06:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay it is a lot of work to get these
 
06:06:30.868 --> 06:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
going on and obviously in the last
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
couple of years it's been uh difficult
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
to get districts to let
 
06:06:37.030 --> 06:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you secretary i
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't questioning the needed positions
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
yeah i was questioning would because it
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
sounds important uh but i was
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
questioning when it said when funding
 
06:06:45.270 --> 06:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
allowed i could see well about this year
 
06:06:47.030 --> 06:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
next year that was my only concern it's
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
been consistent and it has been one
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
one individual for a number of years as
 
06:06:53.430 --> 06:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
long as i can remember okay thank you
 
06:06:54.788 --> 06:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
very much that's perfect thank you very
 
06:06:56.788 --> 06:06:56.798 align:start position:0%
much thank you chairman i i notice on
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
page two of the bill
 
06:07:00.470 --> 06:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
a part o on line 11. any additional
 
06:07:05.430 --> 06:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
members appointed by the majority vote
 
06:07:06.788 --> 06:07:06.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee so the committee can
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
expand itself if he wants is that
 
06:07:11.590 --> 06:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
correct except to the degree
 
06:07:14.070 --> 06:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
that if you go to
 
06:07:14.080 --> 06:07:15.750 align:start position:0%
that if you go to
uh

06:07:15.750 --> 06:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:07:17.750 --> 06:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
where's the line it does say
 
06:07:20.788 --> 06:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
up to 20. so if you add up
 
06:07:22.390 --> 06:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
all of
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
all of the current authorized positions
 
06:07:27.190 --> 06:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
there are four who are by virtue of
 
06:07:27.200 --> 06:07:28.150 align:start position:0%
there are four who are by virtue of
office

06:07:28.150 --> 06:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
office
 
06:07:30.948 --> 06:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
and then an additional 10
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
from various organizations so that would
 
06:07:34.788 --> 06:07:34.798 align:start position:0%
only allow
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
six additional people to be to be
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
appointed by the committee you know i've
 
06:07:40.948 --> 06:07:40.958 align:start position:0%
sort of gone back and forth on that on
 
06:07:42.230 --> 06:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
06:07:44.390 --> 06:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the things people have said is
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
well why have the the committee not make
 
06:07:48.470 --> 06:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
the appointments
 
06:07:50.470 --> 06:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
i i find those relationships to be a
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
little bit incestuous
 
06:07:54.910 --> 06:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
being on a few where it's just
 
06:07:57.030 --> 06:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
self-perpetuating and there's not
 
06:07:59.110 --> 06:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
really a lot of opportunity for others
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
to come in so i think the process that
 
06:08:03.590 --> 06:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
we use where
 
06:08:05.750 --> 06:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
organizations make a nomination and the
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
governor looks at them
 
06:08:10.230 --> 06:08:10.240 align:start position:0%
works well and i think by having another
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
six that the committee could put on
 
06:08:13.830 --> 06:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
there are other people who may not
 
06:08:16.150 --> 06:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
represent any of these areas and we do
 
06:08:17.510 --> 06:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
have some now
 
06:08:19.190 --> 06:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
to allow the committee to put those on
 
06:08:20.470 --> 06:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
06:08:23.270 --> 06:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a minimum of you know 14 to
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
six so i think it strikes a good balance
 
06:08:28.868 --> 06:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
of of the concerns that others have had
 
06:08:30.948 --> 06:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
represent like us
 
06:08:32.948 --> 06:08:32.958 align:start position:0%
since this is something we really don't
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
know anything about
 
06:08:37.670 --> 06:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
can you give us a number of examples um
 
06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
of things that
 
06:08:39.440 --> 06:08:40.390 align:start position:0%
of things that
the

06:08:40.390 --> 06:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:08:42.390 --> 06:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
people are doing you know what kind of
 
06:08:45.510 --> 06:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
education etc so every year and and i
 
06:08:47.350 --> 06:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
think this is around the third or fourth
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
grade level and i that they primarily
 
06:08:51.830 --> 06:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
have been focusing on
 
06:08:54.708 --> 06:08:54.718 align:start position:0%
so there are books that we purchase
 
06:08:56.470 --> 06:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
for younger kids and they may be even
 
06:08:58.470 --> 06:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
younger younger than that to get out
 
06:09:00.788 --> 06:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
into the schools that are relative to
 
06:09:03.190 --> 06:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
about agriculture and they provide those
 
06:09:05.990 --> 06:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
books and other materials to to teachers
 
06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
who are willing to participate and
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't get everybody
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
participating but we work very hard
 
06:09:12.160 --> 06:09:12.948 align:start position:0%
participating but we work very hard
to

06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
and doe does take an active role in the
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
in the committee currently
 
06:09:20.708 --> 06:09:20.718 align:start position:0%
so get the informations out into the
 
06:09:20.718 --> 06:09:21.750 align:start position:0%
so get the informations out into the
schools

06:09:21.750 --> 06:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
06:09:23.990 --> 06:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
set up as many of these field trips as
 
06:09:25.030 --> 06:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
we can
 
06:09:27.430 --> 06:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
um close to various districts where they
 
06:09:30.470 --> 06:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
come in hopefully to active farms such
 
06:09:32.470 --> 06:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
as the remick museum or anybody else
 
06:09:34.788 --> 06:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
who's willing to host and get those kids
 
06:09:38.070 --> 06:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
there and um
 
06:09:39.190 --> 06:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
it really is about educating kids about
 
06:09:44.310 --> 06:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
ag that's cool thank you
 
06:09:45.750 --> 06:09:45.760 align:start position:0%

06:10:08.070 --> 06:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
be a not-for-profit voluntary

06:10:46.470 --> 06:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:48.390 --> 06:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
i still do yes
 
06:10:48.400 --> 06:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
i still do yes
um

06:10:49.510 --> 06:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:53.030 --> 06:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
so i didn't look into this terribly
 
06:10:54.788 --> 06:10:54.798 align:start position:0%
in depth because that didn't really
 
06:10:56.628 --> 06:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
matter to me the goal was what mattered
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
here not how they got there i trusted
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
the ag's office to do what needed to be
 
06:11:05.110 --> 06:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
done again the important part was to
 
06:11:05.120 --> 06:11:06.548 align:start position:0%
done again the important part was to
reconcile

06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
reconcile
 
06:11:10.070 --> 06:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that we have two separate
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
mirror organizations except that the one
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
that was established in 425.25
 
06:11:17.990 --> 06:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have the ability to function as
 
06:11:19.510 --> 06:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
a non-profit
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so the one that is already
 
06:11:23.110 --> 06:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
established long established as a
 
06:11:23.120 --> 06:11:25.110 align:start position:0%
established long established as a
non-profit

06:11:25.110 --> 06:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
non-profit
 
06:11:28.230 --> 06:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to continue in my my
 
06:11:28.240 --> 06:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to continue in my my
belief

06:11:29.350 --> 06:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
belief
 
06:11:31.190 --> 06:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
in order to get the state appropriation
 
06:11:32.788 --> 06:11:32.798 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
06:11:34.628 --> 06:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
be set up the way they even they
 
06:11:36.948 --> 06:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
intended again going back to the fact
 
06:11:38.628 --> 06:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
that they had the governor making all
 
06:11:40.310 --> 06:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
these appointments and the governors
 
06:11:43.430 --> 06:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
never made them so they weren't even
 
06:11:45.670 --> 06:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
following their own guidelines i went in
 
06:11:47.430 --> 06:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
one point and said okay there are only
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
two legal members of the committee
 
06:11:49.760 --> 06:11:50.788 align:start position:0%
two legal members of the committee
present

06:11:50.788 --> 06:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
present
 
06:11:50.798 --> 06:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
present
myself

06:11:52.310 --> 06:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:11:54.310 --> 06:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the representative of the department
 
06:11:56.150 --> 06:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
of education
 
06:11:57.990 --> 06:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
and so this brings that all together
 
06:12:00.788 --> 06:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
allows the function to continue
 
06:12:03.670 --> 06:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
in a unique way that i believe
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
serves everyone well but particularly
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
serves the children who we're trying to
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
reach in the appropriate manner
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
so this isn't something i dreamed up in
 
06:12:15.190 --> 06:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
terms of the language this is directly
 
06:12:17.190 --> 06:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
from the ag mr i actually have a
 
06:12:18.470 --> 06:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
question for you can we get somebody
 
06:12:20.470 --> 06:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
from the ag's in office in to explain
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
this because it's i don't know if any
 
06:12:23.830 --> 06:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
place else is state government we have a
 
06:12:26.150 --> 06:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
non-profit corporation and i'm trying to
 
06:12:26.160 --> 06:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
non-profit corporation and i'm trying to
understand

06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:12:29.270 --> 06:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
why we're expanding government into a
 
06:12:31.750 --> 06:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit corporation it just
 
06:12:35.270 --> 06:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
seems like a strange setup to me
 
06:12:36.868 --> 06:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
i don't know if jonathan would want to
 
06:12:40.230 --> 06:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
come up here or not you think
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh we could try they'd be great thank
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:48.230 --> 06:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
i i've got a question for you do you
 
06:12:52.230 --> 06:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:54.548 --> 06:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
um have you ever given any consideration
 
06:12:56.868 --> 06:12:56.878 align:start position:0%
to involving the state fair association
 
06:12:58.628 --> 06:12:58.638 align:start position:0%
seen they work with 4-h and all that
 
06:13:02.310 --> 06:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
other um and be a good way to integrate
 
06:13:04.948 --> 06:13:04.958 align:start position:0%
some of the purpose and responsibilities
 
06:13:08.070 --> 06:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
of this into grades three and four
 
06:13:09.190 --> 06:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
06:13:10.788 --> 06:13:10.798 align:start position:0%
given that any any thought
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
representative ladd um certainly not
 
06:13:15.430 --> 06:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
opposed to it it's been very difficult
 
06:13:16.708 --> 06:13:16.718 align:start position:0%
to get
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
people involved and you and i know very
 
06:13:20.868 --> 06:13:20.878 align:start position:0%
well on our on the bill that you
 
06:13:23.270 --> 06:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
sponsored we didn't even have anybody
 
06:13:25.590 --> 06:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
show up for that hearing um so i'm not
 
06:13:27.910 --> 06:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure how active the state fair
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
association is i am and
 
06:13:32.788 --> 06:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
you know unrelated to this i am working
 
06:13:34.948 --> 06:13:34.958 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if the
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh your bill uh makes it through the
 
06:13:39.110 --> 06:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
house next week and goes to a second
 
06:13:40.150 --> 06:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee that there will be
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
representatives from the state fair
 
06:13:43.670 --> 06:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
association but
 
06:13:43.680 --> 06:13:46.070 align:start position:0%
association but
um

06:13:46.070 --> 06:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:49.110 --> 06:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
it is difficult sometimes to get
 
06:13:51.430 --> 06:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
organizations involved in things outside
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
of their their scope
 
06:13:54.000 --> 06:13:54.868 align:start position:0%
of their their scope
so

06:13:54.868 --> 06:13:54.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good answer for you on
 
06:13:56.400 --> 06:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
i don't have a good answer for you on
that

06:13:57.350 --> 06:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:57.360 --> 06:13:58.788 align:start position:0%
that
representative

06:13:58.788 --> 06:13:58.798 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:14:00.788 --> 06:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks very much mr chair and
 
06:14:02.390 --> 06:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
sean it's great to see you good to see
 
06:14:03.670 --> 06:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
you so thanks for being with us this
 
06:14:03.680 --> 06:14:04.628 align:start position:0%
you so thanks for being with us this
afternoon

06:14:04.628 --> 06:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:14:07.670 --> 06:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
um when when when you were addressing um
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative walsh's um question about
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
why a um why
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
why essentially a government
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
based nonprofit as opposed to a 501 c 3
 
06:14:20.390 --> 06:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
type non-profit and i think i heard you
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
say so it could um it could it could
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
basically take state appropriations
 
06:14:28.628 --> 06:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
well yes i think because we could leave
 
06:14:29.990 --> 06:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
it alone and just
 
06:14:34.948 --> 06:14:34.958 align:start position:0%
eliminate rsa uh 425 25
 
06:14:37.350 --> 06:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
and then i suppose the appropriation
 
06:14:39.270 --> 06:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
could still be made
 
06:14:41.670 --> 06:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
to this organization they grew through
 
06:14:43.830 --> 06:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
like the farm bureau well
 
06:14:45.670 --> 06:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
currently um
 
06:14:45.680 --> 06:14:47.190 align:start position:0%
currently um
the

06:14:47.190 --> 06:14:47.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:14:49.910 --> 06:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
ffa receives a donation
 
06:14:53.670 --> 06:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
from from the state same amount of money
 
06:14:56.070 --> 06:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
so ag in the classroom and the ffa to
 
06:14:58.310 --> 06:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
their association get the same
 
06:15:00.548 --> 06:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
the same level of funding yeah
 
06:15:03.110 --> 06:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
but because this exists in rsa25 you
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
know 425 it didn't seem as though this
 
06:15:08.868 --> 06:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
approach the appropriation that has been
 
06:15:10.230 --> 06:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:15:13.990 --> 06:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the shadow organization that was really
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
proper sure
 
06:15:18.708 --> 06:15:18.718 align:start position:0%
and i do think because you know
 
06:15:20.548 --> 06:15:20.558 align:start position:0%
we should have
 
06:15:22.948 --> 06:15:22.958 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education and the
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
commissioner of agriculture on this
 
06:15:27.990 --> 06:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
again it would be
 
06:15:29.750 --> 06:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
do you how do you
 
06:15:31.670 --> 06:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
tell a non-profit
 
06:15:33.430 --> 06:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
that they're going to put certain people
 
06:15:35.190 --> 06:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
on their board
 
06:15:38.070 --> 06:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
and how does that happen and and i think
 
06:15:40.230 --> 06:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
the structure of who's on the board is
 
06:15:40.240 --> 06:15:41.350 align:start position:0%
the structure of who's on the board is
good

06:15:41.350 --> 06:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
good
 
06:15:43.510 --> 06:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
and i think the fact that it's not as i
 
06:15:45.670 --> 06:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
said incestuous
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
is good so i i i just i think it makes a
 
06:15:50.150 --> 06:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
lot of sense even though it may be a
 
06:15:51.830 --> 06:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
little bit different but it's
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
essentially how it's been
 
06:15:56.470 --> 06:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh organized just
 
06:15:56.480 --> 06:15:57.750 align:start position:0%
uh organized just
not

06:15:57.750 --> 06:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:15:59.910 --> 06:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
not in a way that really meets
 
06:16:02.070 --> 06:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
checks off all the boxes that it should
 
06:16:04.470 --> 06:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up on that not to hold you
 
06:16:06.390 --> 06:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
to the dollars and cents
 
06:16:08.868 --> 06:16:08.878 align:start position:0%
but um you know uh bigger than a bread
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
box smaller than an elephant um what do
 
06:16:15.110 --> 06:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
you do do you remember when and how much
 
06:16:17.430 --> 06:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
the last state appropriation was to this
 
06:16:17.440 --> 06:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
the last state appropriation was to this
program

06:16:18.390 --> 06:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:16:20.868 --> 06:16:20.878 align:start position:0%
i think it had been
 
06:16:23.430 --> 06:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
i think i'm i think we're at 15 000 this
 
06:16:26.948 --> 06:16:26.958 align:start position:0%
year going to 16 000 and i think it had
 
06:16:28.230 --> 06:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
been at
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
13 or 14 for a number of years there had
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
not been any increase in the
 
06:16:36.708 --> 06:16:36.718 align:start position:0%
appropriation for many so it's a very
 
06:16:39.110 --> 06:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
nominal statement appropriations yes
 
06:16:41.510 --> 06:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and um and then finally just a
 
06:16:42.868 --> 06:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
comment because we've had a whole day of
 
06:16:46.230 --> 06:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
these hearings uh the um the
 
06:16:47.510 --> 06:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:16:48.788 --> 06:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
committee certainly wouldn't be
 
06:16:50.948 --> 06:16:50.958 align:start position:0%
promoting things like organic farming or
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
discriminating against roundup and stuff
 
06:16:54.708 --> 06:16:54.718 align:start position:0%
like that no no the committee is
 
06:16:54.718 --> 06:16:56.788 align:start position:0%
like that no no the committee is
strictly

06:16:56.788 --> 06:16:56.798 align:start position:0%
strictly
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
it's not a question
 
06:17:02.470 --> 06:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee is truly just about educate
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
educating about what farming is really
 
06:17:06.548 --> 06:17:06.558 align:start position:0%
right no no
 
06:17:08.390 --> 06:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
and in all serious i come from uh from
 
06:17:10.150 --> 06:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
an agriculture from a far um an
 
06:17:13.110 --> 06:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
agricultural family that uh that that
 
06:17:15.670 --> 06:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
did do organic uh farming so thanks
 
06:17:18.708 --> 06:17:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:21.350 --> 06:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
representative porter mr chair thank you
 
06:17:23.430 --> 06:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
and you shocked me so much before you
 
06:17:25.670 --> 06:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
called on me that i lost the answer that
 
06:17:28.470 --> 06:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
you'd given me uh representative
 
06:17:29.990 --> 06:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
you started out by saying there were two
 
06:17:31.990 --> 06:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
shadows the two
 
06:17:34.310 --> 06:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
the other one was there was nobody on it
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
and it it was not functioning at all or
 
06:17:38.150 --> 06:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
did you join the church yeah no
 
06:17:41.110 --> 06:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
the one that was established under 42 25
 
06:17:41.120 --> 06:17:42.230 align:start position:0%
the one that was established under 42 25
25

06:17:42.230 --> 06:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
25
 
06:17:45.030 --> 06:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
was not functioning at all were there
 
06:17:46.470 --> 06:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
any members or anything no the governor
 
06:17:48.150 --> 06:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
had never made an appointment because
 
06:17:49.510 --> 06:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
apparently no commissioner of
 
06:17:51.670 --> 06:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture had ever asked him to and on
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
the other hand the the
 
06:17:57.190 --> 06:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
bylaws of the one that was functioning
 
06:18:00.230 --> 06:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
also called for the governor to make
 
06:18:01.750 --> 06:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
those appointments but you can't have a
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
private organization telling the
 
06:18:04.470 --> 06:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
governor what to do
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
and so what they had been doing was
 
06:18:08.548 --> 06:18:08.558 align:start position:0%
reaching out to members of those
 
06:18:08.558 --> 06:18:09.990 align:start position:0%
reaching out to members of those
organizations

06:18:09.990 --> 06:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
in most cases but not all
 
06:18:14.948 --> 06:18:14.958 align:start position:0%
and appointing somebody on their own
 
06:18:16.708 --> 06:18:16.718 align:start position:0%
so it was a violation of their own
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
bylaws but their own bylaws made no
 
06:18:20.548 --> 06:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
legal sense
 
06:18:20.558 --> 06:18:22.310 align:start position:0%
legal sense
so

06:18:22.310 --> 06:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:23.910 --> 06:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
i was scratching my head for a long
 
06:18:25.270 --> 06:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
while trying to figure out what i was
 
06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
going to do with this mess
 
06:18:28.160 --> 06:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
going to do with this mess
okay

06:18:29.510 --> 06:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:18:31.110 --> 06:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of the
 
06:18:31.120 --> 06:18:34.548 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions of the
commissioner

06:18:34.548 --> 06:18:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.430 --> 06:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:39.440 --> 06:18:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:18:40.390 --> 06:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much sean appreciate
 
06:18:59.750 --> 06:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:02.390 --> 06:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
hey so um i don't think there is there
 
06:19:04.708 --> 06:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on this particular
 
06:19:04.718 --> 06:19:06.150 align:start position:0%
any more discussion on this particular
bill

06:19:06.150 --> 06:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:19:07.750 --> 06:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's not an early bill so we have a
 
06:19:10.708 --> 06:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:10.718 --> 06:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
hermie

06:19:15.990 --> 06:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not here no we we'd
 
06:19:19.750 --> 06:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
have to we'd have to get them
 
06:19:21.750 --> 06:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
we got some time yeah and we
 
06:19:24.468 --> 06:19:24.478 align:start position:0%
across the street we'll have to yeah
 
06:19:24.478 --> 06:19:35.430 align:start position:0%
across the street we'll have to yeah
yeah

06:19:35.430 --> 06:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:36.948 --> 06:19:36.958 align:start position:0%
i'll get together with you then yeah i
 
06:19:40.230 --> 06:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
think there were
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
that'd be good
 
06:19:44.628 --> 06:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
okay so what we'll do is we'll stop this
 
06:19:46.310 --> 06:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
work session on this particular bill and
 
06:19:48.548 --> 06:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
then move over to the
 
06:19:52.468 --> 06:19:52.478 align:start position:0%
second bill which we had 1657
 
06:19:54.310 --> 06:19:54.320 align:start position:0%

and we have some technical support here
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%

06:21:39.920 --> 06:21:41.110 align:start position:0%
obviously you guys have looked at the
bill

06:21:41.110 --> 06:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:21:44.830 --> 06:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
um care to share some thoughts on
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
what what your impression is of the bill

thank you for the question
 
06:21:57.670 --> 06:21:57.680 align:start position:0%

happy to respond to technical requests
 
06:22:04.948 --> 06:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
from the committee we
 
06:22:06.948 --> 06:22:06.958 align:start position:0%
previously provided testimony on this
 
06:22:09.830 --> 06:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
bill related to the implementation
 
06:22:12.868 --> 06:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
considerations specifically for the new
 
06:22:15.190 --> 06:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of education and
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
school districts and implementing this
 
06:22:17.040 --> 06:22:19.750 align:start position:0%
school districts and implementing this
proposal

06:22:19.750 --> 06:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:20.948 --> 06:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
06:22:21.990 --> 06:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
with regards to the implementation of
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
the program could you remind us um what
 
06:22:28.798 --> 06:22:29.990 align:start position:0%
the program could you remind us um what
you

06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
shared with us when you were part of the
 
06:22:36.230 --> 06:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
full day of madness and uh
 
06:22:38.070 --> 06:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
sort of highlight
 
06:22:39.910 --> 06:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
if if you have concerns what those
 
06:22:44.310 --> 06:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:44.320 --> 06:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
sure

06:22:45.750 --> 06:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
so currently we have
 
06:22:50.708 --> 06:22:50.718 align:start position:0%
480 schools that are in the national
 
06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
school lunch program so all of those
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
schools would have the opportunity to
 
06:22:57.350 --> 06:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
provide in this program
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
and that would take an additional one to
 
06:22:59.200 --> 06:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
and that would take an additional one to
two

06:23:01.030 --> 06:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
06:23:04.310 --> 06:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
program assistance to implement on the
 
06:23:05.830 --> 06:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
back end of
 
06:23:05.840 --> 06:23:07.030 align:start position:0%
back end of
claiming

06:23:07.030 --> 06:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
claiming
 
06:23:10.468 --> 06:23:10.478 align:start position:0%
tech support anything along those lines
 
06:23:12.230 --> 06:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
as far as the state is concerned for
 
06:23:12.240 --> 06:23:17.270 align:start position:0%
as far as the state is concerned for
that

06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%

06:23:40.390 --> 06:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
reimbursable program so they serve
 
06:23:43.990 --> 06:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
the meals in this case it would be
 
06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
the food that's purchased and then it
 
06:23:47.910 --> 06:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
would be a reimbursable a reimbursement
 
06:23:50.070 --> 06:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
based off of the claims or the amount
 
06:23:53.910 --> 06:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:55.510 --> 06:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
is there a maximum limit to that i know
 
06:23:57.750 --> 06:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
you have x amount in the budget is there
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
maximum limit for reimbursement so it's
 
06:24:02.788 --> 06:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
not it's not pre-approved
 
06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
as for this bill it's stated here that
 
06:24:07.110 --> 06:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
it will cover twelve hundred dollars
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
total okay thank you thank you chairman
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
there is reimbursement uh based on
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
whether you're in tier one
 
06:24:16.788 --> 06:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
or tier two thirty three percent sixteen
 
06:24:16.798 --> 06:24:17.990 align:start position:0%
or tier two thirty three percent sixteen
percent

06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:24:18.000 --> 06:24:19.270 align:start position:0%
percent
um

06:24:19.270 --> 06:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
does the rim is the reimbursement
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
contingent upon usda approval
 
06:24:26.868 --> 06:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
are they involved with this or we just
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
go to any farm or any you know and just
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
bring that stuff into the schools and
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
you get us you know reimbursed for the
 
06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
cost at 33 or 16 percent
 
06:24:39.590 --> 06:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
as it states in this bill proposed that
 
06:24:41.510 --> 06:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
this would be state
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
state funded so the usda would not have
 
06:24:43.600 --> 06:24:44.310 align:start position:0%
state funded so the usda would not have
a

06:24:44.310 --> 06:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:24:46.948 --> 06:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
um a point to to say in that so those
 
06:24:48.948 --> 06:24:48.958 align:start position:0%
logistics would need to be figured out
 
06:24:51.910 --> 06:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
as far as tier one or tier two um i know
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of specifics in
 
06:24:54.948 --> 06:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
here on tier one or tier two but there
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be a lot more
 
06:24:57.990 --> 06:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
in-depth conversations that would need
 
06:25:00.150 --> 06:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
to be had on that topic
 
06:25:01.590 --> 06:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
and can you explain tier one a little
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
bit better to me um tier one being our
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
state tier two being outside in the
 
06:25:08.548 --> 06:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
periphery states around us their
 
06:25:11.910 --> 06:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
contingent to us or abutting us
 
06:25:13.590 --> 06:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
is a product
 
06:25:16.628 --> 06:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
that's being produced in tier 1
 
06:25:16.638 --> 06:25:19.110 align:start position:0%
that's being produced in tier 1
territory

06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
territory
 
06:25:21.350 --> 06:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
but owned by
 
06:25:22.868 --> 06:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
tier 2
 
06:25:22.878 --> 06:25:25.270 align:start position:0%
tier 2
company

06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
company
 
06:25:26.788 --> 06:25:26.798 align:start position:0%
what kind of break are they going to get
 
06:25:28.390 --> 06:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
are they going to get the tier 2 break
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
or the tier 1 break for reimbursement in
 
06:25:32.230 --> 06:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
06:25:32.240 --> 06:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
the schools
so

06:25:33.990 --> 06:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:36.788 --> 06:25:36.798 align:start position:0%
the legislation specifically uh
 
06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
requests that the new hampshire
 
06:25:39.910 --> 06:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
department of education the state board
 
06:25:42.230 --> 06:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
of education promulgate rules on
 
06:25:46.150 --> 06:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
providers and specific eligible foods so
 
06:25:47.590 --> 06:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would likely be a technical
 
06:25:49.590 --> 06:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
question that needed to be borne out in
 
06:25:51.670 --> 06:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
those rules
 
06:25:51.680 --> 06:25:52.390 align:start position:0%
those rules
so

06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:25:54.868 --> 06:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
my pop so it's not defined in this
 
06:25:57.510 --> 06:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
06:26:00.070 --> 06:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
a specific question where a
 
06:26:01.750 --> 06:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
farm might be located in the state of
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but was owned by a company
 
06:26:08.548 --> 06:26:08.558 align:start position:0%
in a tier two state no that specific
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
question is not conceived of in the
 
06:26:12.310 --> 06:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislation and likely would be
 
06:26:13.590 --> 06:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
something that we would need to rule
 
06:26:14.708 --> 06:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
make on
 
06:26:17.350 --> 06:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
and i'll just one last one here so
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
milk that's and i'm talking about my
 
06:26:21.830 --> 06:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
community hatchling dairy is unto
 
06:26:21.840 --> 06:26:23.350 align:start position:0%
community hatchling dairy is unto
haverhill

06:26:23.350 --> 06:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
haverhill
 
06:26:25.190 --> 06:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
everything's you know
 
06:26:26.468 --> 06:26:26.478 align:start position:0%
fed there
 
06:26:27.750 --> 06:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
born there
 
06:26:31.030 --> 06:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
packaged there and sold from there
 
06:26:33.190 --> 06:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
but then we have other products which
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
are new hampshire products that are
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
leaving our state in agrimark or
 
06:26:38.788 --> 06:26:38.798 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and they're leaving for
 
06:26:40.070 --> 06:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know being put together and
 
06:26:43.350 --> 06:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
everything outside our state
 
06:26:43.360 --> 06:26:44.230 align:start position:0%
everything outside our state
that's

06:26:44.230 --> 06:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
that's
 
06:26:46.150 --> 06:26:46.160 align:start position:0%
so whether that's tier one or tier two
 
06:26:47.830 --> 06:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's not defined in this bill it's
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
something you'd have to do through rules
 
06:26:52.628 --> 06:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
is that how i understand that
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes that specific scenario in which um
 
06:26:57.590 --> 06:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
there it could be classified as either
 
06:26:59.990 --> 06:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
tier one or tier two uh based on
 
06:27:01.990 --> 06:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
production versus ownership would be a
 
06:27:03.110 --> 06:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
question that we would need to address
 
06:27:04.150 --> 06:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
in roles
 
06:27:04.160 --> 06:27:07.270 align:start position:0%
in roles
okay

06:27:07.270 --> 06:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:09.670 --> 06:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
represent boom
 
06:27:11.190 --> 06:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
06:27:13.110 --> 06:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
coming i um
 
06:27:16.788 --> 06:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
can't school districts now contract with
 
06:27:22.390 --> 06:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:24.390 --> 06:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
yes they absolutely can and there's some
 
06:27:30.230 --> 06:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:32.788 --> 06:27:32.798 align:start position:0%
and then sorry to to further clarify
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
your prior question chairman lad it
 
06:27:36.390 --> 06:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
specifically indicates
 
06:27:36.400 --> 06:27:37.190 align:start position:0%
specifically indicates
the

06:27:37.190 --> 06:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
place of origin of the food
 
06:27:42.310 --> 06:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
but we would have to develop processes
 
06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
and procedures for the self-attestation
 
06:27:49.270 --> 06:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
of the producer for the place of origin
 
06:27:51.670 --> 06:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
so we we would expect in the development
 
06:27:54.150 --> 06:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
of those processes and procedures uh
 
06:27:55.670 --> 06:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not the interpretation was
 
06:27:57.910 --> 06:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
significant enough to require rule
 
06:27:59.590 --> 06:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
making or could be accomplished in
 
06:28:01.190 --> 06:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
guidance and technical assistance would
 
06:28:03.590 --> 06:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
be something we would have to get into
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the weeds of implementation
 
06:28:08.788 --> 06:28:08.798 align:start position:0%
yes i'd be concerned about the raw
 
06:28:10.708 --> 06:28:10.718 align:start position:0%
material that came come from the state
 
06:28:12.230 --> 06:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
but it goes over there it's packaged in
 
06:28:13.750 --> 06:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
the form of a food
 
06:28:15.750 --> 06:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
with a lot of other products blended in
 
06:28:18.468 --> 06:28:18.478 align:start position:0%
with it
 
06:28:19.830 --> 06:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
and that and that raises another
 
06:28:21.510 --> 06:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
important question that
 
06:28:22.708 --> 06:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
many of our
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
food service programs and schools do not
 
06:28:26.708 --> 06:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
work with raw materials at this time or
 
06:28:28.868 --> 06:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
do not work with raw materials
 
06:28:30.788 --> 06:28:30.798 align:start position:0%
to a significant degree so that would
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
also require significant training for
 
06:28:35.670 --> 06:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
the food service providers and
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
significant additional time on meal
 
06:28:41.350 --> 06:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
preparation and we noted that in the
 
06:28:43.350 --> 06:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
local expenditures but again those costs
 
06:28:46.788 --> 06:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
were indeterminable by the agency
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
represent luna thanks very much mr chair
 
06:28:51.990 --> 06:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
thanks very much for your technical um
 
06:28:53.830 --> 06:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh support this afternoon
 
06:28:57.590 --> 06:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
um so um so following on um chair ladd's
 
06:29:00.868 --> 06:29:00.878 align:start position:0%
questions with respect to um
 
06:29:03.350 --> 06:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
the clarity in the bill and rulemaking
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
under 541a
 
06:29:07.350 --> 06:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
um uh do you
 
06:29:09.030 --> 06:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
would it be reasonable
 
06:29:11.910 --> 06:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
to uh to make certain rules as like the
 
06:29:15.270 --> 06:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
ones you've you've discussed um
 
06:29:18.310 --> 06:29:18.320 align:start position:0%
under 541a without having it spelled out
 
06:29:20.070 --> 06:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
in black and white in the bill
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
and um and would it also be uh be
 
06:29:23.280 --> 06:29:24.390 align:start position:0%
and um and would it also be uh be
possible

06:29:24.390 --> 06:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:29:26.628 --> 06:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
for the um
 
06:29:29.910 --> 06:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
for the department to generate a list of
 
06:29:33.430 --> 06:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
approved suppliers so that food service
 
06:29:33.440 --> 06:29:34.628 align:start position:0%
approved suppliers so that food service
directors

06:29:34.628 --> 06:29:34.638 align:start position:0%
directors
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
in these schools don't need to
 
06:29:41.270 --> 06:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:43.590 --> 06:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate tier one or tier two
 
06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
supplier but can actually sort of uh
 
06:29:48.548 --> 06:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
pick through the list make it easy from
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
the department
 
06:29:52.628 --> 06:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
and um and uh uh
 
06:29:54.708 --> 06:29:54.718 align:start position:0%
seek out those uh those products from
 
06:29:57.990 --> 06:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
those suppliers and then seek
 
06:29:58.000 --> 06:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
those suppliers and then seek
the

06:29:59.110 --> 06:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:30:01.030 --> 06:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
percentage reimbursement of the cost
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i think
 
06:30:07.350 --> 06:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps our greatest concern around rule
 
06:30:09.590 --> 06:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
making on the specifications and
 
06:30:12.230 --> 06:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications of eligible food and then
 
06:30:12.240 --> 06:30:13.190 align:start position:0%
qualifications of eligible food and then
uh

06:30:13.190 --> 06:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
creating a list of pre-approved
 
06:30:16.788 --> 06:30:16.798 align:start position:0%
providers would be that we don't have
 
06:30:20.310 --> 06:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
the current in-house expertise to do so
 
06:30:22.468 --> 06:30:22.478 align:start position:0%
and that's again why we made it explicit
 
06:30:23.590 --> 06:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
that we would need
 
06:30:25.430 --> 06:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
an additional two new program
 
06:30:28.390 --> 06:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
specialists likely to uh implement a
 
06:30:31.190 --> 06:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
program similar to the size of the
 
06:30:32.868 --> 06:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program on which
 
06:30:35.030 --> 06:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have about three sometimes four staff
 
06:30:35.040 --> 06:30:36.548 align:start position:0%
we have about three sometimes four staff
working

06:30:36.548 --> 06:30:36.558 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:30:39.030 --> 06:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
on that yes so thanks so
 
06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know in in in some ways i don't see
 
06:30:41.040 --> 06:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
you know in in in some ways i don't see
this

06:30:41.830 --> 06:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:30:44.310 --> 06:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
all that different from a uh
 
06:30:46.708 --> 06:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
from from the department standpoint with
 
06:30:48.390 --> 06:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the let's say the learn everywhere
 
06:30:50.868 --> 06:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
program where the department was vetting
 
06:30:53.510 --> 06:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
and put compiling a list of
 
06:30:56.390 --> 06:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
of service providers for that did did
 
06:30:58.788 --> 06:30:58.798 align:start position:0%
putting that list together require how
 
06:31:01.510 --> 06:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
many additional staff did that require
 
06:31:03.030 --> 06:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
from the department
 
06:31:04.468 --> 06:31:04.478 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:31:06.230 --> 06:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
that program is currently implemented
 
06:31:08.390 --> 06:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
with existing staff but that has been an
 
06:31:09.830 --> 06:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
exploration around
 
06:31:12.548 --> 06:31:12.558 align:start position:0%
additional staff capacity but we do have
 
06:31:15.270 --> 06:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
the in-house capacity to
 
06:31:15.280 --> 06:31:16.390 align:start position:0%
the in-house capacity to
vet

06:31:16.390 --> 06:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
vet
 
06:31:18.868 --> 06:31:18.878 align:start position:0%
education service providers we are the
 
06:31:20.868 --> 06:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
department of education we do not have
 
06:31:24.150 --> 06:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
the in-house capacity to vet food
 
06:31:26.788 --> 06:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
service providers and vendors
 
06:31:28.548 --> 06:31:28.558 align:start position:0%
and that would likely be expertise that
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
we would need to develop
 
06:31:32.708 --> 06:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
follow up on that because i want to make
 
06:31:35.190 --> 06:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
it really clear that that i understand
 
06:31:36.708 --> 06:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
that you're the department of it with
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
the department of education but a lot of
 
06:31:41.750 --> 06:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
the learn everywhere providers are not
 
06:31:44.070 --> 06:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
schools their businesses
 
06:31:46.948 --> 06:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
their their manufacturing facilities
 
06:31:49.510 --> 06:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
their sports complexes there are a lot
 
06:31:51.190 --> 06:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
of things that are outside of what i
 
06:31:54.708 --> 06:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
would call the the school environment so
 
06:31:56.708 --> 06:31:56.718 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
06:31:59.030 --> 06:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
how did the department develop the
 
06:32:03.110 --> 06:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
expertise to work with um or to real
 
06:32:05.350 --> 06:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
understand and be able to vet
 
06:32:08.628 --> 06:32:08.638 align:start position:0%
um an educational curriculum when it uh
 
06:32:10.628 --> 06:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
when it when it's being delivered
 
06:32:13.670 --> 06:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
through uh through non-um
 
06:32:15.750 --> 06:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know through through a manufacturer
 
06:32:18.628 --> 06:32:18.638 align:start position:0%
and engineering company or sports um
 
06:32:18.638 --> 06:32:20.708 align:start position:0%
and engineering company or sports um
complex

06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
complex
 
06:32:22.788 --> 06:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so uh and i
 
06:32:22.798 --> 06:32:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so uh and i
was

06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:32:25.750 --> 06:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
again stated that it was related to the
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
approval of education service providers
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
we all know that education does not only
 
06:32:32.548 --> 06:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
happen in a classroom setting so the
 
06:32:35.190 --> 06:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a multitude of different
 
06:32:37.270 --> 06:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
types of educational environments was
 
06:32:43.190 --> 06:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:44.390 --> 06:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
represent woodcock
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
thank you chairmanlet um
 
06:32:48.390 --> 06:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
i have another question
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
06:32:54.628 --> 06:32:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:57.270 --> 06:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
in the school district of for example in
 
06:32:58.548 --> 06:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
a scenario of
 
06:33:00.468 --> 06:33:00.478 align:start position:0%
five schools
 
06:33:02.070 --> 06:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
under that i'm trying to read school and
 
06:33:05.670 --> 06:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
school districts is each is each school
 
06:33:07.590 --> 06:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
within that school district
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for a maximum with 1200 dollars
 
06:33:13.750 --> 06:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:16.390 --> 06:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
it specifically states school per school
 
06:33:18.230 --> 06:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
per year but that raises an important
 
06:33:20.230 --> 06:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
question because we do see throughout
 
06:33:22.948 --> 06:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
the proposal the term sau school
 
06:33:25.750 --> 06:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
district or lea and school potentially
 
06:33:27.990 --> 06:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
used interchangeably so we would seek
 
06:33:30.390 --> 06:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
additional clarification on the intent
 
06:33:32.390 --> 06:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
could you repeat the last sentence
 
06:33:33.750 --> 06:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
so we would seek additional
 
06:33:35.990 --> 06:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on the intent of whether
 
06:33:38.548 --> 06:33:38.558 align:start position:0%
sau was meant school district or lea was
 
06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
meant or school was meant okay thank you
 
06:33:43.110 --> 06:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
very much chairman you're welcome uh
 
06:33:45.350 --> 06:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
mackenzie i note that there is a six
 
06:33:47.350 --> 06:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar appropriation in
 
06:33:49.510 --> 06:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
fy 23 for this
 
06:33:49.520 --> 06:33:51.510 align:start position:0%
fy 23 for this

06:33:51.510 --> 06:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:33:53.350 --> 06:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
if i were to ask the department and i've
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
done it several years back with the
 
06:33:57.510 --> 06:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
prior commissioner
 
06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
is this a priority of the department
 
06:34:02.708 --> 06:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
06:34:04.628 --> 06:34:04.638 align:start position:0%
nurse coordinator positions we're
 
06:34:06.468 --> 06:34:06.478 align:start position:0%
looking position we're looking at
 
06:34:08.868 --> 06:34:08.878 align:start position:0%
various folks expanding curriculum maybe
 
06:34:10.788 --> 06:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
with personal finance literacy that
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
means more training and
 
06:34:15.030 --> 06:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
support people there
 
06:34:18.070 --> 06:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
is would this if stacked up against all
 
06:34:20.230 --> 06:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
the other requests and your priorities
 
06:34:22.628 --> 06:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
over there where would this stack up in
 
06:34:24.788 --> 06:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
terms of appropriating additional
 
06:34:26.390 --> 06:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
dollars for comfort
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
be placed on that priority scale
 
06:34:31.030 --> 06:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
06:34:32.788 --> 06:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
whatever the legislature enacts is a
 
06:34:35.190 --> 06:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
priority for the agency to administer
 
06:34:36.948 --> 06:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
you're very good at that that's the same
 
06:34:39.270 --> 06:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
answer i used to get from uh virginia
 
06:34:42.150 --> 06:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
berry and you know we could never get uh
 
06:34:45.590 --> 06:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
defined answers what is the priority
 
06:34:47.510 --> 06:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
yet we come up with some legislation
 
06:34:49.510 --> 06:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
like a nurse coordinator position or
 
06:34:50.948 --> 06:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be
 
06:34:53.350 --> 06:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
or a counselor position and on it goes
 
06:34:55.990 --> 06:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
down the list
 
06:34:57.590 --> 06:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
and well i'm not going to go there we
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't have a voucher program we have an
 
06:35:02.310 --> 06:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
efa program it's not a voucher at any
 
06:35:05.750 --> 06:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
rate so i i i think it's incumbent upon
 
06:35:07.990 --> 06:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
the department to start you know tone up
 
06:35:09.190 --> 06:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the line here and give us some
 
06:35:11.350 --> 06:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
priorities so what you see as you need
 
06:35:13.270 --> 06:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
over there whether it's a new system to
 
06:35:15.110 --> 06:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
run your budgets with or
 
06:35:18.548 --> 06:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
or technology what have you um you know
 
06:35:20.548 --> 06:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
we can take our shots
 
06:35:22.628 --> 06:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
but you know is that the wisest way to
 
06:35:26.070 --> 06:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
spend money i don't think so
 
06:35:27.830 --> 06:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the guidance i can state
 
06:35:29.190 --> 06:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:35:30.548 --> 06:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
we are here to provide technical
 
06:35:32.310 --> 06:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
assistance to my knowledge we were not
 
06:35:34.868 --> 06:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
actively involved in the drafting of
 
06:35:37.510 --> 06:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
this proposal um so so that would
 
06:35:39.270 --> 06:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
provide an indication to the extent to
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
which it was
 
06:35:43.030 --> 06:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
between the lines thanks
 
06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
representative tanner
 
06:35:48.230 --> 06:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um out of the 480 schools in
 
06:35:49.990 --> 06:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
the lunch program how many are charter
 
06:35:50.000 --> 06:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
the lunch program how many are charter
schools

06:35:53.430 --> 06:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.440 --> 06:35:54.750 align:start position:0%
 
there's

06:35:54.750 --> 06:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:35:58.310 --> 06:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
137 i believe charter schools in in that
 
06:36:00.788 --> 06:36:00.798 align:start position:0%
but i can get you a a definite number
 
06:36:03.590 --> 06:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that have a a lunch
 
06:36:03.600 --> 06:36:04.910 align:start position:0%
so that's that's that have a a lunch
program

06:36:04.910 --> 06:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:36:07.430 --> 06:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
137 out of the 480.
 
06:36:09.670 --> 06:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
yes but i can get you a definite um
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
number on that okay and are there
 
06:36:14.310 --> 06:36:14.320 align:start position:0%
other private schools academies or
 
06:36:15.910 --> 06:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
06:36:17.590 --> 06:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we're now sending students to that
 
06:36:21.670 --> 06:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:23.910 --> 06:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
um yes and i can get you that number as
 
06:36:23.920 --> 06:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
um yes and i can get you that number as
well

06:36:25.030 --> 06:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:36:27.270 --> 06:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
and and they're getting reimbursed
 
06:36:29.270 --> 06:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
through the um
 
06:36:30.868 --> 06:36:30.878 align:start position:0%
through the lunch program
 
06:36:34.948 --> 06:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
yes we do have some schools that um
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
participate through other through an siu
 
06:36:40.708 --> 06:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
and get food through that program yes
 
06:36:43.350 --> 06:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative mullen
 
06:36:47.750 --> 06:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
i just can't stay off of this topic mr
 
06:36:49.350 --> 06:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
06:36:49.360 --> 06:36:51.270 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
um

06:36:51.270 --> 06:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:53.510 --> 06:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
when you read the bill uh
 
06:36:53.520 --> 06:36:54.708 align:start position:0%
when you read the bill uh
mackenzie

06:36:54.708 --> 06:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
mackenzie
 
06:36:57.830 --> 06:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
you read it as a voluntary thing that
 
06:37:00.708 --> 06:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
schools would opt in or
 
06:37:02.708 --> 06:37:02.718 align:start position:0%
opt-in and then ultimately would have
 
06:37:05.430 --> 06:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
the freedom to opt out if they chose to
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
at any point in time am i correct in
 
06:37:07.680 --> 06:37:09.270 align:start position:0%
at any point in time am i correct in
that

06:37:09.270 --> 06:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:37:11.670 --> 06:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
yes we do not interpret the legislative
 
06:37:14.628 --> 06:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
proposal to require participation um and
 
06:37:16.468 --> 06:37:16.478 align:start position:0%
it's only eligible for those schools
 
06:37:20.310 --> 06:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
participating within us in slp currently
 
06:37:22.628 --> 06:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick follow-up um
 
06:37:24.708 --> 06:37:24.718 align:start position:0%
yeah because we we've gotten
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
a tremendous amount of email from
 
06:37:30.708 --> 06:37:30.718 align:start position:0%
various communities that have
 
06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
farmers farmers markets whatever in
 
06:37:35.110 --> 06:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
support of this
 
06:37:38.070 --> 06:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
so um would you believe that the bill's
 
06:37:39.830 --> 06:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
author is sitting behind you in the
 
06:37:42.788 --> 06:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
audience and if you should in fact need
 
06:37:42.798 --> 06:37:43.910 align:start position:0%
audience and if you should in fact need
any

06:37:43.910 --> 06:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:37:46.708 --> 06:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
follow-up information or to discuss any
 
06:37:49.030 --> 06:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
language i'm sure she would be willing
 
06:37:53.670 --> 06:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:55.270 --> 06:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
when do you think you can get this going
 
06:37:59.670 --> 06:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date is july 1 2022.
 
06:38:01.670 --> 06:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that's another piece of significant
 
06:38:03.990 --> 06:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
technical assistance we had previously
 
06:38:04.000 --> 06:38:04.948 align:start position:0%
technical assistance we had previously
shared

06:38:04.948 --> 06:38:04.958 align:start position:0%
shared
 
06:38:09.030 --> 06:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
it takes significant time to
 
06:38:11.590 --> 06:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
have the supply side respond to this to
 
06:38:14.150 --> 06:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
identify eligible vendors
 
06:38:16.948 --> 06:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
to learn how to process raw foods
 
06:38:18.548 --> 06:38:18.558 align:start position:0%
so we do not believe that we could
 
06:38:20.948 --> 06:38:20.958 align:start position:0%
successfully implement this bill
 
06:38:27.910 --> 06:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:29.830 --> 06:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
okay so are you saying that the date
 
06:38:32.548 --> 06:38:32.558 align:start position:0%
needs to be pushed out further
 
06:38:34.868 --> 06:38:34.878 align:start position:0%
do you what do you think like another
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
fiscal year beyond that or july 1 2023
 
06:38:44.628 --> 06:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
or january 1 2023 july 1 2020 24
 
06:38:47.190 --> 06:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
or whatever
 
06:38:49.350 --> 06:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
i think to effectively implement this
 
06:38:52.070 --> 06:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
program to its full capability should be
 
06:38:54.468 --> 06:38:54.478 align:start position:0%
at least until july
 
06:39:02.070 --> 06:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
uh are there other questions from the
 
06:39:07.350 --> 06:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:11.110 --> 06:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's going on four o'clock almost here
 
06:39:13.590 --> 06:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
big question to you yeah so on the uh
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
the two bills that that we've just
 
06:39:17.670 --> 06:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
discussed in the in the full committee
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
work session
 
06:39:22.310 --> 06:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
um we looking to push off the execs on
 
06:39:22.320 --> 06:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
um we looking to push off the execs on
those

06:39:23.270 --> 06:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
06:39:27.350 --> 06:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
certainly the first one 1164 pending doj
 
06:39:30.310 --> 06:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
well 1657 can't be pushed off that's an
 
06:39:33.030 --> 06:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
early bill right all right so 1164 we'd
 
06:39:35.270 --> 06:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
push that that could be pushed that's
 
06:39:35.280 --> 06:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
push that that could be pushed that's
right

06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:38.000 --> 06:39:38.670 align:start position:0%
 
but

06:39:38.670 --> 06:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:39:40.868 --> 06:39:40.878 align:start position:0%
1657 we will be
 
06:39:42.788 --> 06:39:42.798 align:start position:0%
probably addressing tomorrow right and
 
06:39:45.190 --> 06:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
so that that goes where after this
 
06:39:49.590 --> 06:39:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:51.270 --> 06:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know we have a prior speaker
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
here maybe he could tell us where his
 
06:39:54.628 --> 06:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
guess is that a bill like this would go
 
06:39:54.638 --> 06:39:55.670 align:start position:0%
guess is that a bill like this would go
to

06:39:55.670 --> 06:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:39:59.910 --> 06:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:02.230 --> 06:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
appropriating the money from where
 
06:40:04.548 --> 06:40:04.558 align:start position:0%
well but ways and means or finance i
 
06:40:05.910 --> 06:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
06:40:07.910 --> 06:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
well finance appropriates probably
 
06:40:07.920 --> 06:40:09.350 align:start position:0%
well finance appropriates probably
finance

06:40:09.350 --> 06:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
finance
 
06:40:11.030 --> 06:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
ways to meet where you're going to get
 
06:40:13.910 --> 06:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:15.670 --> 06:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
well that's a fine that's a
 
06:40:17.510 --> 06:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
mary beth do you can you weigh in on
 
06:40:39.510 --> 06:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:12.070 --> 06:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:15.590 --> 06:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like it's a long shot
 
06:41:15.600 --> 06:41:16.628 align:start position:0%
yeah it sounds like it's a long shot
yeah

06:41:16.628 --> 06:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:41:18.868 --> 06:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
06:41:21.270 --> 06:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you very much are there
 
06:41:24.468 --> 06:41:24.478 align:start position:0%
any more questions for the department
 
06:41:28.310 --> 06:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
sean do you have anything else to add to
 
06:41:36.788 --> 06:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:43.750 --> 06:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:45.510 --> 06:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you'd think you'd think by now i
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
would have learned sometimes it's best
 
06:41:48.708 --> 06:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
to keep my mouth shut but
 
06:41:51.270 --> 06:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
um i do want to just speak to some of
 
06:41:51.280 --> 06:41:52.150 align:start position:0%
um i do want to just speak to some of
the

06:41:52.150 --> 06:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:41:55.590 --> 06:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
the practicality or lack thereof of what
 
06:41:57.910 --> 06:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm seeing here
 
06:41:57.920 --> 06:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm seeing here
um

06:41:59.270 --> 06:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:02.468 --> 06:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
i think there are very few commodities
 
06:42:04.868 --> 06:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire farmers could provide
 
06:42:07.590 --> 06:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
consistently for school districts
 
06:42:10.070 --> 06:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
during the year i think you have to to
 
06:42:10.080 --> 06:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
during the year i think you have to to
realize

06:42:11.190 --> 06:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
realize
 
06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
that because of the the low amount of
 
06:42:15.510 --> 06:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
money that's being appropriated here per
 
06:42:17.030 --> 06:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
school district
 
06:42:20.708 --> 06:42:20.718 align:start position:0%
if school districts were expected to
 
06:42:22.468 --> 06:42:22.478 align:start position:0%
set up
 
06:42:22.478 --> 06:42:23.750 align:start position:0%
set up
purchasing

06:42:23.750 --> 06:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
06:42:27.430 --> 06:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
for some commodities for a partial
 
06:42:27.440 --> 06:42:28.468 align:start position:0%
for some commodities for a partial
year

06:42:28.468 --> 06:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
year
 
06:42:30.230 --> 06:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
and have to go someplace else you're
 
06:42:32.390 --> 06:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
probably not going to have
 
06:42:34.390 --> 06:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of participation
 
06:42:36.628 --> 06:42:36.638 align:start position:0%
milk is probably the only thing that a
 
06:42:36.638 --> 06:42:40.310 align:start position:0%
milk is probably the only thing that a
few

06:42:40.310 --> 06:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:42.628 --> 06:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
farms could supply consistently
 
06:42:44.150 --> 06:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the year and i
 
06:42:47.270 --> 06:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know i think the idea is nice for
 
06:42:49.110 --> 06:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire farmers
 
06:42:50.548 --> 06:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
um i would
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
suspect for something like this to work
 
06:42:54.708 --> 06:42:54.718 align:start position:0%
because this is so broad and twelve
 
06:42:56.788 --> 06:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars is so little i can tell
 
06:42:59.270 --> 06:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
you in hudson which is probably the
 
06:43:01.430 --> 06:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
ninth or tenth largest district in the
 
06:43:03.830 --> 06:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
state there are seven schools
 
06:43:05.590 --> 06:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's seventy two hundred dollars a
 
06:43:08.150 --> 06:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
year i can't believe for a moment that
 
06:43:11.350 --> 06:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
the school district would put the time
 
06:43:14.468 --> 06:43:14.478 align:start position:0%
um into this that it would take to
 
06:43:15.910 --> 06:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
implement it for seventy two hundred
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that something like this i think
 
06:43:20.310 --> 06:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
there would need to be a pilot program
 
06:43:21.590 --> 06:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
you would need
 
06:43:24.468 --> 06:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
a school district that was willing
 
06:43:25.990 --> 06:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
06:43:28.628 --> 06:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
and see if it was practical and how how
 
06:43:29.750 --> 06:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
many people
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
could participate in the state because i
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
think you spread this out to where it's
 
06:43:36.070 --> 06:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
like three dollars a student
 
06:43:38.230 --> 06:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
spread out all over the state i think is
 
06:43:40.708 --> 06:43:40.718 align:start position:0%
a practical matter for the farming
 
06:43:40.718 --> 06:43:42.310 align:start position:0%
a practical matter for the farming
community

06:43:42.310 --> 06:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:43:44.548 --> 06:43:44.558 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea i would like to see
 
06:43:45.990 --> 06:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
more involvement
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
but i think this
 
06:43:50.150 --> 06:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't is is going to be a total
 
06:43:51.990 --> 06:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
disappointment if you attempt to
 
06:43:54.390 --> 06:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
implement it in this manner
 
06:43:57.590 --> 06:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
06:44:00.070 --> 06:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh anything else for the commissioner i
 
06:44:02.230 --> 06:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
think it's good advice
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's sound advice thank you
 
06:44:07.190 --> 06:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:07.200 --> 06:44:08.548 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:44:08.548 --> 06:44:08.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:44:10.708 --> 06:44:10.718 align:start position:0%
so we are done this work session i
 
06:44:12.548 --> 06:44:12.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the department and the
 
06:44:13.830 --> 06:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming over this

afternoon we do have a handout that the
 
06:44:18.390 --> 06:44:18.400 align:start position:0%

acting as the legislative co-chair of
 
06:44:48.788 --> 06:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
the youth advisory council we quite
 
06:44:50.788 --> 06:44:50.798 align:start position:0%
often met with

representatives from other countries
 
06:44:54.548 --> 06:44:54.558 align:start position:0%

edifying and rewarding
 
06:46:31.190 --> 06:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
if i can just add to that i've probably
 
06:46:33.110 --> 06:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
been on a dozen panels for them over the
 
06:46:36.150 --> 06:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
years and i find it really rewarding as
 
06:46:37.670 --> 06:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
they always have a really interesting
 
06:46:39.830 --> 06:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
group sponsored by the state department
 
06:46:41.270 --> 06:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
and the state department sends them to
 
06:46:42.948 --> 06:46:42.958 align:start position:0%
my half dozen places around the country
 
06:46:45.510 --> 06:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is one of them and it's
 
06:46:47.830 --> 06:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
just it's a great group and as i say
 
06:46:49.350 --> 06:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
it's usually a whole group that the
 
06:46:50.788 --> 06:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
state department has put together and
 
06:46:53.590 --> 06:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
sent around the country
 
06:46:55.750 --> 06:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
kids in the youth advisory
 
06:46:57.670 --> 06:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
always love it after they've met with
 
06:46:59.590 --> 06:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
these other young people from around the
 
06:46:59.600 --> 06:47:00.788 align:start position:0%
these other young people from around the
world

06:47:00.788 --> 06:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
world
 
06:47:03.590 --> 06:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
they just learn and ask questions and it
 
06:47:05.030 --> 06:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
but this would be a chance for us
 
06:47:06.310 --> 06:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're not looking for young people
 
06:47:08.230 --> 06:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
with this they're looking for people who
 
06:47:10.548 --> 06:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
are knowledgeable about education in the
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire so just throwing
 
06:47:13.590 --> 06:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
out a
 
06:47:15.190 --> 06:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
courage thank you very much people that
 
06:47:17.510 --> 06:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
are interested uh why don't you let me
 
06:47:19.990 --> 06:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
know and then i will coordinate with
 
06:47:24.150 --> 06:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:25.910 --> 06:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
jasmine who's the person that is
 
06:47:28.628 --> 06:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
coordinating it uh mr chair if i could
 
06:47:30.390 --> 06:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
speak before you lose any more of your
 
06:47:32.548 --> 06:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
members over there regarding the handout
 
06:47:35.270 --> 06:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
that uh i just gave to you
 
06:47:37.510 --> 06:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is a little homework assignment
 
06:47:40.628 --> 06:47:40.638 align:start position:0%
from me i found the article fascinating
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
it came from the boston globe and it was
 
06:47:46.390 --> 06:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
written by the chair of the derry school
 
06:47:46.400 --> 06:47:47.430 align:start position:0%
written by the chair of the derry school
board

06:47:47.430 --> 06:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
06:47:47.440 --> 06:47:48.548 align:start position:0%
board
so

06:47:48.548 --> 06:47:48.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:51.510 --> 06:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be exceptionally pertinent
 
06:47:54.230 --> 06:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
and timely information given the fact
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we've been sort of
 
06:47:58.468 --> 06:47:58.478 align:start position:0%
knocking around this idea of
 
06:47:58.478 --> 06:47:59.510 align:start position:0%
knocking around this idea of
public

06:47:59.510 --> 06:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
06:48:02.070 --> 06:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
participation and the role of school
 
06:48:04.868 --> 06:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
boards and
 
06:48:07.590 --> 06:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
just because
 
06:48:12.230 --> 06:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:15.830 --> 06:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
i checked a little bit on the
 
06:48:18.468 --> 06:48:18.478 align:start position:0%
nature of these chairperson of the
 
06:48:21.830 --> 06:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
school board in derry because i thought
 
06:48:24.150 --> 06:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
please don't let this be a whining
 
06:48:27.750 --> 06:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
democrat please don't let this be uh
 
06:48:27.760 --> 06:48:29.910 align:start position:0%
democrat please don't let this be uh
right

06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:48:33.270 --> 06:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
so so i i just want you to know that i
 
06:48:33.280 --> 06:48:34.150 align:start position:0%
so so i i just want you to know that i
uh

06:48:34.150 --> 06:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:48:36.230 --> 06:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
am not forcing you into reading anything
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
that i don't think you'll be interested
 
06:48:37.920 --> 06:48:38.708 align:start position:0%
that i don't think you'll be interested
in

06:48:38.708 --> 06:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
in
 
06:48:40.948 --> 06:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
i believe that you would have a lot
 
06:48:43.990 --> 06:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
ideologically uh in common with the
 
06:48:47.350 --> 06:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairperson of the derry school board
 
06:48:50.390 --> 06:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i would ask that you read it and if
 
06:48:53.430 --> 06:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
there is any interest for fruitful
 
06:48:56.390 --> 06:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion later on perhaps we could
 
06:48:58.788 --> 06:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
discuss it as part of a
 
06:49:00.868 --> 06:49:00.878 align:start position:0%
either our exact session on public
 
06:49:03.510 --> 06:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
participation or
 
06:49:05.270 --> 06:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have a book talk on it a
 
06:49:07.350 --> 06:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
book talk that one now there's an idea
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
and then we can have representative
 
06:49:10.230 --> 06:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
woodcock give us the cliff notes we're
 
06:49:13.270 --> 06:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to call it a tandy's talk and
 
06:49:13.280 --> 06:49:16.230 align:start position:0%
going to call it a tandy's talk and
uh

06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:18.548 --> 06:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
so i would appreciate it though if i i
 
06:49:20.468 --> 06:49:20.478 align:start position:0%
found it to be uh
 
06:49:23.590 --> 06:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
really quite eye-opening uh it
 
06:49:25.830 --> 06:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
the school board meetings in bedford
