e

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
um sorry for the slight delay and make
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
some copies
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
um since we last met as a subcommittee
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
um representative infantine and myself
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
um met with the Department of Labor um
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
and uh had a very uh in-depth um
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
conversation they had done a lot of work
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
done a lot of research
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
and um they uh had offered us uh two
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
options for an amendment and I intended
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
to have an actual Amendment today but um
 
00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
and and you you folks are great about
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
getting some something to us on Monday
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
but uh OS seems to be to be busy with
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
800 um
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
lsrs um so uh I I did not get the
 
00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:24.639 align:start position:0%
Amendments yet um but at any rate this
 
00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:27.079 align:start position:0%
this is uh nicely done by the attorneys
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Labor and it
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
effectively provides two
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
options and
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the first
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
option um basically adopts the um
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
1910 um uh standards um D through Z with
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
the exception of U um and it um is
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
adopted um three years from now um the
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
idea is to give um every everyone who
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
needs it including the department uh
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of time for um the uh preparation
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
um to to learn the standards to deal
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
with whatever needs to be deal dealt
 
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
with and um and basically the department
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
would um be putting on additional um
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
Personnel in order to help the uh the
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
the employers um with with the
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
transition so um it seemed to be a more
 
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
workable manner of adopting the 1910
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
standards um providing that three-year
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
everyone that's option
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
one option two um is
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
um a little bit different it comes out
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
of the uh Department as a alternative
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
and a
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
essentially instead of adopting 1910
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
1910 as written by um
 
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
OSHA it uses 1910 as a think it's fair
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
to say as a guide um and that the
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
department over the course of three
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
years would engage in rul making that
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
would um come up with standards that are
 
00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
at least um as effective as the OSHA
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
standards um so basically all those gaps
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
that are that exist in the current um
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
department of labor standards would be
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
filled um using OSHA as a guide as to
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
um they would basically take those three
 
00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
years um to to do that
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
um one difference is that they probably
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
would not need as many um uh additional
 
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
employees for for the ramp up um their
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
thought is that the U the standards
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
would be at least as effective but
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps easier to um to read and so um
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
employers who are going through the
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
the the standards that are developed
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
through Ru making will have an easier
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
time figuring out exactly what they need
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
to do um but they still have that
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
three-year window um to get ready
 
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to get ahead of the
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
department can simply use the 1910
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
standards to um say okay what what's
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
still coming um it also gives them the
 
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:41.720 align:start position:0%
authority to skip some sections um if
 
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:43.480 align:start position:0%
there's a section that does not apply to
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
any public sector employer in the state
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
um if if it deals with mining or
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
something like that um there's no need
 
00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:54.759 align:start position:0%
to have standards for um safe standards
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
around around mining for um uh you know
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
public sector workers in New Hampshire
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
um but any section that does is
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
applicable to the public sector workers
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would have rules that
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
um also provides for an annual review of
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
of Standards so that um as o if OSHA
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
upgrades its standards the department
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
would um uh write rules to reflect those
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
upgrades um so that it remains at least
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
standards and it also indicates that um
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner May seek additional
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
Staffing um that Staffing would be paid
 
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
um out of the um the funds that the
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
department has on hand um but it would
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
need to get author authorization to use
 
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
those funds for that additional Staffing
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I would ask uh chairman
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
infantine if he's got if I if I've
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
missed anything and frankly I'll be
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
happy to hear from the um the department
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
well representative Sullivan no I I I
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any uh comments about what
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
you said you you've stated you know
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
correctly as per our our meeting with
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
the Department um really what it comes
 
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
down to is trying to implement something
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
that is manageable to both the
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
department Municipal and government
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
um bodies and the employees um that
 
00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:52.759 align:start position:0%
serve on you know that that that are
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
within those departments
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
um you know my my concern has always
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
been um what we don't know and wanting
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we don't Implement
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
something that uh we find out later has
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
caused uh considerable cost or or um
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
inconvenience to the
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
um you know to these parties um I saw
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
your finger so I'll let you have a
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
dialogue I I just remembered something
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
um folks may recall the department ofy
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
employment no not employment department
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
of environmental services um came in
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
with a concern that they've got uh air
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
quality testing equipment that is uh
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
very high quality very high tech very
 
00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
expensive um however it's made overseas
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
and so it would not U meet the OSHA um
 
00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh certification requirements um
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
because of if if we went with option
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
option one um they they would probably
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
be um required to replace that equipment
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
with um OSHA certified equipment if we
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
went with option two it would allow um
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
the department to or allow the
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to um effectively
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
certify that equipment as at least
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
effective and at least as effective and
 
00:18:24.149 --> 00:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
um they could continue using it um
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
so when the unknowns happen um and when
 
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh the other example that was used
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
during our
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
meeting was rather interesting it was
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
was it exitor yeah um exitor has a town
 
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
um building town hall
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
probably that is very
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
historic um and um the
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh the entrance door is a big thick Oak
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
wooden door um OSHA would not approve
 
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
that door as being a fire door um in
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
order to be approved by OSHA with a
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
Bonafide fire door it has to be um you
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
know certain standards and it has to
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
have a plate attached to it um labeling
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
it as oosha
 
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
or as as a fire door um apparently if
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
you paint over that um that label uh it
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
is no longer a certified um fire door um
 
00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
if you remove the label even though it's
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the same door it's no longer a certified
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
fire door um certainly these oakd doors
 
00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
don't have labels don't have any um uh
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
would not be deemed certified fire doors
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
but uh the department um suggests and I
 
00:19:53.669 --> 00:19:53.679 align:start position:0%
would have to U trust their expertise
 
00:19:58.590 --> 00:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that um those o oak doors would serve as
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
fire doors um and the town of exitor
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
would not have to put um a a new
 
00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
upgraded very uh modern uh fire door on
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
a building that's very historic in doors
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
you know replacing doors that are
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
themselves very historic um so the air
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
testing equipment the oak fire doors um
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
are examples of
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
um things that happened in New Hampshire
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
that uh OSHA wouldn't be happy about um
 
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.789 align:start position:0%
that uh OSHA wouldn't be happy about um
and

00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
um I think the anticipation is going to
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
what chairman infantine said um the um
 
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
as towns and departments and various all
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
the public entities in the state have
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
the department come in and say can you
 
00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:55.559 align:start position:0%
do a review for us can you give us an
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
idea where we stand um
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
other examples of like the oak doors May
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
pop up um might be dramatically
 
00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:08.919 align:start position:0%
different from that but there just might
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
be other issues that OSHA wouldn't like
 
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
but um the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
Labor could say this is as effective as
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
the OSHA um
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
certified whatever and um so it puts the
 
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
department in a position to to to
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
um determine whether or not things that
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
are going on in the counties and the
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
schools in the towns um in the agencies
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
whether um they're as effective or need
 
00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
um in my opinion um option two probably
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
is the direction we I would suggest we
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
head uh um but um I'd be happy to hear
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh from other members of the committee
 
00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
as to what their thoughts are and
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully I've talked long enough so
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
the uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
um which part would allow the um
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner to make those types of
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
um the the very first paragraph employer
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
shall provide employees a level of
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
protection that is at least as effective
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
so those words are what allows the um
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
Department to make a judgment as to
 
00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:48.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not the
 
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:49.909 align:start position:0%
whether or not the
safety

00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:51.630 align:start position:0%
safety
um

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh environment within a particular
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
public entity is at least as effective
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
um with without those words it would
 
00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
have to be exactly the same as OSHA
 
00:23:02.159 --> 00:23:05.870 align:start position:0%
have to be exactly the same as OSHA
standards

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank thank you um couple things
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro also has a big old door in um
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
our library so um that I think would
 
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
also apply one of the things that was
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
brought to my attention over the last
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
couple weeks is that um OSHA has a
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
specific standard for the Marine
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
um people that Patrol marine and
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
anybody's working out in the waters
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
uh so and I have not gone through our
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
1910 standard to see how we're
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
addressing that in our 1910 or if it is
 
00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
even addressed my understanding from the
 
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
conversation and I'm okay being
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
corrected if I misunderstood is that
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
1910 does not address the Marine
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
standards but that there is a specific
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
OSHA regulation that does and given our
 
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
um Marine Patrol and other um public
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
entities that operate on our Waters I
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
think we should consider that as well as
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would looked to the
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
department I I know that um
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Gardner um went through this
 
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.190 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Gardner um went through this
in

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
um you know minute detail so I are you
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
familiar with whether or not 1910 has
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
marine or whether the other there are
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
two other sections of oosha standards
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
that uh perhaps
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
May so yes thank you for the question um
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
so as I understand it again as we talked
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
about 1910 is General Industry so
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's probably some pieces that will
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
go to some of the Marine aspects of it
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
and if I remember correctly I believe
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's either 1926 1928 or there is
 
00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:44.799 align:start position:0%
another set of standards as well that is
 
00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
very very detailed as to um you know
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
Marine aspects um so again to your
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
specific question I think there's some
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
pieces that would be applicable in the
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
1910s again just being General Industry
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
um but if the committee wanted to
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
actually drill down and get to more very
 
00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:01.720 align:start position:0%
specific standards it might have to look
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
at um the other sections of Osha in
 
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.510 align:start position:0%
at um the other sections of Osha in
later

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
you I question
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure so in in terms of Staffing um which
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
was mentioned in one of the proposals
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
the increase in
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh can you can you give me a
 
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.190 align:start position:0%
Staffing uh can you can you give me a
sense

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
of where what you're looking to do in
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
terms of Staffing and the other question
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
I have is that there was some I was
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
reading an audit of the D I think it a
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
year or two ago um and they talked about
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
the shifting costs and the workers comp
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
and I think there was some issue around
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
how much of of the Department's
 
00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility was being moved over to
 
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.950 align:start position:0%
responsibility was being moved over to
the

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.510 align:start position:0%
the
compend

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
compend
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know where the money is
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
coming from to do this uh but it seemed
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
to me in reading that audit report there
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
were some limitations as as shifting
 
00:26:08.389 --> 00:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
some of these costs over to uh because
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the way the do is is is uh
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
structured is there there are kind of
 
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
petitions between uh the way that the
 
00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
administrative fund the comp fund and
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
other things like that so tell me how
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to work and and if you
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
could also give me a sense
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
of of what you think you would need and
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh given and I don't know how many
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
workplaces there are in New Hampshire um
 
00:26:37.389 --> 00:26:37.399 align:start position:0%
but maybe give us a sense of how this
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
would work and uh if we're going to do
 
00:26:43.389 --> 00:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
it we should do it the best we can I
 
00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
guess no sorry from the last meeting and
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
quote me if I'm wrong I think it was
 
00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
like 250 municipalities I believe that's
 
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:52.520 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner Focus so it's
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
about 250 M municipalities plus
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
depending on how you count State um at
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
agencies about 40 State
 
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
agencies um so for option one which is
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
what I call the holistic adoption of
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
1910 um wholesale adoption over the
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
course of three years we're thinking
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
just because it's a wholesale adoption
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
um that and that there'll be confusion
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
and a need for additional inspections um
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
during that threeyear time frame where
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
the inspectors are going to go in
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to be basically doing
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
double inspections one for current
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
compliance and one for where they need
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
to be in three years we're thinking they
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
we'll need 12 staff members plus maybe
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
one additional administrative staff
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
member person um currently our
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
inspectors our safety inspectors are
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
labor grade
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
22 uh entry level with no experience uh
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.509 align:start position:0%
 
50,45976

00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
if we kept it at that same labor grade
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
which I'm not sure if we would uh we
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
haven't had that level of discussion but
 
00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:05.480 align:start position:0%
if we talk about that plus benefits the
 
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200 align:start position:0%
lower-end benefit package that we try to
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
um estimate would be employee plus one
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
cost $3 31,725 in addition to their um
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
their wages so uh so it's about
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per uh employee for for the uh
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors um so that's option one we
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
are looking into whether or not
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
contractors is something that might be
 
00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:34.519 align:start position:0%
looked you know applicable to here um we
 
00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cost is for that um
 
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
as well as the requirement you know how
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
you can oversee the work of a contractor
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's not something the department has
 
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
done before we have a very very limited
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
contract line now um uh in the amount in
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
by mean by Limited in funds uh so that
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
something that we would be willing to
 
00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
explore as well with respect to to
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
making those staffing needs um so that's
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
option one option two given the fact
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be controlling the
 
00:29:09.389 --> 00:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
language and the accessibility of the uh
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
rules that we be adopting U because
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
they're going to be equivalent to OSHA
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
but the wording would be different we're
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
not adopting all of the federal uh 1910
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
standards it would be only things that
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
are applicable um we think that you know
 
00:29:24.029 --> 00:29:24.039 align:start position:0%
the training oh sorry let me go back to
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
training for an inspector under current
 
00:29:27.909 --> 00:29:27.919 align:start position:0%
standards for our safety inspectors
 
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
takes about 6
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
months to get them into you know on
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
their own out on the road able to assess
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
and do a complete inspection um I'm
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
thinking with a federal o that'll take
 
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
about a year to get them up to speed um
 
00:29:44.789 --> 00:29:44.799 align:start position:0%
and again we've never done this before
 
00:29:47.549 --> 00:29:47.559 align:start position:0%
so that this is an estimate uh and then
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
so for so that to keep that in mind as
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
well with respect to how quickly we can
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
get them up to speed and on the road uh
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
for the option two because they'll be
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
more accessible I don't think training
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
will take as long and we will still need
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
more inspectors on the road just because
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
more more regulation means more
 
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
inspectors it's more babysitting of a
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
case observing and getting into current
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
compliance so I'm thinking six
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
inspectors plus one additional
 
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
administrative staff member the problem
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
with both plans though just so you're
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
aware one of the things to be aware of
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
we have very limited sta uh sorry very
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
limited space within the Department of
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
Labor's building currently I
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
our safety inspectors I can barely fit
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
the three positions I have now uh we
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
would need to rent additional space to
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
house additional staff um and we can I I
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
can't speak directly to the costs where
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know where the budget would be
 
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:53.549 align:start position:0%
you know where the budget would be
access

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay before you start I'd like to
 
00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
publicly uh congratulate at uh um you on
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
your elevation to the Deputy
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner thank you I very much
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I'll do my best um I'm
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I'm the Deputy
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the Department of Labor
 
00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
I will do my best to answer the question
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
um relative to where the funding would
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
come from what the department has
 
00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.240 align:start position:0%
proposed uh with both proposals whether
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
it's the wholesale adoption or the um as
 
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
as effective as option the funding
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
stream would come through uh primarily
 
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
two mechanisms it would be through the
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
administ fund that set forth through 281
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
a59 um I think that's what was referred
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
to as the insurance carrier uh
 
00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:35.110 align:start position:0%
to as the insurance carrier uh
assessment

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh which is through the workers
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
compensation statute which includes the
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh safety Provisions that come along
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
with workers compensation there are
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
certain safety requirements set forth in
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
the workers comp statute that require
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
employers to provide safe workplace
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
environments such that you can minimize
 
00:31:53.909 --> 00:31:53.919 align:start position:0%
uh and reduce the costs associated with
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
workplace injuries and through the
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
restricted fund which is where the other
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
revenues that the department brings in
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
come through uh there is discretion in
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
the language for the commissioner to
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
determine how to abortion uh that
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
funding but that those would be the
 
00:32:07.909 --> 00:32:07.919 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms that the department
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
would be looking at with either option
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's the enhanced number of
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
Staff needed for a wholeale adoption or
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
whether the um somewhat reduced number
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
of staff that would be needed for the as
 
00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:20.440 align:start position:0%
likely as
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
option and is it fair to say that um
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
neither option would have an impact on
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
the general fund I think it's possible
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm not certain that this point that
 
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
I would be um accurate in trying to
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
quantify that I I think it would depend
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
possible thank you um so early on in
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
when we met in the subcommittee there
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
was conversation about uh Federal
 
00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
funding that we could apply for if we go
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
to the ocean standards I'm assuming that
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
if we were to go to option number two
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
that that Federal funding wouldn't be
 
00:32:59.230 --> 00:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
available because it's going to be your
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
own Department making the rule making I
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
believe that to be accurate and I'll
 
00:33:04.629 --> 00:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
defer to attorney Gardner if I'm not to
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
clarify option one and option two would
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
give us no federal funding what you're
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
referring to is the OSHA state plan
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
which requires adoption of all OSHA
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
standards and as we discussed at the
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee you're referencing um that's a
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
very very lengthy process that's in
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
conjunction with OSHA so neither option
 
00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
would get us any federal funds
 
00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:36.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
let me ask let me ask you see the
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
Department's going to return based on a
 
00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
statement that you made uh I think last
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
week that the department will send back
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
to the to the rainy day fund some $3
 
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
million this year um this is in addition
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
to the two plus million they sent back
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
in the past now the stream for that
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
money is that available in any way for
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
the this kind of work and either in the
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
from thank you for the question the the
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
give back provision or the give back
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
that the department is making this year
 
00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:19.079 align:start position:0%
roughly 3 million and the amount prior
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
was I believe 2 million um comes from
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
the revenue that the department takes in
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
primarily through its civil penalty
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
assessment AC
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
that involves both insurance carriers as
 
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
well as through the labor laws that are
 
00:34:34.589 --> 00:34:34.599 align:start position:0%
currently codified um the funding the
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
the amount that gets brought in is
 
00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
dependent it's dependent upon a couple
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
of things it's dependent upon insurance
 
00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
carrier compliance it's dependent upon
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
employer compliance and how many
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
violations uh on either side under 281a
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
or under 275 uh 276 and all the other
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
labor statutes that um come about um it
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
fluctuates if you look at the history of
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
what the department has turned back over
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
to the general fund an excess Revenue in
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
that context it it has changed from year
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
to year um but it comes from the excess
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we're taking in primarily
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
actions I think it I I believe it to be
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I will correct if I am inaccurate
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
that it could be I would note that given
 
00:35:20.589 --> 00:35:20.599 align:start position:0%
that there is some
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
inconsistency dependent upon what the
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
department has come across within the
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
preceeding um year or so that the amount
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
fluctuate oh no worries I my no worries
 
00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:35.960 align:start position:0%
at all thank you I also know that the
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner in our meeting last week
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
indicated that he was going to check to
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
find out what the procedure would be for
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
accessing those funds for this purpose
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
has he had a chance to do that at this
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
point I don't I do not believe that we
 
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
have't answer thus far okay thank
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions so so there was a question
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
about um writing a new standard and then
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
getting it through jail car so what's
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
the expectation um that you're going to
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
drop pages and pages of of revisions on
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
on that committee um and if that doesn't
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
go through this whole thing goes down
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
basically doesn't work correct meaning
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the option to sector doing it via the
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
ru do either one you'd have to go in
 
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
front of Joe for yes if option two were
 
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
the option that uh ultimately ended up
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
going forward it would be subject to the
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
same requirements that any form of
 
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking would go through meaning that
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
it has to go through that jail car rule
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
making process and finally approved by
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
jail car I would note that I think
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
historically the department has had very
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
good success in drafting its rules uh
 
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
and has not had T difficulty typically
 
00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
having them pass through jail car but
 
00:36:53.069 --> 00:36:53.079 align:start position:0%
they would be subject to that that level
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
of review and final Jael car
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I need to
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
follow up on
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
that because we have all these wonderful
 
00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
things called rules and
 
00:37:16.309 --> 00:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
laws so we pass a law that says
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
X aren't am I correct that your rule
 
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240 align:start position:0%
making that would go to jel car is just
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
explaining how you're going to enforce
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
them it is not adopting an entire
 
00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
package of because if this
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee passes a bill and it gets
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
passed and signed by the governor we
 
00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
have a law that says again we don't know
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
what it's look like but pretty good idea
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
of what it would look like and it would
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
would would State a lot of the details
 
00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:51.640 align:start position:0%
1910 so J car doesn't have to approve
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
1910 correct they're just approving your
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of 1910 yes
 
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
representative infantine I think that's
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
an accurate uh statement the the
 
00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
statutory language if it went into
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
effect would give the department
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
rulemaking Authority um and sets that
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
tone of the requirement that there be
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
rules out that there be that the
 
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
department is implementing standards
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
that are at least as effective um as the
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
ocean 1910 standards Provisions uh the D
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
through Z the exception of subpart U um
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the rules
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
themselves and I'm not certain if that
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
answered your question so was that last
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
but it's not the rules themselves so the
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
statute's not mandating the language and
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
the rules themselves it does give the
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
authority to the department to then
 
00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
promulgate those rules the rules would
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
be promulgated or written with the eye
 
00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
towards 1910 as that guide post as
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan had explained
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
incorporating the portions that are
 
00:38:46.829 --> 00:38:46.839 align:start position:0%
necessary for for New Hampshire's public
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
municipality School District state
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
agencies um Those portions would then be
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
going through that final Jael car
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
approval process thank you I just wanted
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure you everyone understood
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
that the entire 1910 doesn't get
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
approved by J car it's just their rules
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
about implementation of that would be
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
correct and um could you envision at in
 
00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:13.319 align:start position:0%
some places uh saying the 1910 um
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
standard is written in a manner that we
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
want to adopt and just use the OSHA uh
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
language as is would you anticipate
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
doing that in some
 
00:39:25.950 --> 00:39:25.960 align:start position:0%
instances it would if if the assessment
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
were that what was necessary that is
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
something that could be done I don't
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
know at this juncture whether or not
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary given that we're
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
not in that spot as of right now um but
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that there would be
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
anything in the proposed language for
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
that section option that would preclude
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
or prevent the department from saying
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
this section of 1910 um is exactly the
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
rule that the department requires in
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
order to enforce a certain type of
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
safety standard throughout the state of
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and taking or utilizing
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
that language wholesale
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
okay and I'll look at at attorney
 
00:39:59.550 --> 00:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
Gardner in case I've misspoken on that
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
no no I obviously agree with Deputy
 
00:40:03.309 --> 00:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Albert um and just a kind
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
of point of clarity here each option
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
here as of the effective date would
 
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
require all employers subject to this
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
chapter to provide um safety that's at
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
least as effective as section 1910 so to
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
your question representative McKenzie um
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know say for example that the rule
 
00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
Mak doesn't go through um obviously I
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
think that's problematic in the sense
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
that we all want employers to understand
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
what standards they're being held to and
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
that's the uh point of the rul making
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
provision but again as of the date of
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
the effective date of either of these
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
bills the employers would be required to
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
provide that level of protection so it's
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
not a matter of if the rul making
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't go through for say ladders then
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing on ladders it's just a
 
00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
reference to 1910 versus an explicit um
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
explanation and rul
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
making something that wasn't immediately
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
clear to me on this um I'm glad I'm
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
thinking of this because is a question
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
we needed to get
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
out um can you describe how the um
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
replacement of current um standards with
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
the new standards as you do with Ru
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
making would would it be a situation
 
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
where the the rules stay in the rul
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
making process is effectively sort of a
 
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:20.680 align:start position:0%
rolling replacement of current standards
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
yes I think that would be accurate to
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
State um as testified to previously the
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
intent with this would be not just
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
merely the three-year plan but an annual
 
00:41:30.309 --> 00:41:30.319 align:start position:0%
review to see if there's any updated
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
standards that might be applicable to
 
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employers as well so again
 
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:35.440 align:start position:0%
um just going forward there would be an
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
annual review of all standards to make
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
sure that uh they make sense and we're
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
providing safety that's at least as
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
effective as section 1910 because
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues that um we'
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
identified I think two weeks ago was
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
that um if the uh if the bill calls for
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
the repeal of all current department of
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
labor standards in the eventual
 
00:41:59.470 --> 00:41:59.480 align:start position:0%
replacement it would leave a vacuum for
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
a period of time which we don't want
 
00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct the caveat being that um
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
again the first section of each of these
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
bills would require employers to provide
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
that level of protection but it it hurts
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
Clarity so essentially the current the
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
current standards would remain in place
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
until the rulemaking process um you know
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
in bits and pieces over the next three
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
years um replaces the current standards
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
with um at least as effective standards
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
correct any current standards in place
 
00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
the department would review in light of
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
the 1910 standards determine if there
 
00:42:34.549 --> 00:42:34.559 align:start position:0%
needs to be an update to those and then
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
obviously anything that's silent we
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
would determine how far we need to go
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
with those standards what we need to
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
implement for New Hampshire employers so
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
option two does not um requ uh need a
 
00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
section that talks about repealing
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
because the rulle making process itself
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
effectively does the repealing I think
 
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
that would be correct to State and
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's anything that the
 
00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:55.960 align:start position:0%
department found through the rul making
 
00:42:57.069 --> 00:42:57.079 align:start position:0%
process process or review of our
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
standards whether it's uh again rules we
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
would update through the JL car process
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
if it's something that's statutory we
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
would bring it to the legislature um and
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
advise that there might need to be an
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman just for the
 
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
record for some of the members of the
 
00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.150 align:start position:0%
record for some of the members of the
committee

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.430 align:start position:0%
committee
1910

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
1910
 
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
um has letters a through z right we are
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
excluding A and B A is general b is
 
00:43:28.349 --> 00:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
adoption of extension of establishing
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
Federal standards and C currently is
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
blank it's reserved right we also do not
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
have they do not have
 
00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:41.559 align:start position:0%
subparts vwx and Y so I just want to
 
00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
make sure we we we uh we amend
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
the to not include those because they're
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
reserved so what I don't want to happen
 
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
is next uh a bill passes here a year
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
from now uh ocean decides they want to
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
include a new section V well if we
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
include in our laws it's automatic so I
 
00:44:06.549 --> 00:44:06.559 align:start position:0%
want to exclude make sure we do exclude
 
00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
U which is the co part uh vwx and Y
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
which are reserved in blank so just so
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
you know what the the A through Z are if
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
you want you can see this
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
outline one of the things that we
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
discussed in the meeting um which I
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
always enjoy getting up at 6:15 in the
 
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
morning and watching the sunrise over
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
the mountains of Arizona but it was it
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
was fine um I got to see a Road Runner
 
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
that morning hey so hey it was worth it
 
00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know how big a Road Runner
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
is not that though not like you know you
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
think on TV with the coyote and whatever
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things we discussed was
 
00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
misnomer that the Department is supposed
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
to review rules um regarding safety and
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
update them every two years that is not
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
accurate okay it is every 10 years um
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
and and it's that's important
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
because um I will tell you I think door
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
number one the wholesale adoption um
 
00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
what I'm always afraid of um
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative suoman is um things that
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know you know we've been here
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
long enough you and I and a number of
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
people here on this committee have been
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
here long enough to know that what we do
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
when we sit here and pass a piece of
 
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:26.870 align:start position:0%
when we sit here and pass a piece of
legislation

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
um sounds good we think we're doing the
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
right thing and then it gets out into
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
the real world and sometimes we find
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
that it needs a little
 
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.470 align:start position:0%
that it needs a little
tweaking

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
tweaking
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but again we don't want to perfect
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
get in the way of getting something done
 
00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
so I would rather move if anything with
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
with uh option two you're talking six
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
employees versus 12 you have a situation
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
where you don't have a place to house
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
the employees as it is having to get it
 
00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
through a second committee on finance
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
the goal is to get something passed
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no goal in getting something
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
passed through the house which is not
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
going to get passed by the Senate and
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
and implemented
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
so option two has a better chance of
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.829 align:start position:0%
getting that
done

00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
um my desire
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
which sounds good to me but probably
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
not easy to implement
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
is option
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
of well we talking you know what I'm
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
gonna say talking about in the telephone
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead um option three which is why
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
don't you just update your standards to
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
things you want to
 
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:49.640 align:start position:0%
do okay you have a standard that is in
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
place right
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
now right hasn't been updated maybe
 
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
eight or 10 years
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
so what I want to do is take some of the
 
00:46:59.790 --> 00:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
things that are most important through
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
from a through
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
z and Implement those the problem as
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
it's been expressed to me by staff
 
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
is there will be contradictions between
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
possibly the current rules and laws and
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
some of these these um in
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
1910 I'm not saying I have the
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
answer um to to what that is because I
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
am an idiot and I have read a lot of
 
00:47:31.119 --> 00:47:32.150 align:start position:0%
am an idiot and I have read a lot of
this

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
stuff um and I can tell you I've been in
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
in the insurance business for 30 years
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm OA 10
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
certified and I don't even know how to
 
00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:43.880 align:start position:0%
read some of this
 
00:47:46.349 --> 00:47:46.359 align:start position:0%
stuff okay so let alone some of the
 
00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
things that some of the municipalities
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
are going to have to find someone to
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
train or whether we're going to have to
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
have a train the trainer people someone
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor um so I'm
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
trying to implement this slowly as you
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
have agreed to in in a two or threee
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
period which I'm thankful and appreciate
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you doing that um because I
 
00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
just don't want to make some of these
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
mistakes because I don't want someone
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us saying well you
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
know those oak doors even though we put
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
a little thing on them or whatever yeah
 
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
it's still not going to work it's still
 
00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
not and um so I'm fearful of the unknown
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
but not so fearful that I don't want us
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
something so uh you don't have me at
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
hello but you had me at least better
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
funny I'm not that funny so when I have
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
so so at least um looking at number two
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
and starting there but that that's
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
really my only concern representative
 
00:48:50.789 --> 00:48:50.799 align:start position:0%
suoman is is implementing
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
stuff there was a bill you you were not
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
here uh at the time a bill passed the
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate and was signed by
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
the governor out of this
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee that was so
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
bad that we had to go back the first
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
week of January and repeal
 
00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:10.789 align:start position:0%
week of January and repeal
it

00:49:10.789 --> 00:49:10.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
um requiring everyone to have workers
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
compensation regardless of whether
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
you're uh an employer or not employee or
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
owner or not um we we kind of rejiggered
 
00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
and now that any state funded project
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
everyone on the site has to have it so
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
you know we solved it in a certain way
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I mean Governor Lynch had to
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
yank us all in the first week of January
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
and and and repeal it um so I I just
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to do something where we have
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
that because there's been it has been
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
too long since there's been some updates
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's I can't sit
 
00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
here in my profession and say we
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
safer that would be
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
foolish so I I'm I I'm between option
 
00:50:03.069 --> 00:50:03.079 align:start position:0%
two which I am happier with and then
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
option three so please for the record
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
for everybody else here why uh option
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
three or I'm going to call it door
 
00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:11.829 align:start position:0%
three or I'm going to call it door
number

00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
number
three

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
um could B probably be too problematic
 
00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.789 align:start position:0%
um could B probably be too problematic
to

00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
implement may I yeah sure you're the
 
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
you're the chairman
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
um in my former life I dealt with
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
schools and school boards and
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
superintendents and um one of the things
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
that I observed is the superintendent
 
00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
would often um be very careful to say I
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't do policy the school board does
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
that the school board is the
 
00:50:48.079 --> 00:50:49.549 align:start position:0%
that the school board is the
decision-making

00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
decision-making
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
body and then a good superintendent
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
would steer that school board into
 
00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
making good decisions that the
 
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.190 align:start position:0%
making good decisions that the
professional

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
educator helps them with um I see that
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
that has kind of happened here um the
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
department I mean we are the policy
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
makers we were that was stated at our
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
meeting last week by the
 
00:51:16.829 --> 00:51:16.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner um that is true you you are
 
00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
not the policy makers we
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
are keep that
 
00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
are keep that
straight

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
straight
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
however um then the department went and
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
developed an option that
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
um I mean they never said so um you can
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
if you want um but I believe option two
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
is something that you feel is uh far
 
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:43.880 align:start position:0%
more um reasonable for the State of New
 
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than um the wholesale adoption
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
um and on that basis and the fact that
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
you guys put it together if you put
 
00:51:56.309 --> 00:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
something together that you can't do
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
shame on
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
you um so I'm going to believe that you
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
put something together that you firmly
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
believe the department can um Can
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
Implement that's what we asked you two
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
weeks ago to do we want a clean
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
implementation of this process and
 
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
um you put together option one because
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much where we were going
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
into um last week and then you gave us
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
option two which was a modification of
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
um you know I think does what
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative infantine was talking
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
about it it allows the department to do
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
its thing to adopt New Hampshire
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
standards but it also provides a guide
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
through the 1910 standards to make sure
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't end up what we've got now
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
right now we've got standards but it's
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
full of gaps and we that was the um one
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the primary um objections to where we
 
00:52:57.789 --> 00:52:57.799 align:start position:0%
are compared to where we want to go and
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
I believe this option to um
 
00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:03.710 align:start position:0%
I believe this option to um
plan

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
um would fill fill those gaps it won't
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
fill any any gaps that don't need to be
 
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
filled um because you've got the
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
authority to skip over sections that are
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
not applicable
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
um but it does fill in all the gaps that
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
do apply to public sector um uh entities
 
00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
in um New Hampshire um and so I for one
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
um would like to take the Department's
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
lead you did what we asked you to do
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I there will be some who
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
will be I'll tell you the downside to to
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
doing option two is that it does not
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
adopt the 1910 standards and it it would
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult down the road to
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
create a state plan the state plan as
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
representative Susi you know reminded us
 
00:53:57.990 --> 00:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
comes with money Federal money um uh
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
option one puts us closer to adopting a
 
00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:02.599 align:start position:0%
state plan somewhere down the road
 
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
option two leaves us with a lot of
 
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:07.870 align:start position:0%
option two leaves us with a lot of
um

00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh state standards that will that won't
 
00:54:14.349 --> 00:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
match 1910 they will be at least as
 
00:54:18.309 --> 00:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
effective but they won't match but I
 
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
I I having said that I still think
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
option two is the way we ought to go um
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
because effectively it getss us to a
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
safer spot which is what we're trying to
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
do here um and if uh uh people down the
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
road 5 10 years from now want to do a
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
state plan um I say go for it but uh
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's not where we are now um so
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
um um I would entertain a motion if
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
unless there's further discussion that
 
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.069 align:start position:0%
unless there's further discussion that
we

00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:53.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:54:56.349 --> 00:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
need I would like further discussion
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not shutting it
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
down um
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
so option
 
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.990 align:start position:0%
so option
two

00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.109 --> 00:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
four the commissioner shall have
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
authority to determine if standards are
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
inapplicable to employers and are
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
implement representative salivan had
 
00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:25.870 align:start position:0%
implement representative salivan had
mentioned

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:55:29.549 --> 00:55:29.559 align:start position:0%
mining okay I'm looking at a through z
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
here and I'm going to put you on the
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
spot and if you can't answer it no no
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
harm no
 
00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:37.559 align:start position:0%
foul anything in
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
particular um I obviously you wouldn't
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
want to take out medical and first aid
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to take out fire
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
protection you wouldn't want to take
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
out uh Compressed Gas uh Material
 
00:55:49.029 --> 00:55:49.039 align:start position:0%
Handling machinery and machining
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
guarding I mean I don't know which one
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
you'd take out that's what I'm trying to
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
say here as I look through um all of
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
these welding cutting and brazing you
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
know which
 
00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
electrical driving so wouldn't
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily be take out it would be
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
simplify so for example and condense so
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
basically what I would be looking to do
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
is take that and this and try to figure
 
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
out a happy medium so for example the
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
lad section in 1910 and platform section
 
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.150 align:start position:0%
lad section in 1910 and platform section
in

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
1910 are basically identical so we don't
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
need both sections whol adopted we can
 
00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
combine the two so it would be making it
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
so that we're handing someone our new
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
rule book it's not the shock of 1100
 
00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:40.039 align:start position:0%
Pages um so I don't know what it what is
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
going to end up being in the end but
 
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be simplifying and
 
00:56:47.349 --> 00:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
condensing um 1910 so it's more
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
accessible there isn't that fear of
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
oversaturation of rules uh where a
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
person is handed 1100 pages and says I'm
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
not even going going to read that tell
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
me what I need to do uh I want something
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
that someone looks at and says well I'll
 
00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:03.079 align:start position:0%
at least give it a shot and
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
try um so that's that's you know so that
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
that is what we're looking at for when
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
it comes to a 1910 like adoption of our
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
rules um and just to address your
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
position uh representative Sullivan I
 
00:57:20.670 --> 00:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
think so this plan option to is modeled
 
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
over the fame model it's the federal
 
00:57:27.069 --> 00:57:27.079 align:start position:0%
annual um op annual mandatory
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
evaluations of Osha States so states
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
that are going they're trying to become
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
OSHA States so if becoming an OSHA state
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the future becomes a goal of New
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's basically a different way
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
to get there we're already doing the
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
annual reviews that a Fame state does so
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's moving so it's a different way to
 
00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:49.839 align:start position:0%
get there but I think it also is you
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
know doesn't close off an option we
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
already have that skeleton annual review
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
because OSHA they acknowledge that their
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
plan is not the best plan their any plan
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
that a state should adopt should be
 
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
something where every year is evaluated
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
and changed and and things are actually
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
getting looked at and addressed so so
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
there is so that so again I think it is
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
another way of meeting the same goal we
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
putting steps in place which OSHA would
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
like states that are looking to become
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
OSHA states to have so there's so again
 
00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a different way of going at
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
the same goal um thank you I just wanted
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
to clarify
 
00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
that let's talk about a timeline here
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
okay let's say this thing
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
gets um signed the loget signed by the
 
00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:43.960 align:start position:0%
governor in June of
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
24 okay so in order to take this and
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
that and put it
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
together um let's look what what time
 
00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
frame we're looking at
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
6 months a year so it's going to be a
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
same threeyear roll out so over time so
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
we're going and so unlike so when we
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
looked when the plans that we were
 
00:59:06.829 --> 00:59:06.839 align:start position:0%
looked to that we were asked to try to
 
00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
create an action plan initially was a
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
holistic approach or a peac meal
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
approach um so adopting 1910 as it reads
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
right now you can't adopt in a peacemeal
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
approach too many sections reference
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
each other so it will cause confusion
 
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
amongst the municipalities so we're
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
adopting provision C but that references
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
something sorry not c d but that
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
references something in E so you know
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
what you know what still what what are
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
we adopting what are we ar what aren't
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
we would be a question that we would
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
have to constantly explain to the public
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
employers uh if we did a peace meal
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
adoption of 1910 as it reads with the
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
option two that we're talking about here
 
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
we can do a peace meal because again
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
it'll be rolling rule adoption um over
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
the course of the 3 years to
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
minimize the sticker shock uh you know
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
the cost to towns so they can do they
 
01:00:05.950 --> 01:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
can budget and plan and roll things out
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
in piece in stages as opposed to now six
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
months you need to be in full compliance
 
01:00:10.599 --> 01:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
months you need to be in full compliance
with

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
1910 um so it is a three-year rollout
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
plan we'll be evaluating rules the
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
initial plan would be to fill in the
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
gaps that we do not address currently in
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
our 1400 rules then look at where we can
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
strengthen the things that we already
 
01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:29.799 align:start position:0%
speak to would be plan this would be the
 
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
second stage of the three-year rollout
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
plan and and I would point out that in
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
in section four um Roman four uh the
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
last sentence indicates that it's um
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
these standards would be at least as
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
effective within three years from the
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
passage of this act so that's what sets
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
up the three-year um
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
timeline understood Mr chairman I just I
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
need to be kind of a little more
 
01:00:57.390 --> 01:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
specific I on a timeline and and I'm not
 
01:00:59.230 --> 01:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
trying to harp but I just need to
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
mentally understand this because I'm
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
sure it'll be asked of
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
me it's get it gets implemented it gets
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
passed in June you have six months to
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
try to figure something out because then
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
you have to present it you know the
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
world needs to see it right okay and
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
then you still have two and a half years
 
01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
and you can do your as you you described
 
01:01:24.990 --> 01:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
earlier a pencil audit going into
 
01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
to these places to see where they don't
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
meet the new rules so the pencil audits
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
start from the passage so for me so
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
that's how I I'm so so you don't have
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
your your thing yet correct so we'll be
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
looking at it and saying what's not at
 
01:01:44.829 --> 01:01:44.839 align:start position:0%
least as effective and things that we'll
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
be addressing down the line but in the
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
meantime but they won't be held
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
accountable to that it it's like these
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
are our current standards this is what
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've currently set and this is where
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
your efficient and with current
 
01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:56.559 align:start position:0%
standards you have to get it to current
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
standard code but in the meantime this
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
is where we're leading so please start
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting for that um because my
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
inspectors are going to be the ones
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
helping me draft these rules in
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
conjunction with our legal unit um so
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
they'll know what's to come so they've
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
already started writing now um
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
so so that'll be the plan as we we all
 
01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
already know what's in the distance so
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
we can start informing the general
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
public and the the the stakeholders to
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities public employers uh then
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
we'll have our annual meetings which we
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
will be proposing our changes in advance
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
so to let them know these are the
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
changes that are going to be coming in
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be proposing to jel
 
01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:40.039 align:start position:0%
car and have their open have the public
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
session for them to speak about what any
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
concerns there could be another town of
 
01:02:47.069 --> 01:02:47.079 align:start position:0%
exit or issue that we didn't foresee we
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
knew about town of exit because we we've
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
recently inspected them um Dees that was
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
something that we learned of at this
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
meeting we didn't know about how their
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
air quality machines would be impacted
 
01:03:01.510 --> 01:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
by a 1910 roll out so that's where I
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate the stakeholders bringing up
 
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
their concerns so that we don't adopt
 
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:07.720 align:start position:0%
something that would make New Hampshire
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
less safe uh or less reasonable with
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
respect to our safety standards and and
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
you actually have it's not six months
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
that you have to write rules it's three
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
years you have so essentially um you can
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
start writing rules immediately start
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
cheating them into Jael car and um and
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
you've got a three-year period of time
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
to get get the job completely done and
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
have all of your rules um at least as
 
01:03:38.029 --> 01:03:38.039 align:start position:0%
effective that's the plan yes and but
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
with there being peace meal adoption of
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
our rules over time so it's not year
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
three learn that so that that's the plan
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.349 --> 01:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
the I'm saying this kind of jokingly
 
01:03:53.359 --> 01:03:56.950 align:start position:0%
the I'm saying this kind of jokingly
politely

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
I would not recommend saying again
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
sticker shock um in in in your testimony
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
because that's the big concern that some
 
01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
of us have we don't know what the cost
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be yet and we don't know the
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
cost we might be passing on I live in
 
01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester I can tell you
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
that they they're scratching their heads
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
at some of the departments in Manchester
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
with the Department of uh um Parks and
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
Rec and and what this is going to do to
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
them and when they ask me I can't tell
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
them what the costs are going because
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
again we're just getting down
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
to option two here versus the initial
 
01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
option one so that is a
 
01:04:48.349 --> 01:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
concern um the the the the the cost so
 
01:04:52.109 --> 01:04:52.119 align:start position:0%
option two would not have the and I have
 
01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:53.150 align:start position:0%
option two would not have the and I have
the

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
nrtl so this is the I had already
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
provided copies to both representative
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
Sullivan and infantine of what is
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
required to be nrtl approved so wherever
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
there is an equally safe option to nrtl
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
approval we would not be adopting that
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
so the you know the solid oak doors is
 
01:05:18.549 --> 01:05:18.559 align:start position:0%
an exitor those are effective even if
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
not more so than what they construct
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
today for fire doors um so is something
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
where we would maintain our reasonable
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
standard on option two that we would
 
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.240 align:start position:0%
lose in option one a whole sale adoption
 
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
lose in option one a whole sale adoption
of

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
1910 I'm sorry we're lost
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you don't
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
no you you were in Arizona that's right
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
lucky me
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
H what you have a question D
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
yep I did just what I just passed out
 
01:05:54.029 --> 01:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
was what um um you were just referring
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
refering to the um the list of um nrtl
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
approved things and um I think that's
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of led us into the oako
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
discussion as I recollect um
 
01:06:07.839 --> 01:06:09.910 align:start position:0%
discussion as I recollect um
representative

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
kcom thank you um I guess I I'd like to
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
go back and um revisit my question
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the the Marine Patrol fishing
 
01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
game and those um public entities that
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
work on the waters and how they're going
 
01:06:23.599 --> 01:06:24.589 align:start position:0%
work on the waters and how they're going
to

01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
be affected by what we're changing so
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
are they currently covered under our
 
01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
standards in the state so we're 1910
 
01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
does not cover that 1926 or 28 does how
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
how are they going to be impacted by
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing
 
01:06:44.309 --> 01:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
here I I have to look at it because um
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
currently uh the ports I believe so are
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
what is impacted under 1910 but have to
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
double check that it's been a little
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
while since I look directly at the
 
01:06:58.349 --> 01:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
Mar um because again it's so infrequent
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
that we have a very I think it's just
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
one location where it would be really
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
impacted well two locations um so it
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't come up very often so I'd have
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
to look at it as I believe there's a
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
port also in addition to um your uh the
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the Marine control that would be
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
impacted so think just two public
 
01:07:18.750 --> 01:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
employers really that it would Branch
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
into so I have to look into that and
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
find out oh um okay thanks what about
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
fishing game where they're working on
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
our Lakes they would fall under us yes
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
they would fall under the standards
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
right now they they they are are there
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
any specific Marine standards no um so
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
it ALS it would be a general duties but
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
they do fall under it as a Public
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
Employee yes all public employ sorry
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
public employers all fall under our
 
01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
statutes currently is there anything
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
specific to them no what about the fire
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
departments and the local municipalities
 
01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
that have boats that go out and um they
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
may go out and tend to people who are
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
drowning or accident cor they all fall
 
01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:56.839 align:start position:0%
under us there's nothing specific to
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
Marine time Marine so will they be
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
impacted by this change there would be
 
01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the uh there are various uh
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
organizations in the state prisons being
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
one of them that has a National Standard
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
that they follow the National Standard
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh and I don't think they're covered by
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
oosha um prisons
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
correct so how do you accommodate that
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
the public employees they're in this
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
environment you're passing rules do you
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
exempt them and I think their nursing
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
homes are very similar to that as well
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
so currently they do follow nursing
 
01:08:46.470 --> 01:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
homes and the prisons we were in there a
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
couple months ago uh do fall under our
 
01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:53.159 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um so where they fall under
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
both Federal standards so it's you know
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
usually again right now the federal
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
standards are more protective in the
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
sense that they're more specific to what
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
our laws state so it it is you know
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
because our current laws were based off
 
01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:10.600 align:start position:0%
of Osha a long time ago so it is so it's
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
basically the skeleton of what they have
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
today so it's just more detailed so they
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
are already basically if they are
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
following the federal standards which
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
apply to them they're under they're at
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
least as protective as our current
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
standards and it wouldn't necessarily
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
impact and either plan wouldn't impact
 
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
them currently now if now where the
 
01:09:35.349 --> 01:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
issue was where the dees issue um
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services theirs they have
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
a state so their Federal grant money is
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
contingent upon them complying with all
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
state and federal laws so for us for
 
01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
them currently they are following their
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
state mandate safety laws so if we were
 
01:09:55.510 --> 01:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
to adopt 1910 Hol sale and they weren't
 
01:09:57.550 --> 01:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't replace their current
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
Machinery which is at least as effective
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
as 1910 they would lose their Federal
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
funding because they're not they
 
01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:05.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be then in compliance with
 
01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:11.470 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be then in compliance with
state

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
law what you looking at me
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
for no I I think Mr avalani I had a cut
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
just a couple other quick questions um
 
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'm interested in um
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
particular uh how it is that you train
 
01:10:30.149 --> 01:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
people to deal with very serious
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
accidents serious death uh
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
accents now OSHA has a pretty robust um
 
01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
organization uh and they bring a lot of
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
resources to uh you know to the scene
 
01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
when they have when something happens or
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
when somebody lose a loss of life of
 
01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.310 align:start position:0%
when somebody lose a loss of life of
major

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
major
 
01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.870 align:start position:0%
major
casualty

01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
casualty
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
um so how do you how do you rep
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
replicate that
 
01:10:57.830 --> 01:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
capacity and does it make more sense to
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
yield to oer in cases like that so right
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
now we're not an OSHA state so we
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there and OSHA does not
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't come in currently there is no
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
yielding OSHA is not showing up um so
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
what we do now is very similar to um so
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
I I I'm a former prosecutor so we did
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know again um fatalities and and
 
01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
things negligent homicide investigations
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
and such which I oversaw we handle very
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
similar to that in that we are
 
01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
investigating I mean we're interviewing
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
Witnesses we're obtaining statements uh
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
for witness is to the um event we are
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
finding out what the current standards
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
and procedures are what is the training
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's being provided did they adhere to
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
that training is that training
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh if there's if it led to a
 
01:11:45.790 --> 01:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
crime in which accident reconstruction
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
is show up we request their reports so
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
we look at their reports right and to
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
determine what is Aur you know what did
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
they they determin happened and led to
 
01:11:58.550 --> 01:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that injury um you that is similar how
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
we you know and so that is how we handle
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
it it's very similar to you know and I
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
think it is similar to where OSHA is we
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
utilize the resources that the state
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
already has I don't know if OSHA would
 
01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
show up with accident reconstructionists
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
I've never seen that when we do have
 
01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:15.560 align:start position:0%
OSHA cases that intersect with ours um
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is an investigator that shows up very
 
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:19.960 align:start position:0%
similar to mine and is taking witness
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
statements um and they are also filing
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know subpoenas for the you know
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
local police acent reconstructions if it
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
if they did occur you know if one
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
occurred um so we you know what we do is
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
very similar
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
um to what I think OSHA would do based
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
on just my limited experience of dealing
 
01:12:41.709 --> 01:12:41.719 align:start position:0%
with cases in which there was a both a
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
public and private employer involved in
 
01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
the serious
 
01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
injury and if if I'm not mistaken um
 
01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
even if we were in OSHA State the
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
department of labor would still be the
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
um entity that would be responsible for
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
all of the you know maintaining OSHA
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
standards correct um and I think that U
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know under no circumstances could o
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
OSHA ever show up on a public sector
 
01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
workplace and um be taking over for the
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that's not what a
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
correct you do have the option to work
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
with them there's nothing that prohibits
 
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
you right now yeah just as much as
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
they're willing to work with us that's
 
01:13:31.629 --> 01:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
the only thing it prohibits okay so you
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
could potentially draw on them and say
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
come and help us and no so they won't
 
01:13:39.669 --> 01:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
come in and help us right now um so when
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have instances where our
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions intersect and they are
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
already doing a report sometimes we can
 
01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
request their report too there are
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
instances in which they will not share
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
them with us um but you know if we you
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
know we try to maintain a relationship
 
01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
with them such that they are comfortable
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
sharing their work product with us and
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
vice versa but there's nothing mandating
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you one final question it's
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
involved reports uh the the current
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
situation is that they the employeers
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
were required to file first the um the
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
plan initially as I understand it so
 
01:14:17.669 --> 01:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
they had to come up with their safety
 
01:14:19.550 --> 01:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
plan and they have to file that has to
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
be on in uh in the department somewhere
 
01:14:24.790 --> 01:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
that was changed they used to do it
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
every year they changed that so now they
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
but they do every two years they file an
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
up a no so that was taken so there there
 
01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:34.120 align:start position:0%
was an update to the state to the
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
statutes which they do not they just
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
have to file a safety summary not their
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
full plan with us once um and there are
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
they are required to review their safety
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
plan uh every two years so that when we
 
01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
do do inspections both a wage and hour
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
inspection and a safety inspection
 
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
inection with both public and private
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
sectors we do as part of our standard
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
requests ask to look at their safety
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
plan to see if it has been updated
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
within last two years so is there
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
anything we need to do uh in that area
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
as we go through this transition to make
 
01:15:11.550 --> 01:15:11.560 align:start position:0%
sure that they are they're complying or
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
updating um I I don't believe so both
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
would require them to maintain and
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
update every two years I'll double check
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
that but I don't think that
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
changes thank
 
01:15:22.199 --> 01:15:24.430 align:start position:0%
changes thank
you

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
thank you um are they required now to
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
keep track of their recordable incidents
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
they have to report to you on an annual
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
basis what their recordables are and so
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
under there's two statutes so
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
281 2 RSA 281 A- 53 requires all
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
employers both public and private to
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
report all injuries regardless of
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
severity to the department within 5 days
 
01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
of that injur or alleged injury sorry
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
alleged injury from um whether you know
 
01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
to the department uh they can do that
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
either directly to us or via their
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
carrier even if they choose to go via
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
their carrier they're supposed to report
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
that to us my safety inspectors farm
 
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
that data when they before they go out
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
for an just a regular inspection even a
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
complaint generated inspection they're
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
looking at that data to see what their
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
injury rate what are they seeing most
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
commonly at that employer's location the
 
01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
other statues
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
27715 littleb that one requires all
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
public employers to report serious
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
bodily injuries so injuries or death so
 
01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
at a minimum injuries requiring an
 
01:16:34.350 --> 01:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
overnight stay in a hospital to the
 
01:16:36.189 --> 01:16:36.199 align:start position:0%
department for which for which we would
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
look at analyze and determine whether or
 
01:16:40.030 --> 01:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
not a you know an investigation needs to
 
01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:40.950 align:start position:0%
not a you know an investigation needs to
take

01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
place follow so that sorry that has to
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
be done uh within oh gosh I think it's
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
24 hours for a death and or eight hours
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the death and 24 hours but there is
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
a time frame that's much shorter than
 
01:16:58.229 --> 01:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
the 5 days sorry Sor right so if I
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to report of all of the accidents
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
that happened in the Department of Labor
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
last year would I be able to get that
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
from the data that you guys are
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
collecting a report for all of the
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
incidents that happened last year all in
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
So within a certain department so we can
 
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
um oh a certain Department yes you can
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
we can generate um because we do each
 
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
one is saved via code um now will it be
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
you know specifically detailed we would
 
01:17:24.310 --> 01:17:24.320 align:start position:0%
then go in and you know if we need to
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
and read them but yes so gener like you
 
01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
would see all the lower back injuries
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
just right just statistical data numbers
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you Mr chairman um some
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
of this is in 277 that are already in
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
law some of this will be in your rules
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
should we look at more having less rules
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
and more of it stated within the
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
statutes that way people are clearer on
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
what they need to follow and whatnot
 
01:18:02.629 --> 01:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
instead of having whole wholesale 1400
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
become a behemoth and then have the
 
01:18:10.149 --> 01:18:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
specific I mean there's both would have
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
the same you know rules have the effect
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
of law there are laws um I I think it's
 
01:18:22.629 --> 01:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not I think they they could both get
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
ch same place one just takes longer it
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
would it also be true that if um if it's
 
01:18:32.990 --> 01:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
in rules and the oosha standards get
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
adjusted you have the authority
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
immediately to um adjust your rules
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
rather than have wait for a new statute
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
you motion I want to talk about a time
 
01:18:55.629 --> 01:18:55.639 align:start position:0%
our schedule here first okay right we
 
01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
have to report everything out by
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
Thursday November 2nd correct sounds
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
great so we have um to
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
have one last final meeting to discuss
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
our four or of the labor committee to
 
01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
discuss the four bills we have to vote
 
01:19:16.950 --> 01:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
them in exact session correct yep right
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
and it is kind of my opinion um that we
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
should have the entire committee
 
01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
here to have an opportunity to
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
understand I don't know I'm thinking out
 
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
understand I don't know I'm thinking out
loud

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
loud
 
01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
here if we have our exec session prior
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
to executing this bill I think you're
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
going to need some kind of it's going to
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
take there's going to be a lot of
 
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
questions I'm guessing by the entire
 
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.510 align:start position:0%
questions I'm guessing by the entire
committee

01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
so we have something we pick a date for
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
the executive session back back it up an
 
01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:53.560 align:start position:0%
hour prior to that
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
to have the discussion on this one in
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
particular the other ones everyone knows
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
how they're going to vote already for
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
right they all agree Y and the other
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
three bills that we have in front of us
 
01:20:04.910 --> 01:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
and and the labor committee everyone's
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
going to everyone pretty much knows you
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
have an amendment coming in you know so
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
everything's going to be pretty simple
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
on the three of them we you and I have
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
gotten into this a lot more the
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee has gotten into it a little
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
further some of our other members don't
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
have a clue what we've been up to we
 
01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
take it um so I'm just looking at the
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
Timeline here as to what you want to do
 
01:20:28.750 --> 01:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
now I was I would wanted initially to do
 
01:20:32.350 --> 01:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
this the 26th Thursday the 26th yeah but
 
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
that but now we have veto day um so we
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't know that pardon well because we
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
don't know you know we only have what
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
five bills right you know um we don't
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
know how long the Senate's going
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
to I heard I heard somebody um suggest
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
that we ought to be done by three
 
01:20:55.830 --> 01:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
three I I think that's being very
 
01:20:57.149 --> 01:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
generous I think so good because we're
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
waiting how many are on the Senate we
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the
 
01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.270 align:start position:0%
have to wait for the
Senate

01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so do you want to do it after or do
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
it has to be the day before be getting
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
people up here on the 25th and I don't
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
think people want to be here two days uh
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we're going to have
 
01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
everything prepared by the 19th
 
01:21:27.709 --> 01:21:27.719 align:start position:0%
um to do it next Thursday with everybody
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%

for an exec session no no I'm talking on
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
Monday you don't want to do you want to
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
do the exec session on Thursday and a
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
preview on Monday
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
correct I was hoping to do them the same
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
day that see I would I would rather have
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
people come in here at at 10 o'clock in
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the morning have one hour of discussion
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the OSHA thing and then at 11 o'clock
 
01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
we start our executive
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
session that would work with me frankly
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
you could build the whole thing into EXA
 
01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
session just leave a lot of time for the
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
ocean correct right uh um I was hoping
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
to do it only an hour before just so um
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
if people could really some people won't
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
show up some people aren't going to Care
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
some of the ones really want to dig into
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
it that's we're going to want to have
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
full 20 we'll have to have 20 people
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
here for an exact session right right so
 
01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
people aren't showing up no but I'm
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
talking about doing it if they wanted to
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
what I don't want to do is I don't want
 
01:23:23.709 --> 01:23:23.719 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half long exec session
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
just on this bill it would be nice if we
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
got to exec session we did what we're
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to do in exec session it last
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
15 or 20 minutes and get it done so
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to have something as
 
01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.430 align:start position:0%
that's why I wanted to have something as
a

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
preview before then and I was hoping to
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%

minutes puts me outside lunch two o'
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
gets me that's why I was asking you what
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
time you said
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon two okay
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
24th that will be our exec session for
 
01:26:02.590 --> 01:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
all four
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
remaining and two o' two o'clock will be
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
by discussion of otion yeah and then 3
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:23.950 align:start position:0%
 
fine

01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:26:26.470 --> 01:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
what I would like however is to have a
 
01:26:28.629 --> 01:26:28.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation from this committee going
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
in so um I think at this point it would
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
be um uh appropriate to have a motion
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee to uh um to do
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
something and I would suggest the motion
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
should be to to adopt option
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
two and and before we get to that exec
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
session obviously we need an official
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment but uh I think I think what
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
we've got now drafted by the department
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
of labor attorneys um is specific enough
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
and I expect that OS will just dress it
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
up in their format um so I don't I it's
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be much
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
different um representative Sullivan I
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
will support your
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
motion subject to seeing obviously the
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and I am going to discuss this
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
obviously with I have discussed this
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
with my leadership um option two and
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
some of things but to move it forward
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
um in the position here uh because I I
 
01:27:27.149 --> 01:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
don't I would be voting against option
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
one at this point all right so uh I will
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
support option two subject to you know a
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
few caveats of seeing the
 
01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.390 align:start position:0%
few caveats of seeing the
final

01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
um um amendments and what have you
 
01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative Susi do we have a
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
motion make it what you
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
said okay motion by um representative
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
Susi do we have a
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
second if you want
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
discussion you want to
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
see I yeah I just I I would hate to see
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
us wait for the uh the amendment but of
 
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
course um all bets are off if the
 
01:28:12.669 --> 01:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
amendment comes up uh very different
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
from what we're talking about so thank
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%

recommendation for the committee um I
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
would like to thank the committee I
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
would especially like to thank the
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
department and um I'm
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh encouraged with where we're at and
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
I I agree with uh representative
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
infantine that um this is something that
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
I believe we can um sell to the Senate
 
01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:21.800 align:start position:0%
once we get it past our house of course
 
01:29:25.229 --> 01:29:25.239 align:start position:0%
uh um but um I think we're moving in the
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
right direction so thank you
 
01:29:30.510 --> 01:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
everyone before we leave we just said
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
this that in reading a recent uh press
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
release from the insurance department
 
01:29:40.990 --> 01:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
your microphone's off congratulated
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
should be congratulated the Department
 
01:29:46.109 --> 01:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
of Labor for the impact that the work
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
your work has had on the rates in New
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the past uh 12 years the
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
rate has come down
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
63% so that's that's a major uh that was
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
the intent when this was passed to
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
reduce the uh injuries for people and to
 
01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the rate for employers and this
 
01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:05.119 align:start position:0%
is another step in that direction so
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work that you've done
 
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
over the years to make that happen thank
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
