after which
 
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
unless the committee keeps the iso New
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
England Representatives here through

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
break from 12 to 1 and then at one
 
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.830 align:start position:0%
break from 12 to 1 and then at one
o'clock

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
we'll have a presentation from the New
 
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 align:start position:0%
England power Jenners generators
 
00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.950 align:start position:0%
England power Jenners generators
Association

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
Association
 
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
before we begin this morning however I
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
have a couple of
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh administrative details to inform the
 
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
public about
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
number one and I'm sure some of you have
 
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
noticed this because we've received a
 
00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
number of complaints the house digital
 
00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:23.510 align:start position:0%
number of complaints the house digital
calendar

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
is not working correctly
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
therefore the
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
the calendar listing on the House
 
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
website for this meeting and at other
 
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 align:start position:0%
meetings around the state house around
 
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
the Legislative Office Building is not
 
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.590 align:start position:0%
the Legislative Office Building is not
correct

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.270 align:start position:0%
correct
and

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
the house administrative Services people
 
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
are well aware of this problem they're
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
working to fix it
 
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
but what it means practically is that
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
you should
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
maybe not rely on the digital calendar
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
until such time as we know it's working
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
correctly and instead
 
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
bring up the pdf version of the printed
 
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
House calendar to
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
find out exactly when meetings are going
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
to happen and what kind of activity will
 
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
take place at those meetings
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
so for example even though you've all on
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
all the members of this committee have
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
received a
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
an email notification of our committee
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
meetings next Monday and Tuesday
 
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
they will be printed in the house
 
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 align:start position:0%
calendar that is printed or that is sent
 
00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
to every member this evening
 
00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 align:start position:0%
so that is the calendar that I would
 
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
rely on if I were you to determine when
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
we're meeting and what we're discussing
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
during those meetings until further
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
notice hopefully the digital calendar
 
00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:55.259 align:start position:0%
will be repaired sooner rather than
 
00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:57.890 align:start position:0%
will be repaired sooner rather than
later

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
another issue that's come up is that
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
last session
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
house administrative Services developed
 
00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:10.259 align:start position:0%
a way for members of the public to
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
submit testimony on bills it uses a
 
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
and once that portal was determined to
 
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
be working correctly
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
which it currently is
 
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.770 align:start position:0%
which it currently is
we

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
the speaker made a policy that we would
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
not accept
 
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
testimony written testimony via email
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
we only accept written testimony via the
 
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.110 align:start position:0%
we only accept written testimony via the
portal

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
portal
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
so if you send testimony to this
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
committee via email
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
while members may see it and choose to
 
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
read it it will not go into the official
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
record for that house bill
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
so if you want your testimony to be in
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
the official record for a house bill you
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
need to submit that testimony through
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
the portal
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
or you can hand deliver that testimony
 
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
to the committee at the time of the
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
I hope that's clear and if you have any
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
questions you can see me after the
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
meeting and we can we can discuss it
 
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.629 align:start position:0%
meeting and we can we can discuss it
then

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
I don't want to take up any further time
 
00:08:25.309 --> 00:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
that we have allotted for a presentation
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
by ISO New England
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
I guess we have a question from
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
representative naughter thank you Mr
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
chairman I was wondering if you could go
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
over the rules again on what is
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate to say ask asking questions
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
and as opposed to make just making
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
comments and
 
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.630 align:start position:0%
comments and
uh

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
speeches okay I'd be happy to do that so
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
just to refresh every member's memory
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're here to gather information
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
we are not here to debate with people
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
who are presenting to us
 
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
we are not here to make comments
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
about what we're hearing we're here to
 
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:11.700 align:start position:0%
ask pertinent questions to gather
 
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.130 align:start position:0%
ask pertinent questions to gather
information

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
so that we can use that information in
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
our decision-making process
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
so when I recognize you to ask a
 
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.949 align:start position:0%
so when I recognize you to ask a
question

00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
the first words out of your mouth should
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
be a question
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
and if the person that you're asking the
 
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
question of needs a clarification of the
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
question they will probably request it
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
and at that point you could provide said
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
clarification if necessary
 
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
but we don't want to see
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
two-minute expositions prior to the
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
issuance of a question that wastes
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
everyone's time and doesn't lead to good
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
answers to questions so think about the
 
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
questions you're going to ask
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
ahead of time and try to formulate them
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to extract good
 
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.329 align:start position:0%
in such a way as to extract good
information

00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:02.339 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
try not to bias the question by making a
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
comment ahead of time
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
we want to get information we don't want
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
to get we don't want to lead people to
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
answer is that we hope they will provide
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
so I hope that's clear I hope that
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:25.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
so you know other questions we'll move
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
on and introduce
 
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:33.000 align:start position:0%

England and Kerry please correct my
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
pronunciation if I got that wrong
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
and Melissa Winnie State policy advisor
 
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:45.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
these young ladies have agreed to travel
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
week ago and he is still in covet
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
protocol so he was unable to join us
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
here this morning
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
overview of what ISO New England does
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
and that we'll be able to ask them
 
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:15.500 align:start position:0%
questions to get additional information
 
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
so with that I will turn the microphone
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
over to Ms schlinkding schlichting that
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
is a slightly difficult name
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
Kerry's fine thank you okay to Carrie
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
and Melissa thank you go ahead
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
thank you all for having us today and
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you for the introductions Eric
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
wishes he could be your hair as well but
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
we are glad to be here and we work
 
00:11:41.569 --> 00:11:41.579 align:start position:0%
directly with Eric at the iso and are
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
here to answer all of your questions as
 
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
we go through our materials so if it
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
works for the chair if you have
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
questions throughout the presentation to
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand at the time and
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
today we're going to be covering a few
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
basics of about the power system and ISO
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
New England as well as looking at the
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
power the markets in the New England
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
region the work that the iso is doing in
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
our system planning planning ahead and
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
looking at what the changing resource
 
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
mix and changing energy grid looks like
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
in New England and then we have a
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
variety of resources that we have linked
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
for that are in the Powerpoints that we
 
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:24.180 align:start position:0%
will share the electronic version after
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
this for additional resources
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
so I assume New England we in our role
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
is to plan the transmission grid and
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
system and administer the Region's
 
00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets and operate the power
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
system to ensure a reliable and
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
competitively priced wholesale
 
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.110 align:start position:0%
competitively priced wholesale
electricity

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
that's our mission that is the values
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
that govern our day-to-day activities
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
and when we think about our vision this
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
is where we are going this is where ISO
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
is a collaborator and a stakeholder with
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
the New England states to help them
 
00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
achieve their policy goals in the region
 
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
while also ensuring that we make we stay
 
00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:12.959 align:start position:0%
true to our mission and our our course
 
00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:16.019 align:start position:0%
of reliability in the region so we are
 
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540 align:start position:0%
looking forward to what that mean what
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
the future will look like and how we
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
maintain our requirements within that
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:30.660 align:start position:0%
um ISO in New England has more than two
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
decades of experience overseeing the
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
Region's restructured electric power
 
00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
system we are regulated by the Federal
 
00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory Commission for the
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
ferc in Washington DC
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
we are the reliability coordinator for
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
New England under the North American
 
00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180 align:start position:0%
Electric reliability Corporation and
 
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
it's always important for us to
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we are independent of
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
companies in the marketplace and neutral
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
on technology that means that the ice
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
everyone who works at ISO New England
 
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
has divested of any personal investments
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
in energy companies and Technologies and
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
it means that we for when we plan and
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
operate our system we are technology
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
neutral or fuel neutral we are systeming
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
what we call economic dispatch which
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
we'll talk more about but we are looking
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
to run the power system without any
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
Prejudice or preference to certain types
 
00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
of resources
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
yes may I interrupt you for a quick
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
question could you clarify the
 
00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.139 align:start position:0%
the difference between ferc and nerc who
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
reports to who
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
is ISO New England report to of those
 
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:42.500 align:start position:0%
two uh how does that relationship work
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
ferc is our federal regulator the
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process in New England to
 
00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
ferc for their approval and then those
 
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
are made so those are our legally
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
binding guidelines of how we run the
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
power system we have responsibilities to
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
nerc as a reliability coordinator that
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
has a variety of operational
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
requirements and standards that we have
 
00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
to meet from an operational perspective
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
to maintain reliability and those types
 
00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:14.150 align:start position:0%
to maintain reliability and those types
of

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
those are more operationally focused in
 
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
when we think about the types of
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
reserves that we have online 10 minutes
 
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:24.180 align:start position:0%
or 30 minutes or the amount of surplus
 
00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
that or that we have in a day when we
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
think about ferc they are overseeing all
 
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
of our markets development all of our
 
00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
our budget as the iso all of the
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
operational aspects that the iso does
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
across all of our functions
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up you do have to get
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
permission from ferc to do certain
 
00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
things correct but you don't have to get
 
00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:50.339 align:start position:0%
permission from nerc nerc establishes
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have to meet
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
from an operational perspective
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yes okay
 
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas as a
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up I suspect
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you not quite a follow-up just
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
another question along the same lines of
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
your briefing
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm a little confused tell me how how
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
how do you mean that that ISO is neutral
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
on fuel fuel how does that work so when
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
we plan and operate the power system we
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
do not dispatch any units based on the
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
their fuel type there's no preference in
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
order of dispatch it is based on a price
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
in the market so any dispatch of units
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
is based on the value that they have
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
offered into the market system so we
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
call this an economic dispatch that
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
ensures that the cheapest less expensive
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
resources are being dispatched first so
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
a for an alternative to look at it you
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
could say that you wanted that all
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear generators were dispatched first
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
and then all of the oil dinners and then
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
all the wind generators but that would
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
be a different type of system you'd be
 
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
favoring or prefer have preference for a
 
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
source where this is all based on the
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
price that any resource has entered in
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
to the market regardless of what type of
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
generator they are
 
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:18.890 align:start position:0%
generator they are
follow-up

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:18.900 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr for the follow-up
 
00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:23.569 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr for the follow-up
so

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:23.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
in that case then our
 
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
all fuel types generators uh
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
equally uh bidding into the market so uh
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
there's there's no heavier weight than
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:42.620 align:start position:0%
correct there are different
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
characteristics of the resources which
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
allow them to bid certain amounts of
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
power into the system for example us
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's a solar facility has a different
 
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:55.860 align:start position:0%
capacity rating than a Nuclear
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
Generating facility so there's when
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're entering in their bids they're
 
00:18:01.789 --> 00:18:01.799 align:start position:0%
allowed to put only so much energy into
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
their bid based on the type of resource
 
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense for example we know
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
on a cloudy day solar can't bid their
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
full amount in to the system they can't
 
00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:13.020 align:start position:0%
be dispatched so there's a capacity
 
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
Factor that's applied to the specific
 
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.130 align:start position:0%
Factor that's applied to the specific
resource

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
resource
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
but and we also we know that summer
 
00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:20.820 align:start position:0%
versus winter different types of
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
uh generators have different operating
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
capacities based on if it's really hot
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
or if it's really cold that can affect
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
the amount of power that they are
 
00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
eligible to bid in but once they have
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
been in at their price the it's they are
 
00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:36.260 align:start position:0%
just dispatched based on their price
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
Reynolds this has a question thank you
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman this is actually following
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
up on the Chairman's inquiry about
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
the distinction difference between ferc
 
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
and nerc would it be correct to
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
understand that the ferc is a is the
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
federal government it's a regulatory
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
agency of the federal government it is
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
charged with issuing and enforcing the
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
uh regulations that Implement federal
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
law so like the energy Policy Act uh
 
00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:10.700 align:start position:0%
like other energy
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
acts laws passed by Congress while
 
00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:19.320 align:start position:0%
nerc is an industry created cooperative
 
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.930 align:start position:0%
nerc is an industry created cooperative
organization

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
to uh whose goal is to
 
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.090 align:start position:0%
to uh whose goal is to
support

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:26.990 align:start position:0%
support
um

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
private organizations like yours and
 
00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:32.220 align:start position:0%
grid operators and our neighboring grid
 
00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:35.299 align:start position:0%
is of course as people have told us pjm
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
and so help the industry operate to
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
ensure reliability throughout
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
regions throughout the country yes nerc
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
is more than just ISO New England where
 
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:47.780 align:start position:0%
right ferc is all of all of the country
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
minus some exceptions in the urcot
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
system because they have a different
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
type of jurisdictional agreement
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
for nerc is just as specific subsection
 
00:19:58.909 --> 00:19:58.919 align:start position:0%
of the country and that based on the
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
interconnection the ties and the
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
Reliance on those systems and
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
um if in a minute we'll move to a
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
different slide that will show that in a
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different way but yes
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is a representative a good way to
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
put it thank you
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you what is the most reliable
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
so when we think about the any any type
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
of generator can go offline or be
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
unavailable we we see
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
generators have outages they need
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
repairs scheduled maintenance
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
um so any type of generator can be
 
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
offline at any time but we work on that
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
through us we schedule that for any sort
 
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
of planned outages through the iso when
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
we think about reliability it's more of
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
the the the the commitment that the
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
resources have made within the
 
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
marketplace to provide there's not I
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
can't say that we're we're neutral in a
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
way that we we wouldn't identify that
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
this is the answer versus this is not
 
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
the answer of a resource the different
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
resources have different characteristics
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
that have different values when you
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
think about a system operation for
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
example we have some resources that are
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
fast start resources they can ramp up
 
00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
and be online in 30 minutes and that has
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
a very specific value depending on the
 
00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:21.299 align:start position:0%
time of day or the type of situation on
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
the grid where another type of resource
 
00:21:26.029 --> 00:21:26.039 align:start position:0%
something that's like nuclear they don't
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
ramp up and ramp down they just produce
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
a very steady state of electricity so
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
that has a different type of resource
 
00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:35.220 align:start position:0%
that they offer to the grid there's some
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
resources that can do what we call Black
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
start start from zero turned off all all
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
the way on and that's another type of
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
resource so it's really a compilation of
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
all the different characteristics of
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
these resources that we can talk a
 
00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
little bit more about we have in
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
addition to just our energy markets we
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
have what we call ancillary Services
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
where the different generators provide
 
00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
voltage support and they help with
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
things like frequency which are
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
important to the grid from a different
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
perspective of just pure generation and
 
00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
reliability capacity
 
00:22:06.409 --> 00:22:06.419 align:start position:0%
I know that doesn't quite that does not
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
directly answer what you're asking but
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
from our perspective I I can't tell you
 
00:22:12.409 --> 00:22:12.419 align:start position:0%
that the one is superior over the other
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
because of the way we look at it of a
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
technology neutral
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um my question is
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
actually on the neutrality of rates and
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
and rate providers and this actually
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
ties to the the minimum offer price Rule
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
moper and Casper
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
um how is price affected by the minimum
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
office offer price Rule and uh how much
 
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
have Advocate State policies influence
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
the rates that we currently have
 
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
if it's possible that I we make a note
 
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
of what the moper is and provide a
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
little bit more background we're going
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
to go through some of the different
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
markets that the iso has including the
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
Ford capacity Market which is where the
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
moper falls in and if we could make a
 
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
note to address that when we get to that
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
slides if that's all right
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative that's fine kind of
 
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.029 align:start position:0%
representative that's fine kind of
follow-up

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up just on uh the minimum
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
offer price rule
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
um tie to that does it in fact influence
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
the rate that is charged
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
the minimum offer price rule is part of
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
the Ford capacity auction which is run
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
every year and it it influences the
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
types of resources that can clear in the
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
market so in the sense that it is part
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
of the mecca the market clearing
 
00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
mechanism which is the value for the the
 
00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
wholesale price through the capacity
 
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
Market it does have a there is an
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
influence on that but that is only part
 
00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the markets it's not part of the day
 
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
ahead energy Market or the real-time
 
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
energy Market nor the ancillary Services
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
markets so while yes it does have an
 
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
impact on the values of the forward
 
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
capacity auction and what clears in that
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's not related to the other markets of
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
the iso feel free to wait until you get
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
to that part of the program sorry I
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
realized I just jumped into quite a bit
 
00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:58.700 align:start position:0%
of acronyms thank you okay
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
joining us can you uh describe your your
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
ownership structure I mean are you a
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
non-profit are you a corporation and and
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
what's the composition of the board of
 
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.510 align:start position:0%
what's the composition of the board of
directors

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
directors
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just skip to a slide and
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
then we'll go back to the one we passed
 
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
because this directly uh answers your
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
question I can I can wait okay well is
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
so before we jump into is it all right
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
to continue on yes please continue
 
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.289 align:start position:0%
to continue on yes please continue
um

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:33.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
before we jump into our oversight we we
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
have three critical roles per our tariff
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
which is our governing body under for
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
ferc we are responsible for grid
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
operation so that is day-to-day managing
 
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
of the power system keeping the lights
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
on 24 hours a day we design run and
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
oversee the markets where wholesale
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
electricity is bought and sold and we
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
are responsible for power system
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
planning and that is studying and
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
analyzing different generation
 
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
interconnection requests and
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
transmission requests as well as the
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
system reliability and system Health to
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
ensure that electricity needs our meat
 
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
are met over the next 10 years and we'll
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
talk more about when we get into the the
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
forward-looking studies how that role is
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
even evolving to farther outlooks in the
 
00:25:20.159 --> 00:25:24.169 align:start position:0%
even evolving to farther outlooks in the
future

00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
so we have to representative is it
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
months uh question there are a variety
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
of entities that have oversight over ISO
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
New England we are a not-for-profit
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
um we are overseen by ferc as our
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
federal regulator we have as well as the
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
Northeast power coordinating Council and
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
North American Electric liability
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
corporation which is nerc as we talked
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
to for some of the reliability
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
requirements from an operational
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
perspective and we have an independent
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
board of directors which are selected
 
00:25:58.190 --> 00:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
through an outside search process and
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
provide oversight to the iso we also
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
have we are also part of knee pool
 
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:08.220 align:start position:0%
um which is the regional stakeholders
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
which you can see which are the green
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
group in the center of the slide where
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
there's different sectors of
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
participants in the New England markets
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
that have that participate in
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
stakeholder meetings for on all proposed
 
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:24.900 align:start position:0%
changes to the iso's tariffs and that's
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
where any sort of change or New Market
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
design would go through the stakeholder
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
process and be submitted to ferc for
 
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.710 align:start position:0%
process and be submitted to ferc for
approval

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
um we also have we also work with our
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
New England states in the region we work
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
with Nesco which is a New England State
 
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
Council on a
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
electricity thanks Melissa
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
um as well as we work with our cons the
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
state's consumer Advocates attorney
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
generals and policy makers like
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
yourselves the public utility
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
Commissions in the state's environmental
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
regulators and energy agencies these
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
entities do not have direct oversight
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
over the iso because ferc is our
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
regulator but we are partners with those
 
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:10.260 align:start position:0%
or at least all these different entities
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
and work with them in our processes and
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we are transparent and
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
clear to the states of what where we're
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
going and why
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
so representative do you have any
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
this was brought up earlier we are part
 
00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
of a larger Grid in New England the iso
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
six New England states we are directly
 
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.430 align:start position:0%
six New England states we are directly
connected

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
connected
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
um not only to the Quebec CIS power
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
system but to nyso which is the New
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
England I of the New York ISO and it and
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
through the New York ISO to pjm which is
 
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
the Mid-Atlantic and Southern States but
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
electricity electric electrically we are
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
tied all the way almost to the Western
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
the Rocky Mountains on the western side
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
up through Canada and down to the
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
southern parts of the U.S we are their
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
exception being ercot which has a unique
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
structure and is not directly
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
interconnected in the same way to what
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
we call the Eastern interconnect
 
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.070 align:start position:0%
we call the Eastern interconnect
and

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
the 2003 blackout which did not affect
 
00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
this part of New England but was
 
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:18.419 align:start position:0%
directly felt all in the southwestern
 
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
Connecticut was when there was a power
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
outage in the Ohio region that within 10
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
10 seconds cascaded Eastward and caused
 
00:28:27.289 --> 00:28:27.299 align:start position:0%
a power outage all along the Eastern
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
Seaboard and that level of an outage was
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
really unprecedented at the time and as
 
00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860 align:start position:0%
a result in 2003 nerc and npcc
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
undertook a big stakeholder process to
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
create a regional set of requirements
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
for reliability that really emphasize
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
the communication between the different
 
00:28:50.269 --> 00:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
isos in the region
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh can you speak
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
about the implications of the
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
differences between AC and DC
 
00:29:00.299 --> 00:29:01.610 align:start position:0%
differences between AC and DC
transmission

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:02.690 align:start position:0%
transmission
sure

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:02.700 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
this slide here on the next slide shows
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
our different AC and DC interconnections
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the New England region so AC is an
 
00:29:12.289 --> 00:29:12.299 align:start position:0%
alternating current and DC is a direct
 
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460 align:start position:0%
current that means it has they have
 
00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.029 align:start position:0%
current that means it has they have
different

00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:17.990 align:start position:0%
different
characteristics

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
characteristics
 
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.510 align:start position:0%
characteristics
um

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
not saying one or the other is preferred
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
or non-preferred but they we have both
 
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
types of inter Corrections in a direct
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
current means that everything is flowing
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
in one way at the time and to so it is
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
possible to switch and gold power back
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
but it cannot alternate back and forth
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
so when we have our direct current
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
interconnections there the power is
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
normally flowing in One Direction and
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
for us we have two DC interconnections
 
00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
in the northern part of our system that
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
are most almost always flowing from
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
Canada into New England we also have one
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
DC connection which we call the cross
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
sound cable that connects Connecticut to
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
Long Island
 
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
but the majority of our interconnects in
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
New England to both New Brunswick and
 
00:30:06.769 --> 00:30:06.779 align:start position:0%
New York are AC connections
 
00:30:06.779 --> 00:30:08.090 align:start position:0%
New York are AC connections
follow-up

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm still unclear uh are there
 
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020 align:start position:0%
differences in terms of of transmission
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
capability I mean why would one be
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
preferred over another for a specific
 
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.430 align:start position:0%
preferred over another for a specific
application

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not an engineer but I will do
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
my best to answer this question I'm
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
happy to follow up from an engineering
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
perspective my understanding is that the
 
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
direct current allows for larger amounts
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
of energy to be
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh distributed over the lines where ac
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
lines are typically smaller sized
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
systems but that from a their the
 
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:43.919 align:start position:0%
benefit or the a pro of an AC is its
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
ability to switch back and forth and go
 
00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:47.940 align:start position:0%
back and forth between with where the
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
direct current is really more of a
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
one-way Direction
 
00:30:54.649 --> 00:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
so it's just a pro it's what the the
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
line is capable of versus a preference
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
for one or the other
 
00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of published information
 
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:05.220 align:start position:0%
about the difference between AC and DC
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
continue thank you thank you sorry I'm
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
best I can do on that one
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
um but it is to note that
 
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
um in the region we do import about 16
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
of our energy needs
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
um and our last full data that we have
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
from 2021 was about 16 and we'll be
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
getting our new 2022 cumulative numbers
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
um but the majority of that does come
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
from Hydro Quebec
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
so New England is what we would call a
 
00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
summer peaking system which is when we
 
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:41.820 align:start position:0%
see our highest demand of load on the
 
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.130 align:start position:0%
see our highest demand of load on the
system

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
um and this is this is largely due to
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
the use of air conditioning in New
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
England we see the highest amount of
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
Demand on the the hottest muggiest day
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
humidity is a large driving factor and
 
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:56.700 align:start position:0%
in load
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and that a normal summer day we see
 
00:32:02.269 --> 00:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
peaks of about 17 000 megawatts to 22
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts
 
00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
but that our all-time Regional High for
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
the summer was over 28 000 megawatts and
 
00:32:12.529 --> 00:32:12.539 align:start position:0%
instead and we have not seen numbers
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
approaching that high in the region due
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
directly to the Investments of Energy
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and solar PV in the region
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
those are have been significant
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
Investments made by the states that have
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
really reduced the overall Peak and the
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
overall demand in the region
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have a we have a lower peak in the
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
winter but different fuel constraints
 
00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:34.919 align:start position:0%
based on the types of generating
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
resources that we will speak to more in
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
further slides
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
but we do anticipate that in some of our
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
our work that we are doing on what the
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
evolution of the grid looks like that we
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
will switch back to a winter peaking
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
system in the winter to be a peaking
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
system in the winter in the future and
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
that will be due to the electrification
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
of of heating demand but then all-time
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
winter Peak was also quite a few years
 
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
um this is really interesting and one of
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
the things that jumps out to me is
 
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740 align:start position:0%
given economic growth and population
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
growth in
 
00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:27.500 align:start position:0%
the region New England
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of decades why can
 
00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:32.509 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of decades why can
you

00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:32.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:33.289 align:start position:0%
you
um

00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
why can you state why perhaps the
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
all-time Peak Regional demand would have
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
occurred way back 18 years ago in 2006.
 
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's directly due to the investment
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
of Energy Efficiency and behind the
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
meter solar PV and we have a slide
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
further in the deck that will illustrate
 
00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:57.059 align:start position:0%
over the how that curve has how that how
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
those affect the overall demand if we
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
can come back to that terrific thank you
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
but it that it I can tell you it is
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency in behind the meter
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
solar PV
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to pass it to
 
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
Melissa for the next set of slides
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
great thank you Carrie hello everyone
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
um so I will be speaking today's tour uh
 
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:23.700 align:start position:0%
some more information about our markets
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
and the power system as a whole
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
including some more information about
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
the generation that's currently on the
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
system and and what we expect to see
 
00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:34.430 align:start position:0%
system and and what we expect to see
coming

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so we have 350 different dispatchable
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
generators in the region and that uh
 
00:34:43.849 --> 00:34:43.859 align:start position:0%
equates to 31 500 megawatts of
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
generating capacity I'm going to talk a
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
bit more we have a few slides on the
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
generation that we currently have
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
proposed in the iso queue as well as a
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
little bit more information about the
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
generation that we've seen retire
 
00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:02.339 align:start position:0%
recently of note here we do have active
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
demand response as well as Energy
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
Efficiency participating in our forward
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
capacity market and and that is in part
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
due to some changes that were made in
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
recent years that kind of allow
 
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:16.460 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities for those
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
to participate as capacity in the market
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
so again I'll provide some more
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
information on those other bullets in
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
the next couple slides
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair for thank
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so this
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
slide you just just went over
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
and I perhaps I I misunderstand but
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
could you be more specific when you say
 
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
when you say dispatchable generation do
 
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
you mean like Baseline and also when you
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
say that there's just 31 000 megawatts
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
of generating capacity is that
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
dispatchable is it is it Baseline uh can
 
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
you further Define those because I think
 
00:35:57.890 --> 00:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
that's kind of murky there
 
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.150 align:start position:0%
that's kind of murky there
sure

00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:02.099 align:start position:0%
they're a dispatchable generator means
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
that the control room can contact that
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
plant electronically or manually and say
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
we need you to turn on now so that it's
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
not like say a solar installation or an
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
a wind uh plant that they operate when
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
they can based on the resources that are
 
00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:22.740 align:start position:0%
available so a dispatchable generator is
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
something that can be called upon
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to respond to the control
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
room operators so there's many many more
 
00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
when we think about what is a generator
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
in the region that's part of our system
 
00:36:35.650 --> 00:36:35.660 align:start position:0%
that we would not consider dispatchable
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
there are we are seeing changes to these
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
types of resources where the future the
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
the evolution of batteries have really
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be changing what we
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
consider as a as dispatchable there'll
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
be different types of resources that are
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
coming online but this is more what you
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
would think of as
 
00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:55.619 align:start position:0%
a natural gas facility a nuclear
 
00:36:55.619 --> 00:36:57.290 align:start position:0%
a natural gas facility a nuclear
facility

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
more of a traditional generator the word
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
that the term Baseline is the is the
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
idea they they run all the time and are
 
00:37:08.569 --> 00:37:08.579 align:start position:0%
available to operation and as a as a
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
power system we that that notion is
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
beginning to change because of the types
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
of resources that are coming online
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
where in the past it was coal oil and
 
00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
nuclear and natural gas where they were
 
00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
kind of always available and the
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
intermittency of new resources is is
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
changing how we think about what's
 
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.030 align:start position:0%
changing how we think about what's
available

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
but that's that is correct and the
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
generating capacity includes
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
all other types of resources like demand
 
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:35.460 align:start position:0%
response or active demand or passive
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
demand response as well as solar and
 
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:41.220 align:start position:0%
wind that offer megawatts to the grid
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
but may not necessarily be dispatchable
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the same way
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
our Baseline and base load
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
interchangeable terms yes okay thank you
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so the 350
 
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh dispatchable generators what is their
 
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
megawatt capacity you have 31 uh 500 for
 
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.140 align:start position:0%
total including solar and wind and
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
whatnot but subtract that out what's
 
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
available that is a great question that
 
00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to off the top
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
of my head representative but we will
 
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:18.900 align:start position:0%
follow up with the committee afterwards
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
I just have to look it up in my
 
00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question uh
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
my question uh dispatchable generators
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
that had bidded
 
00:38:38.329 --> 00:38:38.339 align:start position:0%
and they're ready to produce
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
this is going to write a liability
 
00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:47.180 align:start position:0%
is there any information on how many
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
asks for temporary
 
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:52.380 align:start position:0%
offline because of a on
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
something that happened is that
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
information available on the types of
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
generators thank you that's interesting
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
I am not sure what is publicly available
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
I know art from an operational
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
perspective we do have that information
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
but we are governed by an information
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
policy at the iso we're we are limited
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the types of information and the
 
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
types of identifying information we can
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
share to prevent any sort of Market
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
manipulation by competitive uh
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
generators but if it's something that is
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
publicly available I will look and see
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
one more question from representative
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
Doug Thomas
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
may I just have as a follow-up we do
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
every day put out information in our
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
morning reports about
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
cumulative outages but it's not broken
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
down specifically by fuel type of or
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
type of generate if that's what you're
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
asking so okay thank you
 
00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.210 align:start position:0%
asking so okay thank you
thank you

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
um on your
 
00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
subject here on 30 000 megawatts of
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
proposed generation
 
00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.750 align:start position:0%
proposed generation
realistically

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
realistically
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
how much how much of that do you believe
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
will actually get
 
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.089 align:start position:0%
will actually get
built

00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:04.020 align:start position:0%
I will just say there is a level of
 
00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
attrition that happens in the queue
 
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and so the expectation wouldn't be
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
for all of the generators and uh
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
transmission that's in the queue to be
 
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.329 align:start position:0%
transmission that's in the queue to be
built

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:40:14.339 --> 00:40:15.589 align:start position:0%
built
um

00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
and if if I may add on to what Melissa
 
00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
said it depends on it it depends it
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
varies at some points we've seen as much
 
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.220 align:start position:0%
as 70 percent attrition in the past of
 
00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
projects that are looking because many
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
times these are projects that have
 
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.290 align:start position:0%
times these are projects that have
interconnected

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
interconnected
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
one project with multiple
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
interconnection points so there are
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're looking at hedging from an
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
economic perspective development which
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
spot is the best for their a proposed
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
project or their projects that are
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
looking to interconnect in hopes that
 
00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:44.820 align:start position:0%
they'll be picked into a state
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
solicitation for a clean energy and then
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
when they're not they withdraw so the
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
Dynamics of the Q attrition change based
 
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:55.460 align:start position:0%
on well Global economics is also a
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
significant change in how often we see
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
projects leaving but when for example
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
a Connecticut issues and RFP for they
 
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:05.579 align:start position:0%
just issued one for batteries and we've
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
seen like
 
00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:09.660 align:start position:0%
dozens of projects look to interconnect
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
in the queue in direct response to that
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
state policy driver so it varies based
 
00:41:16.069 --> 00:41:16.079 align:start position:0%
on what's happening in the states and
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question I noticed the the 30
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts in the queue and you say
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's mostly wind solar and storage and
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know historically never been 100 in
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
the queue as you just mentioned but
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
even if half of that gets billed we're
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
talking about a lot of new transmission
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
because obviously building power plants
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
wind solar whatever it is doesn't do any
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
good if you can't get the power to where
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be consumed now given the
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
history of New England's recent history
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
00:41:52.790 --> 00:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh Northern Pass which was you know
 
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars was
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
spent and nothing was built we have the
 
00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
present thing going on in Maine where
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
they got all their permits and then the
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
legislature they had a referendum
 
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
petition it was overread does the iso
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
have any plan going forward to try to
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
work with the states to change siding
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
requirements so that transmission can
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
actually be built rather than simply no
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
one's going to build the power plants
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
without the transmission
 
00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:20.339 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question the iso has
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
no authority over States citing
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's exclusively the
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
domain of the states so our role is to
 
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
do the engineering and technical
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
analysis that for the interconnection
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
but in the end what plants are built or
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
what transmission is built in the states
 
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
is is left up to the states
 
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:42:44.329 --> 00:42:44.339 align:start position:0%
I I understand that they don't have any
 
00:42:47.089 --> 00:42:47.099 align:start position:0%
authority to cite regulation site
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
transmission uh but what I'm asking is
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
is the iso going to be looking out and
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
saying okay we're going to be
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
electrifying a lot we've got this plan
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
for all sorts of electric cars electric
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
heat with the demand for electricity is
 
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
going to probably in the next 20 25
 
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:04.740 align:start position:0%
years they're talking about doubling the
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
demand so is there a plan to put out
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
there and say what do we need to do to
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
get this happen we need to have all
 
00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
sorts of transmission so to put the onus
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
back on the states to say you have to do
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
this or we won't build any of this stuff
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
yes I thank you for the clarification we
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually have a transmission 2050 study
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
that we'll talk about at the end of our
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
presentation that explicitly dress
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
addresses that question and I would like
 
00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:32.339 align:start position:0%
to note that from the iso's perspective
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
and for transmission we do have certain
 
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
Authority for a reliability need to have
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
Pro to request an RFP for transmission
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
for reliability for the region which is
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
different from a public policy
 
00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
requirement to interconnect clean energy
 
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
that the states May pursue so there that
 
00:43:52.609 --> 00:43:52.619 align:start position:0%
is a different avenue which we'll also
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit more when we get to
 
00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
the transmission planning system of our
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
prep our presentation but I've made a
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
note to come back to that
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
great may I make a suggestion to the
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee here that many
 
00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
of the questions that you're asking
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
right now will probably be answered by a
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
slide later on in this presentation so
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
let's think seriously about withholding
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
your questions uh we're only about a
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
third of the way through this
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
presentation so let's let's withhold
 
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
some of the questions until we get a
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
little farther along is that okay with
 
00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.510 align:start position:0%
little farther along is that okay with
everybody

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
great so I mentioned on the last slide
 
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.970 align:start position:0%
great so I mentioned on the last slide
that

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
that some retirements of generation
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
since 2013 we've seen 7000 megawatts of
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
generation retire or announced plans for
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
retirement these are predominantly coal
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
oil and nuclear resources and we
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
anticipate about another 5 000 megawatts
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
of the remaining coal and oil resources
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
at risk for retirement this is in in
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
part because of the New England states
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
policies of working towards pursuing
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
more clean energy rather than continuing
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
to refurbish these sorts of fossil fuel
 
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
to refurbish these sorts of fossil fuel
generators

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
generators
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
um they have these types of generators
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
have historically played an important
 
00:45:19.809 --> 00:45:19.819 align:start position:0%
role in uh our winter season
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
particularly when natural gas supplies
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
are constrained in the region
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and so that is a
 
00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
a factor that we need to think about as
 
00:45:31.609 --> 00:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
these plants retire and how we're going
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
to meet some of those requirements in
 
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:38.030 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
great so this slide here is showing the
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
types of resources that are providing
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
electricity to the New England grid this
 
00:45:50.329 --> 00:45:50.339 align:start position:0%
is for 2021 and you can see about half
 
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
is from natural gas resources about a
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
quarter is nuclear as Kerry mentioned
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
about 16 percent comes from Imports and
 
00:46:00.589 --> 00:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
then you could see the remaining 10
 
00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
Renewables that hydro and a small amount
 
00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
of coal and oil
 
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:07.790 align:start position:0%
of coal and oil
um

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk a little bit more about
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
how this is continuing to change in the
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
one point about the region being
 
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.930 align:start position:0%
one point about the region being
dependent

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
dependent
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
um as we saw about half on on natural
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
gas is that natural gas is often the
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
marginal resource in terms of our the
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
way that our markets operate and so
 
00:46:29.569 --> 00:46:29.579 align:start position:0%
historically we see wholesale
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
electricity prices uh tending to Trend
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
with the natural gas prices and so this
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
chart here is showing from 2003 to 2022
 
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:40.980 align:start position:0%
and the the light blue line is the
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity and the darker
 
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:45.180 align:start position:0%
blue line is natural gas and this is to
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
show again you know when you're seeing
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas Peaks for various reasons
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
often in the winter time we often see
 
00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity prices Spike as
 
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.010 align:start position:0%
wholesale electricity prices Spike as
well

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.690 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit at a high level
 
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
about the markets so we have three
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
primary markets
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
the first is the energy market and this
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
is the spot market for trading actual
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
electricity production and there's two
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
components of this so we have a day
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
ahead energy Market that is looking at
 
00:47:24.349 --> 00:47:24.359 align:start position:0%
what our projected load is for the next
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
day and uh looking for resources to
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
enter the market to bid in to provide
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
Power for that next day in addition we
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
have a real-time market so that is the
 
00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:37.020 align:start position:0%
day of
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is meeting whatever
 
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
additional load
 
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
um isn't met by resources in that day
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
ahead market so those are both electric
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
energy real production and those
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
fluctuate throughout the day they
 
00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740 align:start position:0%
fluctuate throughout the region for
 
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:56.060 align:start position:0%
various uh various reasons
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
including you know demands constraints
 
00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
on the system the prices of fuel that
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
are being used to to meet the load
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify that real-time versus day
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
ahead Market issue
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
what would cause a real-time market
 
00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:14.819 align:start position:0%
price of thirty dollars a megawatt and a
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
day ahead price of a hundred and thirty
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a megawatt
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
so I will begin to try to answer that
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not an economist
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but there is some hedging of risk
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
that happens in the market so you have
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
both suppliers and those that are
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
purchasing energy to meet load so it's a
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
little bit of a economic condition of
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
just how those players participate in
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
the market
 
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:40.140 align:start position:0%
um there are also things that can happen
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
in real time that might
 
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.030 align:start position:0%
in real time that might
um

00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know require
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
resources to come on quickly or to meet
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
a load that's uh beyond what we had
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
forecasted and because we need the power
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
to meet the load at all times that might
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
cause a real-time market price to be
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
higher and I'll look to carry to fill in
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
and to make sure I understand your
 
00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
question was a high a day ahead high
 
00:49:10.609 --> 00:49:10.619 align:start position:0%
price real-time low price it could also
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
that could be attributed to change in in
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
load What was forecast and what we
 
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
actually saw and a lot of that often has
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
to come with how Renewables are playing
 
00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:24.180 align:start position:0%
if it was forecast to be a really a
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
cloudy day and all of a sudden it was a
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
sunny day and then there's a lot of
 
00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:28.980 align:start position:0%
solar production that you might see
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
real-time load prices drop as an
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
indicator that we need to back down more
 
00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
of a traditional generator so in New
 
00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
England we can have negative prices
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and we have different types of
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
operational scenarios that send that
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
could if even though the real-time price
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
was hot the day ahead price was high the
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
real-time price is low it's a base is
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
the difference of what the operational
 
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
weather could have been that day and the
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
load forecast and how those things all
 
00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
differ from the day ahead to the real
 
00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.329 align:start position:0%
differ from the day ahead to the real
time

00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
great the next Market is the ancillary
 
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
Services Market
 
00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:04.609 align:start position:0%
Services Market
um

00:50:04.609 --> 00:50:04.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to spend as much time on
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
this one it's a it's a smaller
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
proportion of our our markets but this
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that we have things like
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
frequency regulation and voltage support
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
um so these are short-term reliability
 
00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.990 align:start position:0%
um so these are short-term reliability
Services

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
Services
 
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:18.710 align:start position:0%
Services
um

00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
and then the last one oh yep and those
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
are regulated by those are some what we
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
talk about we regulated by nerc as
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
reliability requirements are are
 
00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180 align:start position:0%
addressed by these ancillary services
 
00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
great and the the last Market here is
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity market so this is
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
where we will have a forward capacity
 
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
auction to ensure that we have capacity
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
three years in the future
 
00:50:46.609 --> 00:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
um and this is really to ensure that we
 
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
do have generators that will be
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
available uh online in that three-year
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
period to meet the load
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
and so who provides those ancillary
 
00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.410 align:start position:0%
and so who provides those ancillary
services

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
any type of generating resource in the
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the system can provide those
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
resources as you know as long as they
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
have the characteristics based on their
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
type of resource
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and this is so we had a question
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
about the moper the minimum offer price
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
Rule and the the minimum offer price
 
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
rule is part of the forward capacity
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's a rule of the four capacity Market
 
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
that has been in place and that is in a
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
transition out there are two more
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
auctions so this year's auction in next
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
year's auction which are still run under
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
the with the moper in place and then it
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
is being phased out I mean the the moper
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
is a way that was intended to
 
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
bring in different types of resources
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
that are traditionally a higher cost
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
and allow them to participate in the
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
market and
 
00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:52.500 align:start position:0%
it has been very controversial in the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
region with a opponents saying that it
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
is limiting the ability of renewable
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
resources to enter because they of the
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
the costs that they have
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
through different processes of a
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
qualification for the forward capacity
 
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.130 align:start position:0%
qualification for the forward capacity
auction

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
auction
 
00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:10.990 align:start position:0%
auction
um

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
I we don't have a particular stance on
 
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
that but we have through the knee pull
 
00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process and through ferc the
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
iso is eliminating the moper moving
 
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.930 align:start position:0%
iso is eliminating the moper moving
forward

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:28.609 --> 00:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
so is the moper realistic when many
 
00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:31.020 align:start position:0%
renewable resources receive
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
government subsidies
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't that distort the
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
Market process
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
that is part of what the role of the
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
moper was trying
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
was intended to help
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
address from a market clearing auction
 
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.950 align:start position:0%
address from a market clearing auction
um

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that I'm the best to speak
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
about the intricacies of the why or why
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
not the moper did not did not work or
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
was not intended at that that's really
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
where our our economists are the most
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
but if we have I'm happy to get back
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
with specific answers to the questions
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
about the about the moper
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
okay we'll save that topic for another
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
day I appreciate you're going to spend a
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
lot of time on that I think yes
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Harrington does have
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
a question about it though yeah thank
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
you Miss Jim let me take my question
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
this will be another one maybe you want
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
to add to your follow-up list uh you
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
know in the end of December we had a lot
 
00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:30.780 align:start position:0%
of days we we looked out we saw 40 of
 
00:53:33.950 --> 00:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
the generation was oil and most of these
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
oil plants live off of capacity payments
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
because they don't run very often as you
 
00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:39.780 align:start position:0%
saw in your slide there it's like two
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
percent of our electricity is produced
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
by oil over the course of a year but on
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
certain days of the year like the end of
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
December they were producing a 40 for
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
multiple days now if the when the moper
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
goes away and the capacity prices go
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
down many of these plants I would assume
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
are going to close so what's the iso's
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
uh fix for when these oil plants go away
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
and we have a real cold couple of weeks
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
in December or January uh two or three
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
years from now and like I say you can
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
take put that on your list if you'd
 
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
rather and I can address partially I can
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
address that so there's
 
00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:17.420 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear that the the
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
capacity payments of the forward
 
00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
capacity Market are are those amounts
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
are made three years and ahead for the
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
for that capacity period here of the
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
year when we look at some of the past
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
weather in those times the reason that
 
00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
oil and
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
coal were running was because from an
 
00:54:35.569 --> 00:54:35.579 align:start position:0%
economic Dispatch they were less
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
expensive than the natural gas because
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
the natural gas system is designed was
 
00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:42.059 align:start position:0%
designed for Home Heating in the region
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
so the majority of the gas is under firm
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
contract with home heating delivery
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
services to heat people's homes and
 
00:54:51.589 --> 00:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
businesses so what only whatever Surplus
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
is left over that is not under contract
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
is then available for electric
 
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
generation and because there are 50 of
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
our installed about generators use
 
00:55:01.849 --> 00:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
natural gas the demand and the supply
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
are just out of line so prices Spike and
 
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
because prices Spike from an economic
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
dispatch the oil and coal are less
 
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:10.260 align:start position:0%
expensive and that's in a real-time
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
Market that that is not part of the Ford
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
capacity Market they're they're separate
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
markets and they're different revenue
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
streams so while they are connected in
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
the overall operation of the grid we
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
part of what the studies that we're
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
doing looking ahead into the future is
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
what will be the demand be and what what
 
00:55:29.569 --> 00:55:29.579 align:start position:0%
do we need to think about from a
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
resource reliability perspective of how
 
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
would we meet those types of Demands
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
when those resources retire and there
 
00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:38.700 align:start position:0%
are tools that the iso has
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
for reliability reasons to retain
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
resources we have a reliability must run
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
contract with Mystic which is a
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
generating facility in Eastern
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for to keep them online
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
before they retired for a reliability
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
reasons so there's there's reasons that
 
00:55:56.569 --> 00:55:56.579 align:start position:0%
there's actions we can take for
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
reliability but we can never keep a
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
plant on indefinitely
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
any the plants will retire regardless of
 
00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
you know we could keep them for a year
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
or two but there's no more that we can
 
00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:07.500 align:start position:0%
do for that and that's why we do our
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
long-term planning
 
00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:10.859 align:start position:0%
to help the mark to identify to the
 
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
marketplace what the need will be so
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
that developers and projects see a
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.290 align:start position:0%
 
continue

00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:26.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so we just talked about
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
those three different markets this is
 
00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
showing from 2008 to 2021 uh the share
 
00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:38.940 align:start position:0%
of of those Mark the value of those
 
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:42.660 align:start position:0%
markets so you can see that primarily
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest Market is the energy Market
 
00:56:47.329 --> 00:56:47.339 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned the ancillary Services
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
Market is a smaller portion and then the
 
00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
dark blue on the top is the forward
 
00:57:02.809 --> 00:57:02.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:04.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're gonna move a little bit quickly
 
00:57:07.849 --> 00:57:07.859 align:start position:0%
through some of the slides to try to get
 
00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
to all the material in our presentation
 
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:12.180 align:start position:0%
I apologize if that's all right we can
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
always come back at the end with
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
questions that's fine okay great so just
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
quickly on the slide I'm just going to
 
00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:20.819 align:start position:0%
mention that many of the New England
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
states as I'm sure you're aware are
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
pursuing uh clean energy requirements
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
renewable energy requirements and that
 
00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:29.099 align:start position:0%
is having an impact on the resources
 
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:30.660 align:start position:0%
that are participating in our our
 
00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.390 align:start position:0%
that are participating in our our
markets

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
markets
 
00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh so this chart here is showing that
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
the dark blue on the left is 2000 the
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
year 2000 the generation from each of
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
these different resource types the light
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
blue in the middle is 2021 and then the
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
green on the end is part of a study that
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
we'll talk more about but this is
 
00:57:50.329 --> 00:57:50.339 align:start position:0%
looking at the resources that would be
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
needed to meet the clean energy
 
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:55.500 align:start position:0%
requirements in the region in 2040 so
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
that is a projection not an actual value
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the the key takeaways here are
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
really that between 2000 and 2021 we've
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
seen a great decrease in the amount of
 
00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
oil and coal as we've talked about an
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
increase in natural gas and then you can
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
see the remaining but those are the the
 
00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
two major changes that have happened in
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
um we we mentioned earlier uh that both
 
00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and behind the meter
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
solar has reduced um the load that is uh
 
00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:32.099 align:start position:0%
needed to be met and so you can see here
 
00:58:34.430 --> 00:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
that Top Line is a projection of the
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
load from 2022 to 2031 without any
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
behind the meter solar and Energy
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
Efficiency the yellow line below that is
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
showing the load reduction that is being
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
provided by behind the meter solar and
 
00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.180 align:start position:0%
the green line at the bottom is showing
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
that reduction with solar and Energy
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
Efficiency so the difference between the
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
yellow and the green is the the Energy
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
Efficiency impact
 
00:58:59.339 --> 00:59:01.069 align:start position:0%
Efficiency impact
um

00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I think those are the the major
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit more about load um
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
so while we are seeing those reductions
 
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
from behind the meter solar and Energy
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh as we've talked about
 
00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
before we are anticipating an increase
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
in the overall load because of the
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
efforts towards electrification of both
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
Heating and electric vehicles and so
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
this is showing our projection out to
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
2031 of how many more air source heat
 
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
pumps and electric vehicles we will see
 
00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:37.700 align:start position:0%
in the region
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
understanding that those will overall
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
increase the load that's needed to be
 
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.230 align:start position:0%
increase the load that's needed to be
met

00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
um and there's more information on all
 
00:59:48.289 --> 00:59:48.299 align:start position:0%
of this in the report that's linked on
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
the policies of the New England states
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
were also seeing an impact on our
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue and so here on the
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
left you can see what the
 
01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:04.020 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue was in 2017 and
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
you can see about half of so these are
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
projects that are looking to
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
interconnect and generate on the the
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
grid so in 2017 about half of those were
 
01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
natural gas and then wind and solar and
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
you can see now that within our
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue about half of that
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
is wind followed by battery storage and
 
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
then solar and the chart on the right is
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
looking at the wind specifically and we
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
can see that most of that is projects
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
that are offshore and then a project or
 
01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
the bottom is onshore wind and we're
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
seeing interconnection requests for that
 
01:00:41.089 --> 01:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
in Maine
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
and to add to this the to be part of the
 
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue it because we are
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
a not-for-profit organization it
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
requires Financial commitment from the
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
resources to enter the queue you have to
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
put up a significant amount of money to
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
move on to the next step to be studied
 
01:00:58.329 --> 01:00:58.339 align:start position:0%
requires different amounts of financial
 
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
contributions so these while they are
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
speculative and they are attrition these
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
are serious commitments into the region
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
that are Financial that require
 
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
Financial backup as well when you say
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
someone has to put up money
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
do they give it to ISO New England or do
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
they just create a bond or how do they
 
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
it goes to our settlement process where
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's different levels that are
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
triggered and they the money some of the
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
money it does come to the iso and that's
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
what funds the iso staff to study the
 
01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.809 align:start position:0%
what funds the iso staff to study the
projects

01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
so if you've ever been a consultant you
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
have a project code you'd have a code as
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
an engineer for a very specific project
 
01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:37.619 align:start position:0%
that you're studying that you're you're
 
01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
building your hours to to study that
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
specific project and they're they are
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
paying for the interconnection study
 
01:01:44.339 --> 01:01:46.490 align:start position:0%
paying for the interconnection study
yeah

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative gretian has a question
 
01:01:51.049 --> 01:01:51.059 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thanks for taking my
 
01:01:51.059 --> 01:01:51.770 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thanks for taking my
question

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question about the
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
battery storage projects that are
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
proposed are those mostly lithium ion or
 
01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
are you seeing a diversity of of
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
different approaches
 
01:02:02.809 --> 01:02:02.819 align:start position:0%
um the queue does not specify what type
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
of battery it is some of that is
 
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
proprietary information so we we at this
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
level it is just made that they are the
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
type of generating so it's for us at the
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
public level it's just a battery but I
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
can tell you those are Standalone
 
01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:21.230 align:start position:0%
can tell you those are Standalone
batteries

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you help us
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
understand or I guess unpack the numbers
 
01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
on this slide regarding battery storage
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
solar wind and also I'm referring back
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
to the slide maybe eight slides ago
 
01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
where you showed that
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
when you said 7 000 megawatts of about 7
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts of generation have
 
01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
retarder will retire in the next few
 
01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
years but over 30 000 megawatts of
 
01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:55.740 align:start position:0%
proposed generation is in the queue
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
mostly winds solar and Storage
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
right so our aren't the solar and wind
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
and storage
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
um integrated so I you know what I'm
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
getting at is the industry the renewable
 
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
industry and more and more incorporating
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
storage so that they will overcome the
 
01:03:14.579 --> 01:03:15.950 align:start position:0%
storage so that they will overcome the
intermittency

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
intermittency
 
01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:18.740 align:start position:0%
uh hurdle
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes so we can have projects enter
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
into the queue as a paired project so
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
it's a battery paired with the renewable
 
01:03:28.849 --> 01:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
energy and the way that in this chart
 
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
this is broken down battery storage is
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
Standalone it's just a battery
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
insulation be it whatever type of
 
01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:36.380 align:start position:0%
Technology they've chosen to use
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
included in the Solar number here would
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
be solar Plus Storage and the same for
 
01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
when if it was wind Plus Storage would
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
be the way that they're interconnecting
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
through the queue is under that General
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
category we can always I could we could
 
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
dig into the numbers and just break it
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
out to see how much
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
of that wind or of that solar was uh
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
paired with a battery resource and get
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you that would be really
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
helpful just to better understand the
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
the evolution of the grid that we're
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
seeing and I anecdotally
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago we saw more of those
 
01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
types of projects interconnecting
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
now we see much more large-scale battery
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's Standalone for that are the types
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
of projects we're seeing we have seen in
 
01:04:28.930 --> 01:04:28.940 align:start position:0%
the last few years fewer paired projects
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question um
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
I wanted to hold this but I think that
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're here now uh how many megawatt
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
hours of battery storage do we presently
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
we have one dispatchable uh battery
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
storage project which 20 megawatts
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
from a dispatchable resource from a
 
01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
generating resource I don't know I'd
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
have to look it up
 
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:05.420 align:start position:0%
okay uh follow up please follow up
 
01:05:08.089 --> 01:05:08.099 align:start position:0%
the other question is it's 20 000
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
megawatts but how many hours will it run
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
because without those numbers you it's
 
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.210 align:start position:0%
because without those numbers you it's
meaningless

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.089 --> 01:05:20.099 align:start position:0%
so I I believe that the project that
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
that project itself is a two to four
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
hour storage project but I'm not 100
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure I would have to confirm if that
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
number is correct and that is a number
 
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
that would be that's from their the the
 
01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:36.839 align:start position:0%
project specifics materials versus from
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
the isos we can see from in one of our
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
resources for our data sheets for every
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
generating resource which there are
 
01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
thousands in New England that are
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
non-dispatchable including all the
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
resources they get a capacity rating
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
which is based on so 100 megawatt Wind
 
01:05:56.270 --> 01:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
Farm does not produce 100 megawatts from
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
that you know it has a rating like it's
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
a capacity Factor rating to its
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
generation from an operational
 
01:06:04.849 --> 01:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
perspective same with solar because of
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
just intermittency and resources and
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
batteries have similar types of a
 
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
capacity rating but that is a resource
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
that is public and we could look at
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:29.579 align:start position:0%
um just quickly I'll note here uh I
 
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:31.140 align:start position:0%
pulled out the numbers so this is
 
01:06:34.849 --> 01:06:34.859 align:start position:0%
looking at total proposed generators per
 
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
state and I just wanted to highlight the
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire number it's 858 the
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
majority of that is solar and there's a
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
portion that is hydro so just for
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
okay we've
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
hinted at this a little bit in some of
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the questions but these resources are
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
going to require Transmission in order
 
01:06:59.750 --> 01:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
to deliver the electricity
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so we currently have seven elective
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
transmission upgrades or what we refer
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
to as etus these are transmission lines
 
01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
that are not being built for
 
01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:12.539 align:start position:0%
specifically for reliability these are
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
the elective transmission upgrades and
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
this is they would be able to deliver
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
about 13 000 megawatts of of clean
 
01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.529 align:start position:0%
about 13 000 megawatts of of clean
energy

01:07:20.529 --> 01:07:20.539 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
and also to note here as we saw a lot of
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
the generators in the queue are wind
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
majority of those offshore wind and
 
01:07:30.529 --> 01:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
those are also obviously going to
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
require Transmission in order to deliver
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
power so that is where we're seeing the
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
types of of transmission within the
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
queue as well
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman getting back to
 
01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
the previous slide I just want to get
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
clarified on this will you have 858
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
megawatts of and you say mostly solar so
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
that would be 850 8 megawatts whatever
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
the part of that is solar but the actual
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
output would be something around 13.5
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
percent of that I think that's the
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
factor that's used in New Hampshire for
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
solar I would have to look I don't know
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know that number off the top of
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
my head but but it's not 858 it's some
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
something quite less that's the main
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
plate capacity of the installation all
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.430 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right so we're going to talk oh
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a quick question
 
01:08:33.349 --> 01:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
before we go on thank you very much and
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
again thanks for coming of those seven
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
transmission upgrades
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um how many of them are
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
uh would go would pass through New
 
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:47.749 align:start position:0%
uh would go would pass through New
Hampshire

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know that off the top of my head
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
and just when I think about that we
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
would know their the way that those work
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
of where they terminate I wonder if it's
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
if we have the information we'll see
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
what we have available that's that's
 
01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:10.550 align:start position:0%
what we have available that's that's
public

01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:13.259 align:start position:0%
I want to touch a briefly upon before we
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
end today about the role of transmission
 
01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:17.699 align:start position:0%
in the system because we as we've noted
 
01:09:19.849 --> 01:09:19.859 align:start position:0%
the evolving system is going to require
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
significant investment in transmission
 
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
and it is something that the region has
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
already invested
 
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
significantly in in the past and a major
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
part of the iso's responsibility is
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
transmission system planning and this is
 
01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:34.249 align:start position:0%
transmission system planning and this is
uh

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
required under our RTO and ISO for
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
regulated tariff to do this type of
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
planning and we in addition to the
 
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue we conduct
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
transmission system needs assessments
 
01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
these are based on different regions of
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
the New England power system so they are
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
specific for Boston area upper Maine
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont Western Connecticut so they're
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
very they dive deeply into the specific
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
region of
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the area and look at what any types
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
of needs are for system upgrades this
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
can be Transformer upgrades this also
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
can include things like pole replacement
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
our transmission system we do a lot of
 
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of updates from our
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
utilities in the region about the
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
conditions of it polls and different
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
assets in the region so it's a very
 
01:10:32.330 --> 01:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
broad part of the iso's work and
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
one specific part of this is development
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
of a what we call our regional system
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
plan which is a 10-year planning Horizon
 
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.990 align:start position:0%
plan which is a 10-year planning Horizon
document

01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned as a region we have
 
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
invested significantly in transmission
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
since the early 2000s we have put almost
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
11 billion dollars of investment into
 
01:10:54.649 --> 01:10:54.659 align:start position:0%
the region from a reliability
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
perspective and we have about one more
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
billion planned of investment in
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
transmission through the next uh through
 
01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
the end of 2025.
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
and these are projects that are not what
 
01:11:08.810 --> 01:11:08.820 align:start position:0%
Melissa was talking about with the
 
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
electro elective transmission upgrades
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
these are projects that are invested in
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to meet reliability
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
standards that the iso is beholden to
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
and they are allocated across the states
 
01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:23.159 align:start position:0%
um based on the amount of electricity
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
demand in the area so Massachusetts pays
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
for the bulk of this these Investments
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
and you can see the breakdown across the
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
and these investments in transmission
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
for reliability but they have other
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
types of benefits that all six states in
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
the region see as a result transmission
 
01:11:47.159 --> 01:11:48.550 align:start position:0%
the region see as a result transmission
has

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
dramatically reduced and almost
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated out-of-market costs where
 
01:11:55.550 --> 01:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
um reliability agreements were needed
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
with generators to provide a weak area
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
of the grid protection until investment
 
01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
was upgraded in that region one of those
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
examples is what I said was the Mystic
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
reliability must run project which is
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
one ongoing RMR but prior in the early
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
2000s those were much more common in an
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
expensive an expense incurred by the
 
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
expensive an expense incurred by the
region

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
region
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
the markets investment in transmission
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
also allows for power to flow across the
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
region from where it is least expensive
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
so that we can maximize the economic
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
dispatch of the cheapest resources in
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
the region and that allows
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
all of the region to benefit from the
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
cheaper resources and
 
01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
as we have seen transmission upgrades
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
we have allowed older less efficient
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
resources a more expensive resources to
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
retire because we are able to move power
 
01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:55.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
this chart shows the reduction in costs
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
that the region was paying previously
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
when I mentioned about congestion and
 
01:13:07.689 --> 01:13:07.699 align:start position:0%
reliability agreements and what we call
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
ncpc which is known as uplift is a make
 
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
whole payment
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
um not to dig into these at this time
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
very deeply but you can see in the early
 
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
in the mid 2000s there were significant
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
costs associated with these types of
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
agreements and different types of
 
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
congestion that the investment in
 
01:13:28.729 --> 01:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
reliability has really eliminated for
 
01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:37.020 align:start position:0%
so looking ahead oh
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um this actually
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
ties back to my question I asked earlier
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you for answering the part
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
about the uh the moper
 
01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
um the other part of that question was
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
about Casper and increased legal fees I
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
know against the Sierra Club they're
 
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
trying to fight against Casper and also
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
the uh how much has that increased our
 
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
price rates and how much have uh also
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
state regulations from like Connecticut
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and such raise the rates
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
and how much do we live that here in New
 
01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being part of I saw New
 
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.689 align:start position:0%
Hampshire being part of I saw New
England

01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:14:13.610 --> 01:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
so the
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that the states make based on
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
policies are not part of social sale uh
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
before you go on before you answer that
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
question could you explain what Casper
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
is for those who don't know yes oh
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
that's good it's not the Friendly Ghost
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna be hard-pressed to remember
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
the acronym of what it stands for off
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:36.830 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
I

01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what that one stands
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
for so Casper was part of the market
 
01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:47.159 align:start position:0%
systems that was a goal to create a
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
substitution auction and to facilitate
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
clean energy resources making it into
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity market with the
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment that they are receiving
 
01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
subsidies in the forms of
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
um P power purchase agreements with the
 
01:15:07.070 --> 01:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
different states for renewable resources
 
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:07.850 align:start position:0%
different states for renewable resources
um

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
any sort of litigation that has to
 
01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
happen with that is that that is that is
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
not tied to the iso's billing in in any
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
sense any sort of decisions of working
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
through project
 
01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
um tariff revisions that go through the
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholder process is our normal course
 
01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:28.260 align:start position:0%
of business so I can't I I can't say
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
that there was a specific cost allocated
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
with that every tariff revision involves
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
significant economic engineering and
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholder support and that's what we
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
just that's part of our our operating
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
plan and any Connecticut's or Rhode
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
Island or Massachusetts policies are not
 
01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
part of the wholesale power system are
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
the costs that the ISO incurs on behalf
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
of the region is procuring wholesale
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
power those are power those are policy
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
decisions made by the states that are
 
01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
paid by their constituents and are not
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
part of our our costs
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
Casper stands for competitive auctions
 
01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
with sponsored policy resources
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
what that means it's a sub that's the
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
idea of a substitution auction where I'm
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
a resource and I have a capacity Supply
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
obligation but I actually want to leave
 
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:20.900 align:start position:0%
the market I will trade my resource
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
obligation to a qualified renewable
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
energy project to take it from me and
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
then I will retire
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
continue on
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
so I briefly would like to touch upon a
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
few of the studies that we're looking at
 
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
to go forward in the region
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
one of the studies that we did over the
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
last two years is called the Future
 
01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
Grade reliability study and this is a
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
multi-phase stakeholder study run
 
01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
through knee pool and requested by Nepal
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
to evaluate what the 2040 grid could
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
would look like with significantly more
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
Renewables and greater amount of
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
electrification we have hosted a public
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
webinar on this when the whole thing is
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
public for the region
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um but the the findings of this look at
 
01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:13.219 align:start position:0%
a variety of different clean energy
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
penetration scenarios and what that
 
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
means from a reliability perspective and
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
when they're we we would see
 
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
constraints or issues on the power
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
system again this is a scenario based
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
analysis this is not prescriptive of
 
01:17:29.689 --> 01:17:29.699 align:start position:0%
what would be but it is a way that the
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in New England asked ISO to
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
prevent some information to begin the
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
conversation of looking farther ahead
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
beyond the 10-year Horizon what could
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
the region be looking like and what do
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
we need to consider now to if we want to
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is a overview of all a selection of
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
some of the ongoing studies that we're
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
looking at to prepare the future for a
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
future Grid in the one of them is
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
looking at the impacts of extreme
 
01:17:58.669 --> 01:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
weather events
 
01:18:01.130 --> 01:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
another is the 2050 transmission study
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
which I had referenced earlier and I
 
01:18:04.189 --> 01:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
have some additional information on
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
about transmission needs to support a
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
high load a high renewable future
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
looking we talked about the reliable
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
future grid reliability study we looked
 
01:18:17.689 --> 01:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
at markets Pathways to the Future grid
 
01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:19.980 align:start position:0%
to evaluate different Market options to
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
support a renewable heavy grid and that
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
comes to mind afford clean energy Market
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
or a carbon price different Market neck
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that you could imagine for a
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
future to make sure there's no need for
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
a Casper or a moper to have a different
 
01:18:35.630 --> 01:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
approach to have it be a market-based
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism versus State individualized
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
procurement of clean energy
 
01:18:43.610 --> 01:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
um and then the transmission planning
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
for clean energy transition was another
 
01:18:47.649 --> 01:18:47.659 align:start position:0%
type of assessment on a shorter term
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
more immediate preparations for a future
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
of high Renewables
 
01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
I know that's just the highest level
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
those are all linked we'll provide a PDF
 
01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:00.659 align:start position:0%
and if you have specific questions all
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
of these have executive summaries and
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
high level overviews that are accessible
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
on those links and that we can always
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
oh representative Noel has a question
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not clear in my mind as to do
 
01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
you actually own the transmission
 
01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.570 align:start position:0%
you actually own the transmission
Network

01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
Network
 
01:19:28.189 --> 01:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's a great question Representative
 
01:19:30.350 --> 01:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
no the answer is no we do not the iso
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
owns no facilities or generating
 
01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
generators in the region the only things
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
that we own are our our office in
 
01:19:39.169 --> 01:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
Western Massachusetts in a backup
 
01:19:41.689 --> 01:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
control center in Connecticut the all
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
the transmission and facilities are
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
owned by the transmission operators or
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
the generators themselves our role is
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
just to study and ensure system
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
reliability so everything else is owned
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
by separate entities
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:57.350 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
just

01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
so the planning that you're discussing
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
now goes to the local util utility and
 
01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:06.540 align:start position:0%
they are expected to carry out the the
 
01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
build out so the planning that we do we
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
work we are in I so we work with our
 
01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
local control centers which are six
 
01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
control centers within the region that
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
then they work with utilities but the
 
01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing is not related to
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
a distribution system that would be the
 
01:20:27.709 --> 01:20:27.719 align:start position:0%
streets the local your the local power
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
lines on your streets or in your
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods or in in the city we're
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
working at the wholesale level so
 
01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
there's connections to those uh to those
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
utilities obviously but we they're not
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
our part of our jurisdiction because
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
they're the distribute distribution
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
companies those types they have
 
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
authority to their local Public Utility
 
01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.930 align:start position:0%
authority to their local Public Utility
Commission

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.610 align:start position:0%
Commission
um

01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
what the studies were doing is at the
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
wholesale level in a regional level that
 
01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
and these are just
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're not prescriptive they're
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
not to say this must get built right
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
here right now the way that the iso
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
works from a reliability standpoint if
 
01:21:05.870 --> 01:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
we had a reliability need that we
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
identified via a transmission we would
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
open a request for proposals and let
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
different transmission owners generators
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
battery storage any type of operate
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
anyone to submit a project to the iso
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
for public evaluation to then determine
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
based on cost Effectiveness and
 
01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:26.219 align:start position:0%
solutions what was the best for the
 
01:21:28.729 --> 01:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
region so there's a variety of different
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
levels of authority in that I I hope
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
okay continue please yeah and I as
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
Melissa makes a good point to note that
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
these these studies are at on the
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
request of our stakeholders and
 
01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
including our states through through
 
01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
Nesco and through the economic study
 
01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
process we the iso supports the region
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
in pursuing these studies that ISO does
 
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:55.500 align:start position:0%
not develop the assumptions by ourselves
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
and present these we work with our
 
01:21:59.450 --> 01:21:59.460 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and with Consultants as
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
approved through our the stakeholder
 
01:22:03.649 --> 01:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
process and all every step along the way
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
the assumptions the inputs the data are
 
01:22:08.689 --> 01:22:08.699 align:start position:0%
all reviewed through our stakeholder
 
01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:10.739 align:start position:0%
process because these studies are are
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
for the stakeholders and the different
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
participants in Nepal in the region
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
they're not for our our use and benefit
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
I'm just to be I want to be conscious of
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
time I have a couple more slides that we
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
could go through just that talk about
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
some of the takeaways of these studies
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
or if you know chair if you'd like us
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
just have questions okay so this is a
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
high level takeaway of the 2050
 
01:22:38.810 --> 01:22:38.820 align:start position:0%
transmission study
 
01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:42.060 align:start position:0%
and what this shift shows us is a
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
significant growth in the need for
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
transmission to meet increased load due
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
to electrification and
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
um in the region and we see that
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
currently the way that there would be
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
with this increased demand and load that
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
in the future scenarios that there would
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
be more instances of transmission line
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
overload from so which would be a
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
reliability violation so this type of
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
study allows us to see where in the
 
01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:14.699 align:start position:0%
system we could anticipate those types
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
of reliability issues looking ahead and
 
01:23:19.970 --> 01:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
where we would need to invest the system
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
01:23:24.770 --> 01:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
so it's the first step in a conversation
 
01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
about what does the future grid look
 
01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
like it allows us from an engineering
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
perspective and a reliability
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
perspective to say here are where
 
01:23:33.649 --> 01:23:33.659 align:start position:0%
potential issues would be and begin the
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
so then the next steps of the studies
 
01:23:36.060 --> 01:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
so then the next steps of the studies
are

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
what are potential solutions to those uh
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
we also see that we switch to a winter
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
peaking system as I mentioned we
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
anticipate this that by
 
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
anticipate this that by
um

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
2040 that we are winter peaking system
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
and that by 2050 we see
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
a winter peak of 57 000 gigawatts which
 
01:24:03.050 --> 01:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
is significantly more as I mentioned our
 
01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:04.800 align:start position:0%
current Peaks are in the that we've seen
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the region are in the upper 28 000
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts in the early 2000s so this
 
01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
would this is a significant change and
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
an important realization for us to start
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
and you can see here that there's a
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the types of load electric
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
heating electrification transportation
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
and air conditioning where the summer
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
has an air conditioning Peak and you can
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
see that the heating electrification is
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
the winter the Green Peak which is a
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
when we step back we're doing all this
 
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
work at all these different studies and
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
different parts of our responsibilities
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
at the iso way we see if in our role
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
that there are four pillars to support
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
the state's clean energy transition and
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
that is significant amounts of clean
 
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.490 align:start position:0%
that is significant amounts of clean
energy

01:25:01.490 --> 01:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
the need for balancing resources
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
so those are resources that can respond
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
quickly and offer different types of
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
ancillary service characteristics to
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
provide reliability
 
01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
energy adequacy so making sure that our
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
generators have the fuel and energy they
 
01:25:23.209 --> 01:25:23.219 align:start position:0%
need to run to be available and that we
 
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
need robust Transmission in the region
 
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
to facilitate this integration of clean
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
energy as driven by the state's the
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
majority of the state's policies in New
 
01:25:32.699 --> 01:25:34.669 align:start position:0%
majority of the state's policies in New
England

01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
England
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
and then the next couple slides are just
 
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
um links to different resources that we
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
have in New England and at the ISO on
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
about New England and then these are
 
01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
more accessible via your electronic
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
handout for additional information about
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
our most recent strategic plan and
 
01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
we would like to note that we do hold
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
what we are known as the CLG the
 
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
consumer liaison group it's a public
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
meeting quarterly for anyone in New
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
England to join and hear directly from
 
01:26:12.530 --> 01:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
the iso about ongoing projects and
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
status updates
 
01:26:14.639 --> 01:26:15.709 align:start position:0%
status updates
um

01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire consumer Advocate has
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
been greatly Don cries has been is very
 
01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
involved in this season on the CLG uh
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
Coordinating Committee and it's just
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
another resource that we have and we
 
01:26:28.490 --> 01:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
move sometimes there they have been
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
virtual in the past but we rotate around
 
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
the different parts of New England to
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
make them accessible for people in
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
different areas of the state and
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
everyone is welcome to be part of that
 
01:26:38.159 --> 01:26:39.470 align:start position:0%
everyone is welcome to be part of that
and

01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
if you're interested we have a an app
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
that allows you to see the prices and
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
any system issues in real time to
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
receive notifications I'm happy to help
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
if anyone is interested in that and get
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
it on your phone and as always we'd like
 
01:26:57.410 --> 01:26:57.420 align:start position:0%
to extend the the invitation for the
 
01:26:58.970 --> 01:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
committee members to come down to the
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
iso and have a control room tour
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
sometime we would love to have you and
 
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:05.340 align:start position:0%
have you meet our operators and walk
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
through the day-to-day operations in
 
01:27:10.669 --> 01:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
real life and to see the men and women
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
that are you know keeping the power
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
running all year long for us
 
01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
great presentation
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
and congratulations to you both for
 
01:27:22.490 --> 01:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
getting it in before noon time we
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate that however we're probably
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to keep you here for a while with
 
01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
questions because I know there are quite
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
a few so I'll call First on
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I guess one of
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
the big issues is going to be the
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
transmission obviously you spoke quite a
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
bit about that earlier you talked about
 
01:27:45.229 --> 01:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
seven etus uh and then you talk about
 
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
building transmission for reliability
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
now I think we understand the
 
01:27:51.649 --> 01:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
reliability the transmission is tacked
 
01:27:53.209 --> 01:27:53.219 align:start position:0%
on to each state according to its
 
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
percentage of load it's a graph you
 
01:27:57.169 --> 01:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
showed the etus don't fit into that
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
category though so how is it going to be
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
decided who pays for the etus is that
 
01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:05.820 align:start position:0%
going to be the the generator or are we
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to see States like Massachusetts
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
coming out and saying well no we need
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
the the uh Renewable Power therefore
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
everybody should pay for this not just
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
the people from Massachusetts or however
 
01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
the generator how is who's going to pay
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
for the etus well Massachusetts does not
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
have the authority to tell the rest of
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
New England that they should pay for
 
01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
that for a generator Massachusetts but
 
01:28:33.729 --> 01:28:33.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
they can as they had enter into a power
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement with as part of a
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
clean energy solicitation and they chose
 
01:28:43.610 --> 01:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
the New England clean energy connect
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
through Maine and the Massachusetts
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
residents would be would pay for that
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
through their bills
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
um in that type any of the etus would be
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
paid for through the develop the
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
developer of the project and they are
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
looking to interconnect through
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
state public policy solicitations they
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
are looking for one of the states to buy
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
the power that they are offering to
 
01:29:08.410 --> 01:29:08.420 align:start position:0%
bring in thank you
 
01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I actually have
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:29:16.129 --> 01:29:16.139 align:start position:0%
um the first is
 
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
um back earlier in the presentation
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
there was a slide that's on page seven
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the handout that shows the
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
distribution of
 
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.649 align:start position:0%
distribution of
um

01:29:24.649 --> 01:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
electricity sources
 
01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.410 align:start position:0%
electricity sources
um

01:29:27.410 --> 01:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:29.990 --> 01:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
gas nuclear Etc
 
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:30.649 align:start position:0%
gas nuclear Etc
um

01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:32.629 --> 01:29:32.639 align:start position:0%
too many years ago I worked for a
 
01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
company that developed and operated uh
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
questions refuse burning power plants
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
um and we had two about 200 megawatts of
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
capacity in New England is that
 
01:29:46.250 --> 01:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
considered part of Renewables I guess my
 
01:29:48.229 --> 01:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
first question is are they part of the
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
pro uh the of iso and secondly is that
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
yeah the way thank you for the question
 
01:30:00.350 --> 01:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
we do have some of those facilities in
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
New England and they are categorized
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
under this as a renewable as Renewables
 
01:30:08.689 --> 01:30:08.699 align:start position:0%
which is based on which is not
 
01:30:10.370 --> 01:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
consistent against all across all states
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
but this is how in this they are grouped
 
01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%
thank you and my follow-up question is
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
um do you does ISO have any involvement
 
01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
at all in the management of renewable
 
01:30:26.090 --> 01:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
energy credits
 
01:30:27.950 --> 01:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
no we do not okay thank you
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh turning to your
 
01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:35.940 align:start position:0%
four pillars necessary to support
 
01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
successful uh clean energy transition
 
01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
number three is clean is energy adequacy
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
is there a number of megawatts that
 
01:30:48.530 --> 01:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
you're looking up dispatchable power
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for there
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we every year Melissa is going to
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
help me we do an assessment for the the
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
next year about the amount of load that
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
will be needed ahead of time and this is
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
part of the forward capacity market so
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
we do the three year when we do the four
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
capacity Market we look three years out
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
how much capacity we anticipate that we
 
01:31:11.689 --> 01:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
will need to be there so when we think
 
01:31:15.050 --> 01:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
about energy adequacy we are thinking
 
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:16.980 align:start position:0%
about it from
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
not only that that like sort of
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
three-year time frame using the forward
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
capacity Market to secure obligations
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
but also from a day-to-day perspective
 
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
so energy adequacy is not a megawatt
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily that we're looking at at
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
this point this is more of an idea of
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
when we we've started a process at the
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
iso when we to look at for example
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
natural gas facilities
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
how should they be rated from a resource
 
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
adequacy perspective if their fuel is
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
not firm and fixed should we re-evaluate
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
the capacity Factor like we do for wind
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
and solar for a natural gas facility if
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
they don't have a firm contract so it's
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
those types of conversations to say that
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
in the past perhaps this this new this
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
natural gas facility had a thousand
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
megawatt just we're just making it up a
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
capacity in the future should they only
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
have a with a with a capacity Factor
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
added in should they really be 650
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
megawatt project uh facility because of
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
their ability to procure gas in the
 
01:32:21.890 --> 01:32:21.900 align:start position:0%
system so it's a reevaluation of some of
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
the assumptions that we've had in the
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
past about the types of resources that
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
are available so that we are better
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
capturing the real energy availability
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
and fuel that that they have to provide
 
01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:35.060 align:start position:0%
to the region so we're reevaluating
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
parts of what we how we have assessed
 
01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
things in the past to be better to
 
01:32:42.649 --> 01:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
better reflect the actual energy
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
adequacy the energy that they that they
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
have so that we're prepared in a region
 
01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.250 align:start position:0%
have so that we're prepared in a region
correctly

01:32:49.250 --> 01:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:32:53.770 --> 01:32:53.780 align:start position:0%
so okay so I understand
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh assessment of that but
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
in in the planning for 2050 you have to
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
at least have some kind of idea of what
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh firm dispatchable power you will need
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
and so is there any numbers on that yeah
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
so in on from the 2050 transmission
 
01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
study we anticipate the winter Peak to
 
01:33:22.669 --> 01:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
be 57 gigawatts of peak so
 
01:33:22.679 --> 01:33:24.110 align:start position:0%
be 57 gigawatts of peak so
if

01:33:24.110 --> 01:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
nothing changed at all that's where we
 
01:33:29.149 --> 01:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
would be but this study again is it's
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
pers it
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's not it's it's just a study it's
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
just an analysis of one potential future
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
so the it begins a conversation of what
 
01:33:40.850 --> 01:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
is the composition of of that 57
 
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:42.060 align:start position:0%
gigawatts and what are the
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
characteristics of it and this is when
 
01:33:46.930 --> 01:33:46.940 align:start position:0%
we begin to talk about the different
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
ancillary service and types of
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
characteristics that we are looking for
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
in types of in a generating resource and
 
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
that perhaps they need to change we
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
currently what we have nine ancillary
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
Services seven ancillary services that
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
we use a market for Ireland has over 20
 
01:34:04.729 --> 01:34:04.739 align:start position:0%
ancillary services in their energy
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
system that they are valuing and giving
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
money to to make sure that they will be
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
there so the idea of Baseline power is
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
we think is going to change it's going
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
to be more of a characteristic of
 
01:34:18.110 --> 01:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
response time so what are the types of
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
responses that we have within this 57
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
gigawatt so when we're thinking about
 
01:34:23.689 --> 01:34:23.699 align:start position:0%
energy adequacy it's what are the
 
01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:25.340 align:start position:0%
characteristics that the different
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
generators are offering to this change
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
system that we need we need things that
 
01:34:32.209 --> 01:34:32.219 align:start position:0%
ramp up quickly we need things that are
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
responsive and that those are the sort
 
01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:36.900 align:start position:0%
of conversations that we're having and
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
the study goes into more detail about
 
01:34:40.729 --> 01:34:40.739 align:start position:0%
this some of these studies that
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
like trade having some trade-offs if you
 
01:34:46.189 --> 01:34:46.199 align:start position:0%
did all Renewables you may need x amount
 
01:34:48.290 --> 01:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
of generation installed to you know to
 
01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
meet the capacity factors that those see
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
but if you had
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
a thousand Mega an extra thousand
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
megawatts of dispatchable generation it
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
brings down the need for potential
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
renewable investment way down because
 
01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:02.340 align:start position:0%
you have a little bit of a buffer in
 
01:35:04.850 --> 01:35:04.860 align:start position:0%
room so some of the studies get into the
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
types of resources and the different
 
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
the kind of the trade-offs that you
 
01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
could have within the scenarios which
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
might be of interest that we can that we
 
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:16.860 align:start position:0%
can share but it's not going to be this
 
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
is not the answer of what we need
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily for 2050 it's the first
 
01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
study in the process to begin to
 
01:35:24.129 --> 01:35:24.139 align:start position:0%
understand that system thank you
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so referring to
 
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
the slide that is up there right now uh
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing that for the winter Peak
 
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of that is coming from Heating
 
01:35:40.129 --> 01:35:40.139 align:start position:0%
electrification and from transportation
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
and two questions related to that so am
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
I correct in understanding that the
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
heating electrification is primarily
 
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
heat pumps
 
01:35:51.530 --> 01:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
yes this is this is studying heat pumps
 
01:35:55.490 --> 01:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
replacing gas and oil burners okay and
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
then for the transportation is that
 
01:35:59.149 --> 01:35:59.159 align:start position:0%
taking into account that there's often a
 
01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
flexibility about when you're actually
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
going to be charging and that you can do
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
the level of this study we we talk about
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
some of the assumptions about that of
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
ability and the different scenarios I
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
believe have different
 
01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
some of them look at some of that but
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
the detail of that
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh two-way charging Demand on the grid
 
01:36:26.689 --> 01:36:26.699 align:start position:0%
at this study is not the it's not part
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
of the actual
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's not as much of a factor it has to
 
01:36:33.709 --> 01:36:33.719 align:start position:0%
be assumed to be a pretty low level at
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
this point because we don't have any
 
01:36:37.729 --> 01:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
policies or procedures in place for us
 
01:36:37.739 --> 01:36:40.310 align:start position:0%
policies or procedures in place for us
to

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
to use as examples yet we anticipate
 
01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
them coming and this is going to be part
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the conversation but again at this
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
point this is a higher level assumption
 
01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:49.739 align:start position:0%
about the inputs so it doesn't quite
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
satisfy your question but it is
 
01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:54.179 align:start position:0%
something that we are aware of
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and looking we will reap a part of
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
the conversation moving forward
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
this question goes to the um
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
I guess granularity of the visibility of
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
iso iso's visibility in the forecasts
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
information that you you're reporting
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
to us
 
01:37:27.050 --> 01:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
um for what I mean by that again
 
01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:29.820 align:start position:0%
referring back to the slide that was
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
page 12 where you say what's in the
 
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
and for there's it's in yellow so really
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
hard to read but apparently about four
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
thousand almost four thousand megawatts
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
of solar are in the interconnection
 
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:50.629 align:start position:0%
of solar are in the interconnection
queue

01:37:50.629 --> 01:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
um and sort of relating that to the much
 
01:37:58.850 --> 01:37:58.860 align:start position:0%
later slides with expected demand Etc
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
does the 4 000 megawatts in the
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue how how low does
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
that go in other words does that include
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
the expected installations by businesses
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
and homes of Distributing the wholesale
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
power system so where we have
 
01:38:14.330 --> 01:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction as the iso that would not
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
include solar looking to interconnect to
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
your local Distribution Company or so
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
something like on someone's rooftop
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
those are solar insertions that we have
 
01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:26.820 align:start position:0%
no visibility in the iso does not have
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
visibility to the local distribution
 
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.570 align:start position:0%
visibility to the local distribution
companies

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
system in that way we partner with them
 
01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
to understand where that solar is being
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
installed because we don't see it as a
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
generation resource we see it as a
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
reduction in demand so we work every
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
year we update a 10-year forecast for
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
the P solar PV that includes behind the
 
01:38:48.590 --> 01:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
meter solar and we work closely with the
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
New England states and the utilities to
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
best capture the data that they have so
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
that we can use that in our forecasting
 
01:38:58.189 --> 01:38:58.199 align:start position:0%
but it's a big part of what our
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
forecasting team does not only in the
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
long-term forecast but for the day ahead
 
01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
in the real time forecast because that
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
the the level of behind the meter solar
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
penetration and the way that the cloud
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
cover moves across New England is a big
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
part of our daily forecast
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
follow up okay yes so again stuff
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
following up on that
 
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
on that answer you're saying that
 
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.270 align:start position:0%
on that answer you're saying that
significant

01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:39:25.550 --> 01:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
behind the meter solar generation
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
something like the megawatt at North
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
Conway water Precinct or the megawatt on
 
01:39:32.890 --> 01:39:32.900 align:start position:0%
the roof across it America
 
01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
Associated Grocers of New England or 600
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
kilowatts on Oyster River Middle School
 
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
those are not
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
visible to you at the iso in this
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
forecasting way they seem to be visible
 
01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
in in hindsight in the craft that you
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
showed EE and solar has reduced demand
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
so if those any of those entities were
 
01:39:54.590 --> 01:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
have that have sold are participating in
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
the wholesale energy markets
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
then we do see them so if they have
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
decided to be part of a RFP or that
 
01:40:04.910 --> 01:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
they're looking to get money from the
 
01:40:08.030 --> 01:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
host at which you you could then they or
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
through an aggregation there's different
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
ways that they could participate and if
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
they did then we would have more insight
 
01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're not dispatchable in that way
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
but like so if I put solar on my house
 
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:20.340 align:start position:0%
the iso would never see it nor know it
 
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
but my local utility would have that
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
information and then they would
 
01:40:26.209 --> 01:40:26.219 align:start position:0%
aggregate that information at the county
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
level and roll that up and provide that
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
information to the iso and I would like
 
01:40:32.570 --> 01:40:32.580 align:start position:0%
to note that the isoq is all public
 
01:40:34.490 --> 01:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
information anybody here could download
 
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't have project names it has
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
Q identifier numbers so there is some
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
limit to what is public and from the
 
01:40:45.169 --> 01:40:45.179 align:start position:0%
emission but from the iso's perspective
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
all projects looking to interconnect
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
into our system is made public and
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
updated regularly
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Doug Thomas has one
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
final question
 
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
it could be a doozy too uh just there
 
01:41:01.910 --> 01:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
has been a lot of talk
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
around so my question is what would be
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
the implication the obstacles for any
 
01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:13.860 align:start position:0%
state that wanted to detach itself from
 
01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
the grid and not be a part of say any
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
ISO organization
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure so first the states of New England
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
themselves are not part of the iso it's
 
01:41:28.129 --> 01:41:28.139 align:start position:0%
the transmission operators within the
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
states that are have entered into an
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with the iso as approved by
 
01:41:34.609 --> 01:41:34.619 align:start position:0%
ferc so
 
01:41:37.010 --> 01:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
we have seen States in New England think
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
about the leaving the iso and retaking
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
resource adequacy and retaking a lot of
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
the work that we do at a regional basis
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
back to to have ownership
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
for their own State
 
01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
um Maine has looked at this Connecticut
 
01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
has looked at this and both of them in
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
their assessments came to the conclusion
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
that the benefits that the states
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
receive from Regional investments in
 
01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
transmission and the economic dispatch
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
across state lines have more benefits
 
01:42:05.159 --> 01:42:07.490 align:start position:0%
across state lines have more benefits
than

01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
it leaving makes sense that being said
 
01:42:12.950 --> 01:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
there is no re there is just no
 
01:42:15.890 --> 01:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
blueprint in New England or any state
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of anywhere in the region
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
in the country that has left an ISO
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
there's no blueprint for what that would
 
01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:22.010 align:start position:0%
there's no blueprint for what that would
be

01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
so in theory and the estate would need
 
01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
to coordinate with their transmission
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
operators to propose to ferc that they
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
were leaving and then would need to be
 
01:42:35.090 --> 01:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
able to demonstrate that they would
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
still be able to meet the reliability
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
requirements of their interconnected
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
Regional grid
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
that the iso is currently mating on
 
01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
those behalfs so
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
it's just a big unknown we don't know
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
what that would look like or the
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
necessarily process is because it's
 
01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.229 --> 01:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
well we would like to thank both of you
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
for making the long Trek up here and
 
01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
doing since an excellent presentation
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
and answering our questions uh
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
authoritatively we really appreciate you
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
being here you did a great job
 
01:43:10.189 --> 01:43:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I will be sure to let Eric Johnson
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
and we have a long list of follow-ups
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
that we will make sure that we get back
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
to you about and again if there are
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
additional questions Melissa and I are
 
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
happy and with Eric to help answer
 
01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:24.360 align:start position:0%
questions at any time and we would like
 
01:43:26.510 --> 01:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
to again thank you for inviting us chair
 
01:43:28.570 --> 01:43:28.580 align:start position:0%
and having us with the committee and
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
reassert that we'd love to have you come
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
down to visit the control room in ISO
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
well thank you and uh
 
01:43:39.290 --> 01:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
before we break for lunch I want to
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
alert the committee to the fact that as
 
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
I mentioned at the very beginning of
 
01:43:46.129 --> 01:43:46.139 align:start position:0%
this meeting our digital calendar has
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
been messed up for some time now
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
and it's possible that the New England
 
01:43:53.870 --> 01:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
power generators
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
saw that our meeting today was canceled
 
01:44:00.950 --> 01:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and may not show up I've sent email to
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
my contact
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh Molly is here yeah I saw her she's
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
here she might just stepped out of the
 
01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
room so great okay good good to know
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so we will return
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
here then at one o'clock for a
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
presentation by the New England power
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
generators generators Association till
 
02:38:08.510 --> 02:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
okay everyone this is your one minute
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
warning we'll start this meeting again
 
02:39:23.170 --> 02:39:23.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.450 --> 02:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay let's resume our meeting this
 
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
afternoon and
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
the final section of our meeting today
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
will be a presentation by the New
 
02:39:36.230 --> 02:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
England power Jenners generators
 
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
Association so I'd like to invite Molly
 
02:39:42.770 --> 02:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
Connors and Dan Dolan to the presenters
 
02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:44.510 align:start position:0%
Connors and Dan Dolan to the presenters
table

02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:48.180 align:start position:0%
now you have passed out some slides did
 
02:39:51.950 --> 02:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
you want to project them on the screen
 
02:39:54.349 --> 02:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh no Mr chairman they're really just
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
here for the uh for background we're not
 
02:39:58.130 --> 02:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
planning to walk through them in any
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
great detail although we're certainly
 
02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
happy to to get into any of the
 
02:40:02.750 --> 02:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
information there if if folks have
 
02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
questions for them okay thank you
 
02:40:06.770 --> 02:40:06.780 align:start position:0%
Christy you may want to turn those off
 
02:40:09.469 --> 02:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
for us thank you
 
02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay so uh take it away tell us who you
 
02:40:15.650 --> 02:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
are and why you're here what you're
 
02:40:17.270 --> 02:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to present great thank you Mr
 
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
chairman and and it's good to see
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
everybody here uh my name is Dan Dole
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm the president of the New England
 
02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
power generators Association I'm here
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
with my colleague Molly Connors we
 
02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
represent uh the companies that own the
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
vast majority of power plants both here
 
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well as across the
 
02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
Six States of New England within that
 
02:40:38.210 --> 02:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
membership is uh virtually every
 
02:40:40.490 --> 02:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
different Fuel and Technology type that
 
02:40:43.750 --> 02:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
produces electricity today in the region
 
02:40:46.849 --> 02:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
across that board will keep such a a
 
02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
wide diverse set of companies all
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
together is a belief in an open
 
02:40:53.450 --> 02:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
competitive wholesale electricity
 
02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
Marketplace in which they're all able to
 
02:40:58.910 --> 02:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
compete on an equal and Level Playing
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
Field as long as they're following the
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
market rules set out by organizations
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
like ISO New England as well as the
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
estate policies and procedures that that
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
are established for the the sighting and
 
02:41:14.389 --> 02:41:14.399 align:start position:0%
operation of of power generation
 
02:41:17.590 --> 02:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
facilities within their their territory
 
02:41:20.929 --> 02:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
as we engage in some of these
 
02:41:23.150 --> 02:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
discussions where you most often hear us
 
02:41:26.450 --> 02:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
is in discussions around what does it
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
take to sustain a competitive
 
02:41:31.550 --> 02:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
Marketplace how do we ensure that that
 
02:41:33.230 --> 02:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
we've got an equal and Level Playing
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
Field and how do we meet the The three
 
02:41:39.530 --> 02:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
principal goals that these markets have
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
of reliability affordability and an
 
02:41:45.530 --> 02:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
increasingly clean electric generation
 
02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
Fleet to serve consumers getting that
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
three-part balance right is the hard
 
02:41:55.670 --> 02:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
part and it is uh there is no single
 
02:41:57.490 --> 02:41:57.500 align:start position:0%
resource that
 
02:42:00.050 --> 02:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
immediately serves all of those needs
 
02:42:02.570 --> 02:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
and it is where we then see the
 
02:42:04.670 --> 02:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
diversity of the fuels and Technologies
 
02:42:08.210 --> 02:42:08.220 align:start position:0%
come into play now to to take a little
 
02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
bit of a a step back uh the the industry
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
and the group that we now represent
 
02:42:19.130 --> 02:42:19.140 align:start position:0%
um was accelerated and enhanced
 
02:42:21.290 --> 02:42:21.300 align:start position:0%
um by New Hampshire really becoming the
 
02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
first state in the country to
 
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
restructure its electricity industry uh
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
nearly 25 years ago and what that means
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
is moving the power plants out of
 
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
utility rate based ownership in which
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
all the the costs for development and
 
02:42:36.889 --> 02:42:36.899 align:start position:0%
operation of those facilities are
 
02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.479 align:start position:0%
recovered directly through rates and
 
02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
instead going into third-party companies
 
02:42:43.610 --> 02:42:43.620 align:start position:0%
who have to now compete against each
 
02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:46.979 align:start position:0%
other every day in the energy markets to
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can provide the most
 
02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
efficient product for for consumers
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
overall within that you then see winners
 
02:42:56.510 --> 02:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
and losers across the marketplace we see
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
plants go out of business fairly
 
02:43:00.889 --> 02:43:00.899 align:start position:0%
regularly we also see new developments
 
02:43:03.429 --> 02:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
come in and different types of companies
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
taking over and different fuel mixes is
 
02:43:08.330 --> 02:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
then of all services that can be
 
02:43:10.610 --> 02:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
delivered on the most cost effective
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
basis possible
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
from that clearly electricity is a
 
02:43:17.210 --> 02:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
volatile commodity I know you all hear
 
02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
that from your constituents particularly
 
02:43:22.010 --> 02:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
these days probably more than over the
 
02:43:24.950 --> 02:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
last several years but also in in some
 
02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
of the the charts that we do have in the
 
02:43:29.050 --> 02:43:29.060 align:start position:0%
presentation you see year to year
 
02:43:32.210 --> 02:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in wholesale electricity
 
02:43:34.849 --> 02:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
prices and yet what I think is also
 
02:43:37.130 --> 02:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
clear is that over the last 25 years
 
02:43:39.830 --> 02:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
since restructuring and since the iso
 
02:43:41.570 --> 02:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
New England markets that we operate
 
02:43:44.270 --> 02:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
under really took hold in the early
 
02:43:47.389 --> 02:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
2000s we see a clear and consistent
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
trend line of increases in efficiency in
 
02:43:52.429 --> 02:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
the operations of the facility leading
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
to lower costs and ultimately then that
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency also having major
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits both in the form
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
of emissions from Individual facilities
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the fact that today
 
02:44:08.270 --> 02:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
it takes three plants to produce the
 
02:44:10.370 --> 02:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
same number of electricity that 25 years
 
02:44:13.190 --> 02:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
ago used to take four where we're seeing
 
02:44:16.130 --> 02:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
those efficiencies really take hold and
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
so my argument is that over that long
 
02:44:21.770 --> 02:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
term taking the the step back we see
 
02:44:23.690 --> 02:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
enormous value from the competitive
 
02:44:27.650 --> 02:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
Marketplace overall the the last item
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
I'd I'd note is that clearly today we
 
02:44:33.050 --> 02:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
are seeing a refocusing not just in New
 
02:44:34.490 --> 02:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but really across New England
 
02:44:37.190 --> 02:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
around these issues of affordability and
 
02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
reliability and I I think that provides
 
02:44:44.210 --> 02:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for groups like this to
 
02:44:46.670 --> 02:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
help provide policy Direction and
 
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
Leadership to the companies that we
 
02:44:51.889 --> 02:44:51.899 align:start position:0%
represent to ISO New England and the
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
other players that that engage in the
 
02:44:56.210 --> 02:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
electricity Market overall we have a
 
02:44:58.309 --> 02:44:58.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility to make sure that we are
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
meeting the obligations set out and the
 
02:45:05.450 --> 02:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
reliability criteria as set forth by the
 
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
government as well as then how the
 
02:45:09.650 --> 02:45:09.660 align:start position:0%
markets get administered by ISO New
 
02:45:11.690 --> 02:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
England the markets are not perfect they
 
02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
are evolved loving they need to be
 
02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
improved and our hope is now we can take
 
02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
this as that opportunity to refocus and
 
02:45:22.849 --> 02:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
highlight those important areas with
 
02:45:25.370 --> 02:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
that uh certainly happy to get into any
 
02:45:27.770 --> 02:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
of the specifics that are embedded in
 
02:45:29.630 --> 02:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
the presentation here we hope to be in
 
02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
front of of you all many more times
 
02:45:33.770 --> 02:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
throughout this session and certainly
 
02:45:36.230 --> 02:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
happy here to to answer any questions we
 
02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:37.550 align:start position:0%
happy here to to answer any questions we
can

02:45:37.550 --> 02:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:45:39.530 --> 02:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
uh one quick question could you help us
 
02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:42.899 align:start position:0%
put us in context this morning ISO New
 
02:45:45.170 --> 02:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
England told us that there were 350
 
02:45:48.370 --> 02:45:48.380 align:start position:0%
generators in their Marketplace how many
 
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
of those generators are members of N E
 
02:45:52.080 --> 02:45:53.230 align:start position:0%
of those generators are members of N E
PGA

02:45:53.230 --> 02:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
PGA
 
02:45:56.150 --> 02:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we look at it less in terms of an
 
02:45:58.670 --> 02:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
absolute total of uh number of
 
02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
facilities and More in terms of the
 
02:46:02.809 --> 02:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
share of the actual generating capacity
 
02:46:07.389 --> 02:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
because what you see is so uh there are
 
02:46:10.490 --> 02:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
dozens if not hundreds of very very
 
02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
small facilities which we may not
 
02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
represent what we do represent are the
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
vast majority of what are called the
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
utility scale or larger scale facilities
 
02:46:24.469 --> 02:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
think hundreds of megawatts in in
 
02:46:26.450 --> 02:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
generation capacity
 
02:46:28.550 --> 02:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
then what you also see is certain
 
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
companies have aggregated a number of
 
02:46:33.170 --> 02:46:33.180 align:start position:0%
much smaller scale resources whether
 
02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's Hydro facilities particularly on
 
02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
the the Connecticut River here as well
 
02:46:41.510 --> 02:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
as some of the newer renewable
 
02:46:43.790 --> 02:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
facilities solar and and wind facilities
 
02:46:45.710 --> 02:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
that tend to be smaller scale in nature
 
02:46:48.110 --> 02:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
then get aggregated into a larger scale
 
02:46:50.929 --> 02:46:50.939 align:start position:0%
portfolio and with that we represent
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
approximately 90 percent of the electric
 
02:46:58.090 --> 02:46:58.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you all right let's uh open this
 
02:47:03.170 --> 02:47:03.180 align:start position:0%
up to questions from the rest of the
 
02:47:05.090 --> 02:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
committee representative Doug Thomas has
 
02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
a question
 
02:47:08.570 --> 02:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:47:11.090 --> 02:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh yes you opened
 
02:47:12.830 --> 02:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
up a lot of possible questions with your
 
02:47:14.450 --> 02:47:14.460 align:start position:0%
opening comments
 
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
um I'll go to one question or one
 
02:47:19.010 --> 02:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
comment that you made previously about
 
02:47:22.210 --> 02:47:22.220 align:start position:0%
keeping the cost down so my question is
 
02:47:25.250 --> 02:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
what is your Association and what are
 
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
the power generators doing now to try
 
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
and keep down the cost of the really
 
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
rocketing price of electricity which I'm
 
02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
sure if our consumers heard your opening
 
02:47:37.730 --> 02:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
statement they would not agree that the
 
02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
prices are have been coming down so what
 
02:47:42.170 --> 02:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
are they doing and what can they do in
 
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know in that respect yeah and and to
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
be clear we certainly recognize that
 
02:47:47.990 --> 02:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
over the last year the prices have gone
 
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
up there's no disputing that and and we
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
see that largely because uh we have seen
 
02:47:55.849 --> 02:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
the the fuels and the inputs for
 
02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
producing the actual electricity have
 
02:48:01.190 --> 02:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
also skyrocketed largely driven by the
 
02:48:03.530 --> 02:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
geopolitical forces that that we all see
 
02:48:06.290 --> 02:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
across the Atlantic in terms of what are
 
02:48:08.630 --> 02:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
the actions being taken now we are
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
seeing facilities trying to engage in
 
02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
more hedged fuel procurements
 
02:48:17.270 --> 02:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
particularly really for natural gas and
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
oil to create more stability on that
 
02:48:22.490 --> 02:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
side of the market we're also in active
 
02:48:25.190 --> 02:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
engagements with each individual State
 
02:48:28.670 --> 02:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
about how the default energy rates are
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
are procured right now New Hampshire
 
02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
like many of the other New England
 
02:48:36.610 --> 02:48:36.620 align:start position:0%
states buys the bulk of its electricity
 
02:48:40.250 --> 02:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
in over one fairly narrow discrete
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
period of time over about a six-month
 
02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
Horizon and then locks that in for
 
02:48:47.570 --> 02:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
another six months that creates then a
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
lot of volatility when we go from one
 
02:48:52.010 --> 02:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
procurement cycle to another there are
 
02:48:54.190 --> 02:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
other ways to try and smooth that out
 
02:48:57.770 --> 02:48:57.780 align:start position:0%
you can purchase portions of your
 
02:49:00.469 --> 02:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
electricity in any let's call it three
 
02:49:03.410 --> 02:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
six or nine month chunk and then ladder
 
02:49:05.809 --> 02:49:05.819 align:start position:0%
that in to smooth out the ups and downs
 
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
the challenge with that is given the
 
02:49:09.849 --> 02:49:09.859 align:start position:0%
high cost and the inflationary
 
02:49:12.110 --> 02:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
experience that we've had over the last
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
years that also means that when prices
 
02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
do fall they fall slower because you're
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
smoothing out not just the UPS but the
 
02:49:24.349 --> 02:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
Downs which is largely what gave rise to
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
the policy to do the procurements as as
 
02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're structured today overall we're
 
02:49:31.370 --> 02:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
also seeing a reinvestment occurring in
 
02:49:33.110 --> 02:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
the facilities to be able to operate
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
particularly during the winter months
 
02:49:37.130 --> 02:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
and during heightened periods of
 
02:49:40.849 --> 02:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
reliability need and the hope is that as
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
we see more facilities being able to
 
02:49:44.929 --> 02:49:44.939 align:start position:0%
provide those Services during the peak
 
02:49:47.630 --> 02:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
periods overall that creates more
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
competition and lower prices to make
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
that meet that Peak demand
 
02:49:55.130 --> 02:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow up thank you for the
 
02:49:57.530 --> 02:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh you mentioned the word
 
02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
policy a couple of times are to be clear
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
are are you referring that there might
 
02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:05.220 align:start position:0%
be some State policies that could be
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
enacted to to help that situation or or
 
02:50:11.389 --> 02:50:11.399 align:start position:0%
did I misunderstand you on that uh no
 
02:50:13.490 --> 02:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
not at all uh right now we're not
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
calling for any state legislation on
 
02:50:18.290 --> 02:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
that right now the the puc along with
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
their counterparts in other states are
 
02:50:21.410 --> 02:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
investigating what are the procurement
 
02:50:23.809 --> 02:50:23.819 align:start position:0%
practices to the degree coming out of
 
02:50:26.809 --> 02:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
that there is a requirement to provide
 
02:50:29.809 --> 02:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
more direction or
 
02:50:32.150 --> 02:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
more flexibility coming out of state
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
laws at that point we would be back in
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
front of you but today we are not asking
 
02:50:39.889 --> 02:50:39.899 align:start position:0%
for any uh meaningful change in state
 
02:50:39.899 --> 02:50:42.250 align:start position:0%
for any uh meaningful change in state
legislation

02:50:42.250 --> 02:50:42.260 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative munz is recognized for a
 
02:50:46.910 --> 02:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:50:48.650 --> 02:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
very much for coming in
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
um could you comment on the uh the 800
 
02:50:54.230 --> 02:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
percent increase in transmission rates
 
02:50:58.429 --> 02:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
since 2004 what's driving that sure uh
 
02:51:01.130 --> 02:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
and so um and for those following along
 
02:51:05.809 --> 02:51:05.819 align:start position:0%
here uh uh that is on Slide Five and
 
02:51:08.510 --> 02:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
um what we've seen is the utilities post
 
02:51:09.889 --> 02:51:09.899 align:start position:0%
restructuring have gotten out of the
 
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
business of owning and operating
 
02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
facilities they now own and operate the
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution networks
 
02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
those are effectively the roads and the
 
02:51:20.510 --> 02:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
bridges on which we deliver our our
 
02:51:23.210 --> 02:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
product a lot of that is aging and
 
02:51:26.389 --> 02:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
rightfully needs to be replaced it also
 
02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
was coming out of a system in which the
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the transmission
 
02:51:33.770 --> 02:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
network was was very localized the the
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
term of art we use in the electricity
 
02:51:39.590 --> 02:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
industry was a hub and spoke system and
 
02:51:42.950 --> 02:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
from that there was a limited
 
02:51:46.490 --> 02:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
capabilities to trade power very
 
02:51:49.130 --> 02:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
effectively between utility service
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
territories and across networks across
 
02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
state lines and so over the last couple
 
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
of decades we've seen a concerted effort
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
to improve those interconnections reduce
 
02:52:04.190 --> 02:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
what we call a congestion on the
 
02:52:06.170 --> 02:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
transmission lines and same thing as as
 
02:52:08.990 --> 02:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
on a highway open up create more Avenues
 
02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to deliver power and
 
02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately provide the lowest cost
 
02:52:16.429 --> 02:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
resource across a wider footprint all of
 
02:52:19.309 --> 02:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
that is to the good and and write an
 
02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate investment on that that side
 
02:52:23.570 --> 02:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
of the system however I also think that
 
02:52:25.849 --> 02:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
one of the unintended consequences that
 
02:52:27.650 --> 02:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've seen coming out of restructuring
 
02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
is that the only place now for utilities
 
02:52:34.309 --> 02:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
to earn higher revenues is in the
 
02:52:37.010 --> 02:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
investment on transmission and
 
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
distribution on those polls and wires
 
02:52:41.750 --> 02:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
and in a system in which they are
 
02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
virtually guaranteed anywhere from eight
 
02:52:46.490 --> 02:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
to twelve percent rates of return for
 
02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
every dollar spent I think there is a
 
02:52:50.929 --> 02:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
natural incentive
 
02:52:53.929 --> 02:52:53.939 align:start position:0%
for driving more and more investment
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
there and part of our concern and reason
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
for highlighting it here is that when we
 
02:53:02.450 --> 02:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
look at the overall Bill impacts and and
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
the costs that have increased for
 
02:53:08.150 --> 02:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
Consumer uh over the period of time we
 
02:53:09.889 --> 02:53:09.899 align:start position:0%
see that portion of the bill
 
02:53:12.950 --> 02:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
consistently rise in a way that it
 
02:53:16.429 --> 02:53:16.439 align:start position:0%
hadn't uh up until this point
 
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
and frankly deserving of sharper
 
02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
oversight and and consideration
 
02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:23.630 align:start position:0%
oversight and and consideration
follow-up

02:53:23.630 --> 02:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
blow up
 
02:53:28.370 --> 02:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
um can you put any kind of
 
02:53:32.090 --> 02:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
um estimate on how much of the 140
 
02:53:34.969 --> 02:53:34.979 align:start position:0%
dollars currently
 
02:53:39.110 --> 02:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
was due to you know this um
 
02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
let's just say desire for profit
 
02:53:44.450 --> 02:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately cannot give you a
 
02:53:46.610 --> 02:53:46.620 align:start position:0%
straight answer on that one I I don't
 
02:53:46.620 --> 02:53:51.110 align:start position:0%
straight answer on that one I I don't
know

02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:54.050 --> 02:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
02:53:55.490 --> 02:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question Dan it's nice to see
 
02:53:57.950 --> 02:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
you again
 
02:53:59.570 --> 02:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of discussion I've
 
02:54:01.190 --> 02:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
had talks with you and this in the past
 
02:54:03.410 --> 02:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen and after
 
02:54:05.870 --> 02:54:05.880 align:start position:0%
post Mystic now we know Mystic I guess
 
02:54:07.790 --> 02:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
is scheduled to close they're an RMR
 
02:54:10.370 --> 02:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
plant now excuse me
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
a year from next spring I guess and that
 
02:54:15.410 --> 02:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
leaves us with the district gas facility
 
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
where about 60 percent of their product
 
02:54:21.170 --> 02:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
is sold to Mystic so that goes away uh
 
02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
that that market goes away for them can
 
02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
miss can the district facility stay and
 
02:54:28.250 --> 02:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't I believe that just leaves
 
02:54:31.250 --> 02:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
us with uh canaport and in the offshore
 
02:54:33.349 --> 02:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
terminal both are very limited in the
 
02:54:35.809 --> 02:54:35.819 align:start position:0%
amount of LNG they can provide so what
 
02:54:38.929 --> 02:54:38.939 align:start position:0%
what are the options for LNG post when
 
02:54:41.330 --> 02:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
after Mystic closes
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure thank you and and good to see you
 
02:54:44.870 --> 02:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington uh and for the
 
02:54:46.370 --> 02:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the group
 
02:54:49.610 --> 02:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
um uh the Mystic power plant is located
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
in Everett Massachusetts just North of
 
02:54:53.450 --> 02:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
Boston it is the second largest power
 
02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
plant in all of New England and natural
 
02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
plant in all of New England and natural
gas

02:54:55.910 --> 02:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
gas
 
02:54:58.849 --> 02:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
um fired plant that uh is one of the
 
02:55:00.410 --> 02:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
most unique facilities in the United
 
02:55:03.889 --> 02:55:03.899 align:start position:0%
States because it is co-located with a
 
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
liquefied natural gas import facility
 
02:55:09.290 --> 02:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
um which historically has been called
 
02:55:11.929 --> 02:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
distrogas for years and years and years
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
these were two separate facilities owned
 
02:55:16.190 --> 02:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
by two separate companies more recently
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
they have been purchased by by the same
 
02:55:21.490 --> 02:55:21.500 align:start position:0%
company Constellation Energy
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
and uh several years ago
 
02:55:27.889 --> 02:55:27.899 align:start position:0%
constellation announced that the Mystic
 
02:55:30.769 --> 02:55:30.779 align:start position:0%
power plant was no longer economic and
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
sought to retire the facility now in
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
power generation unlike just about every
 
02:55:40.849 --> 02:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
other commodity uh in that exists in our
 
02:55:43.790 --> 02:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
account economy you don't get to just
 
02:55:47.510 --> 02:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
decide to close uh there there is a a
 
02:55:50.929 --> 02:55:50.939 align:start position:0%
regulatory and a market process that has
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
to go forward and ISO New England
 
02:55:55.130 --> 02:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
determined that the Mystic Generating
 
02:55:57.290 --> 02:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
Station was necessary for reliability
 
02:56:00.889 --> 02:56:00.899 align:start position:0%
and so Mystic is now in um in the middle
 
02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
of a two-year what's called reliability
 
02:56:05.710 --> 02:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
must run or cost of service contract
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
specifically for reliability part of the
 
02:56:11.750 --> 02:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
impetus for that was to sustain the
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
operations of the LNG import facility of
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
which Mystic is Far and Away the largest
 
02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
single customer that contract with
 
02:56:24.130 --> 02:56:24.140 align:start position:0%
Mystic expires on May 31st 2024
 
02:56:27.710 --> 02:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
and there is massive uncertainty of what
 
02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
happens after that ends what I I do
 
02:56:33.769 --> 02:56:33.779 align:start position:0%
believe and certainly my organization
 
02:56:36.050 --> 02:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
supports and I hear a broad consensus
 
02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
across the market is that the power
 
02:56:40.429 --> 02:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
plant itself for electric reliability
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
will no longer be needed
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
to sustain operations
 
02:56:48.950 --> 02:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
the discussion then quickly flips well
 
02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
what happens to distr what happens to
 
02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
that Everett LNG Marine Terminal and
 
02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
there is a broad belief that for a
 
02:56:59.330 --> 02:56:59.340 align:start position:0%
combination of natural gas reliability
 
02:57:01.750 --> 02:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
on the gas utility and natural gas
 
02:57:05.150 --> 02:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
Interstate pipeline system and to
 
02:57:07.130 --> 02:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
provide gas to serve other power
 
02:57:09.710 --> 02:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
generators across the region that it may
 
02:57:12.650 --> 02:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
be necessary for reliability and then
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
the question is what do we do and so I
 
02:57:17.210 --> 02:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
can tell you this is one of the most
 
02:57:19.130 --> 02:57:19.140 align:start position:0%
active conversations that we are having
 
02:57:23.150 --> 02:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
right now with ISO New England with the
 
02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
individual states we're having
 
02:57:26.570 --> 02:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
conversations with the sununu
 
02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
administration as well as now the Healey
 
02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
Administration in Massachusetts around
 
02:57:32.090 --> 02:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
much of this
 
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
I do think that to the degree that a
 
02:57:36.650 --> 02:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
solution is necessary for the LNG
 
02:57:39.349 --> 02:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
facility it does come back to this
 
02:57:41.090 --> 02:57:41.100 align:start position:0%
combination of natural gas and
 
02:57:45.290 --> 02:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
electricity on the natural gas side that
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
LNG import facility is providing
 
02:57:49.730 --> 02:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
pressure Services essentially making
 
02:57:52.010 --> 02:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
sure that there's enough gas on the
 
02:57:54.710 --> 02:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
pipeline system that the flows that
 
02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally come west to east can come
 
02:57:59.150 --> 02:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
in being able to refill the pipeline
 
02:58:01.610 --> 02:58:01.620 align:start position:0%
system east to west keeps the pressure
 
02:58:03.889 --> 02:58:03.899 align:start position:0%
on the pipeline going high enough that
 
02:58:06.170 --> 02:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
you can actually flow more molecules on
 
02:58:09.290 --> 02:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
onto the the network overall those
 
02:58:12.050 --> 02:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
reliability services today are not
 
02:58:14.630 --> 02:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
compensated they are being taken for
 
02:58:17.570 --> 02:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
free by the natural gas pipelines and
 
02:58:19.849 --> 02:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
the local Distribution Company the the
 
02:58:23.030 --> 02:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
gas utility Network outside of Boston I
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
think that's not right at the same time
 
02:58:30.530 --> 02:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
we also recognize that there is a
 
02:58:32.769 --> 02:58:32.779 align:start position:0%
heightened premium on winter electric
 
02:58:37.429 --> 02:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
reliability and as part of that the LNG
 
02:58:39.769 --> 02:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
as a fuel for natural gas fire
 
02:58:39.779 --> 02:58:41.290 align:start position:0%
as a fuel for natural gas fire
generation

02:58:41.290 --> 02:58:41.300 align:start position:0%
generation
 
02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
serves as as a really attractive swing
 
02:58:46.670 --> 02:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
resource that can be there for those
 
02:58:50.210 --> 02:58:50.220 align:start position:0%
Peak periods right now that what I call
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
more premium electric reliability
 
02:58:55.130 --> 02:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
service is also not fully compensated in
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
the market and so I think it's this
 
02:58:58.730 --> 02:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
two-pronged approach on the one hand
 
02:59:03.130 --> 02:59:03.140 align:start position:0%
working to have the the gas industry
 
02:59:05.389 --> 02:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
compensate for the services that they
 
02:59:07.250 --> 02:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
receive and that are necessary for the
 
02:59:10.010 --> 02:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
reliability on the gas system while also
 
02:59:12.790 --> 02:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
working with ISO New England and others
 
02:59:15.490 --> 02:59:15.500 align:start position:0%
to modify the electricity Market
 
02:59:18.889 --> 02:59:18.899 align:start position:0%
particularly around how we how we credit
 
02:59:22.010 --> 02:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
the reliability Services of individual
 
02:59:24.309 --> 02:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
types of power generation facilities
 
02:59:27.889 --> 02:59:27.899 align:start position:0%
that can then facilitate individual
 
02:59:29.690 --> 02:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
power plants Contracting for some of
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
that gas commodity that may be necessary
 
02:59:35.469 --> 02:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
on the electric reliability end but
 
02:59:37.610 --> 02:59:37.620 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington as you pointed
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
out time is short on all of this and um
 
02:59:43.910 --> 02:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
the solutions are not simple and they
 
02:59:46.730 --> 02:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
require fairly novel coordination across
 
02:59:49.309 --> 02:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
industries that as much as I think the
 
02:59:51.769 --> 02:59:51.779 align:start position:0%
public links
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
natural gas and electricity is Just
 
02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
Energy and and of course we talk to each
 
02:59:56.040 --> 02:59:57.769 align:start position:0%
Energy and and of course we talk to each
other

02:59:57.769 --> 02:59:57.779 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:59:59.450 --> 02:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
these industries have grown up very
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
separately and do not always play very
 
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
well together and right now uh we have
 
03:00:06.590 --> 03:00:06.600 align:start position:0%
to we have to get this right and we are
 
03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
focused very much on doing it so I
 
03:00:09.530 --> 03:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
apologize for the very long-winded
 
03:00:10.790 --> 03:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
answer but wanted to provide that
 
03:00:13.429 --> 03:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
context follow-up no no thank you that
 
03:00:14.750 --> 03:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
was the answer I was looking for was a
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
complete one thank you very much you did
 
03:00:18.889 --> 03:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
mention about being compensated for uh
 
03:00:20.090 --> 03:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
electric generators were you talking
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
about generators have got firm gas that
 
03:00:24.349 --> 03:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
they would be like paid some kind of a
 
03:00:26.690 --> 03:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
bonus for having firm gas and if if
 
03:00:28.010 --> 03:00:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's what you're referring to would
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
that be covered under the new winter
 
03:00:32.570 --> 03:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
reliability program it's starting in two
 
03:00:35.090 --> 03:00:35.100 align:start position:0%
years or I guess so
 
03:00:37.790 --> 03:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
um uh yes to the first part of the
 
03:00:39.650 --> 03:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
answer which is to firm up that that
 
03:00:41.210 --> 03:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
fuel supply
 
03:00:43.910 --> 03:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and and create more of a capability
 
03:00:47.330 --> 03:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
for operational certainty that
 
03:00:49.550 --> 03:00:49.560 align:start position:0%
um in those type periods you can really
 
03:00:51.889 --> 03:00:51.899 align:start position:0%
call on each of these individual
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
facilities the compensation we're
 
03:00:55.790 --> 03:00:55.800 align:start position:0%
looking at is actually through the
 
03:00:58.610 --> 03:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market the the auction
 
03:01:00.290 --> 03:01:00.300 align:start position:0%
that happens once a year for a
 
03:01:02.650 --> 03:01:02.660 align:start position:0%
commitment three years into the future
 
03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
it would be through there's an uh over
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
the last year we've been working with
 
03:01:09.410 --> 03:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
ISO New England through a process that's
 
03:01:11.150 --> 03:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
called the resource capacity
 
03:01:14.809 --> 03:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
accreditation improvements RCA and it is
 
03:01:17.630 --> 03:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
through that where we sharpened the
 
03:01:19.550 --> 03:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
reliability criteria of individual
 
03:01:23.630 --> 03:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
facilities and and then allow more of
 
03:01:26.090 --> 03:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
the cost for this type of a a premium
 
03:01:28.429 --> 03:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
fuel purchase to be recovered in that
 
03:01:28.439 --> 03:01:30.530 align:start position:0%
fuel purchase to be recovered in that
market

03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:01:31.849 --> 03:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:35.090 --> 03:01:35.100 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
03:01:38.150 --> 03:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:01:40.670 --> 03:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
you indicated Great Value was seen in in
 
03:01:44.570 --> 03:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
the competitive market for uh these
 
03:01:46.969 --> 03:01:46.979 align:start position:0%
wholesale uh
 
03:01:49.910 --> 03:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
supply of of power and you also
 
03:01:53.210 --> 03:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
indicated there's room for growth uh so
 
03:01:55.730 --> 03:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
could you articulate some of those areas
 
03:01:57.769 --> 03:01:57.779 align:start position:0%
for room for growth and whether or not
 
03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
there might be incentives or
 
03:02:04.250 --> 03:02:04.260 align:start position:0%
opportunities for legislation to further
 
03:02:07.010 --> 03:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
facilitate that yes thank you for that
 
03:02:09.170 --> 03:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
so one is this resource capacity
 
03:02:12.910 --> 03:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
accreditation we need to sharpen how we
 
03:02:15.889 --> 03:02:15.899 align:start position:0%
value the the reliability services that
 
03:02:18.769 --> 03:02:18.779 align:start position:0%
are being provided a a second product is
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we have seen a a huge growth in
 
03:02:26.450 --> 03:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
recent years in uh the amount of more
 
03:02:29.330 --> 03:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
weather dependent uh generation sources
 
03:02:31.010 --> 03:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
on the system this is everything from
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
rooftop solar to the really large solar
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
facilities to win farms and they provide
 
03:02:40.429 --> 03:02:40.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of value for some of the the
 
03:02:42.650 --> 03:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
services they provide they also create
 
03:02:44.929 --> 03:02:44.939 align:start position:0%
different requirements on the system in
 
03:02:46.429 --> 03:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
particular in the moments in which
 
03:02:49.010 --> 03:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly they they are not able to
 
03:02:51.170 --> 03:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
perform because of unforeseen weather
 
03:02:55.130 --> 03:02:55.140 align:start position:0%
events it is then the the capability to
 
03:02:58.130 --> 03:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
turn on and off really fast to backfill
 
03:02:58.140 --> 03:02:59.030 align:start position:0%
turn on and off really fast to backfill
that

03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:01.190 --> 03:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
um that is something that today uh the
 
03:03:03.469 --> 03:03:03.479 align:start position:0%
market is not well designed to help me
 
03:03:05.630 --> 03:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
to integrate those those facilities a
 
03:03:07.130 --> 03:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
little bit better
 
03:03:08.870 --> 03:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
um it's essentially holding more in
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
reserve that can quickly come online
 
03:03:14.210 --> 03:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
that type of a reserve product is kind
 
03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
of next in line in our discussions and I
 
03:03:19.250 --> 03:03:19.260 align:start position:0%
think will help facilitate the future of
 
03:03:22.130 --> 03:03:22.140 align:start position:0%
this Market a lot the third major area
 
03:03:24.170 --> 03:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
is then
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
um one of the items that's been
 
03:03:29.570 --> 03:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
um one of the the frankly most
 
03:03:31.849 --> 03:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
existential issues we've faced in these
 
03:03:33.410 --> 03:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
electricity markets where for the last
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
25 years we've relied on these daily
 
03:03:39.230 --> 03:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
energy markets and these you know once
 
03:03:41.570 --> 03:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
annual capacity auctions to drive the
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
financing and development of facilities
 
03:03:47.210 --> 03:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
in recent years however most of the New
 
03:03:49.690 --> 03:03:49.700 align:start position:0%
England states have started pursuing
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
individual multi-decade contracts for
 
03:03:55.250 --> 03:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
individual types of facilities and here
 
03:03:58.370 --> 03:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
you can think of Canadian Hydro offshore
 
03:04:01.610 --> 03:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
wind onshore wind a lot of resources
 
03:04:04.429 --> 03:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
that have been chosen through bodies
 
03:04:07.490 --> 03:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
like this across the region to try and
 
03:04:09.170 --> 03:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
and bring into the market in a way
 
03:04:11.389 --> 03:04:11.399 align:start position:0%
that's not happening today on a on a
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
purely economic basis the the challenge
 
03:04:17.030 --> 03:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
with that however is by having
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
essentially a a bifurcated system where
 
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
one part of the system benefits from
 
03:04:28.190 --> 03:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
state-backed 20 30-year contracts and
 
03:04:30.230 --> 03:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of the system has to live and
 
03:04:34.070 --> 03:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
die in these daily markets uh is it is
 
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
shrinking the amount of potential
 
03:04:38.389 --> 03:04:38.399 align:start position:0%
revenue for those other competitive
 
03:04:41.630 --> 03:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
resources many of which like Mystic may
 
03:04:43.790 --> 03:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
still be necessary for reliability but
 
03:04:47.090 --> 03:04:47.100 align:start position:0%
aren't able to recover enough costs what
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
we I think the the next big challenge
 
03:04:51.530 --> 03:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
for the region and and for bodies like
 
03:04:53.630 --> 03:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
this is to figure out how do we better
 
03:04:56.030 --> 03:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
integrate those State policies for
 
03:04:58.490 --> 03:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
individual resource types more directly
 
03:05:01.450 --> 03:05:01.460 align:start position:0%
into the market in a more sustainable
 
03:05:04.250 --> 03:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
competitive market structure we haven't
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
gotten it right yet and there are
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
different solutions to that but it comes
 
03:05:12.530 --> 03:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
down to what are the policy choices
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
driving those long-term contracts in a
 
03:05:17.630 --> 03:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
state like Massachusetts it's largely
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
being predicated on decarbonization well
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
as a markets guy I then say the solution
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
to that is uh price carbon in a
 
03:05:30.410 --> 03:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
meaningful manner to drive any of these
 
03:05:31.610 --> 03:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
Investments that you want and then
 
03:05:33.349 --> 03:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
discipline the rest of the market
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
if however the policy is driving some of
 
03:05:37.849 --> 03:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
those procurements are something else
 
03:05:39.950 --> 03:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
then we need to articulate exactly what
 
03:05:41.330 --> 03:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
that is and figure out if there's a
 
03:05:43.429 --> 03:05:43.439 align:start position:0%
product that then can again be embedded
 
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
into the Bro the market uh more broadly
 
03:05:50.030 --> 03:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's a really hard thing to do but
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's to me the next big hole in the
 
03:06:01.309 --> 03:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:02.870 --> 03:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thanks for taking my
 
03:06:02.880 --> 03:06:03.889 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thanks for taking my
question

03:06:03.889 --> 03:06:03.899 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:06:05.269 --> 03:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to go back to something that
 
03:06:06.830 --> 03:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
you said when we were talking about the
 
03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
increase in transmission rates you
 
03:06:10.849 --> 03:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
mentioned that utilities have a
 
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
guaranteed rate of return on these
 
03:06:14.330 --> 03:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
Investments um can you speak a little
 
03:06:16.969 --> 03:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
bit more to where that guarantee comes
 
03:06:16.979 --> 03:06:17.570 align:start position:0%
bit more to where that guarantee comes
from

03:06:17.570 --> 03:06:17.580 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:06:18.550 --> 03:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
um and where the money comes from
 
03:06:20.809 --> 03:06:20.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and
 
03:06:24.410 --> 03:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
um uh I I want to uh make sure I'm I'm
 
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
clear on this one it is a and if I
 
03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
didn't say this at the beginning uh my
 
03:06:33.110 --> 03:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
apologies a virtual guarantee there is
 
03:06:35.389 --> 03:06:35.399 align:start position:0%
still a a regulatory process through
 
03:06:36.889 --> 03:06:36.899 align:start position:0%
that but
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
um that comes in in two forms one is on
 
03:06:42.349 --> 03:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
the distribution side of the system that
 
03:06:44.090 --> 03:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
is fully regulated
 
03:06:45.769 --> 03:06:45.779 align:start position:0%
um by each state in their regulatory
 
03:06:47.889 --> 03:06:47.899 align:start position:0%
body in New Hampshire it's the puc
 
03:06:52.190 --> 03:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
through that as long as that facility is
 
03:06:54.889 --> 03:06:54.899 align:start position:0%
used and useful and seen as a prudent
 
03:06:58.250 --> 03:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
investment on the system uh the costs of
 
03:07:01.330 --> 03:07:01.340 align:start position:0%
that are then recovered under rates
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
and a what is seen as a a reasonable
 
03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
rate of return put in place
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
historically that again has has ranged
 
03:07:13.809 --> 03:07:13.819 align:start position:0%
more or less 8 to 12 percent
 
03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:18.080 align:start position:0%
we see the higher end of that that
 
03:07:21.170 --> 03:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
Revenue side come actually on the
 
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
federal end where going back to the
 
03:07:27.230 --> 03:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
energy Policy Act of 2005 passed by
 
03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
Congress there was an explicit policy of
 
03:07:32.469 --> 03:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
the United States to try and encourage
 
03:07:35.469 --> 03:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
more transmission investment
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
that then set bonus points for revenue
 
03:07:43.070 --> 03:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
and recovery of of those large
 
03:07:43.080 --> 03:07:44.870 align:start position:0%
and recovery of of those large
Investments

03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
03:07:46.969 --> 03:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
again all of that makes sense we need to
 
03:07:48.650 --> 03:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
invest in infrastructure particularly
 
03:07:50.889 --> 03:07:50.899 align:start position:0%
aging infrastructure in this country
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
however I think that the concern becomes
 
03:07:56.929 --> 03:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
as as we are now in year 18 of of that
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
policy to what degree is that still
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not and to what degree is
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
there any competition for those types of
 
03:08:09.050 --> 03:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
resources or not and here to me you know
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
the starkest part of that graph that
 
03:08:11.399 --> 03:08:12.429 align:start position:0%
the starkest part of that graph that
that

03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:15.349 --> 03:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
is why we put it in here is the
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
exponential growth that that we have
 
03:08:17.520 --> 03:08:18.429 align:start position:0%
exponential growth that that we have
seen

03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
seen
 
03:08:23.210 --> 03:08:23.220 align:start position:0%
and a uh a concern about what that means
 
03:08:25.250 --> 03:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
on transparency on electric rates
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
because we do hear so often concerns
 
03:08:31.849 --> 03:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
about bills and and consumer impacts we
 
03:08:33.050 --> 03:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that it is
 
03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:37.309 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that it is
transparent

03:08:37.309 --> 03:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:39.889 --> 03:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
uh okay who's next uh representative
 
03:08:42.650 --> 03:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
Munn's representative Summers rather
 
03:08:44.210 --> 03:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:08:45.710 --> 03:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:08:46.849 --> 03:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
um this has to do with what you just
 
03:08:48.530 --> 03:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
mentioned there earlier about future
 
03:08:51.170 --> 03:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
capacity and I asked this advice on New
 
03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
England actually this morning as well
 
03:08:55.010 --> 03:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
but with the uh have you seen an
 
03:08:57.050 --> 03:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
increase in price or at least a floor to
 
03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
the price caused by uh moper uh the
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
minimum offer price and can you explain
 
03:09:04.670 --> 03:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
what if it is and how it's been affected
 
03:09:04.680 --> 03:09:06.349 align:start position:0%
what if it is and how it's been affected
sure

03:09:06.349 --> 03:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:09:08.690 --> 03:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
um uh so again if if you'll bear with me
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
I'll give a little bit of the context of
 
03:09:12.769 --> 03:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
of moper the minimum offer price Rule
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
and then and then uh try to answer your
 
03:09:16.790 --> 03:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
question so uh the minimum offer price
 
03:09:16.800 --> 03:09:17.750 align:start position:0%
question so uh the minimum offer price
rule

03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
um is a a rule in place in the the
 
03:09:23.450 --> 03:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market that that annual
 
03:09:25.550 --> 03:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
capacity auction usually held in
 
03:09:25.560 --> 03:09:26.690 align:start position:0%
capacity auction usually held in
February

03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
February
 
03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
um for three years into the future what
 
03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
it is designed to do is ensure that
 
03:09:33.410 --> 03:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
facilities that do have an outside
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream guaranteed by a state
 
03:09:37.849 --> 03:09:37.859 align:start position:0%
like those long-term contracts I was
 
03:09:39.769 --> 03:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
speaking about earlier that they are
 
03:09:42.050 --> 03:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
bidding what is seen as their true
 
03:09:45.050 --> 03:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
economic costs into the market and put
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
them on a relatively equal footing for
 
03:09:50.090 --> 03:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
with all the other resources that do not
 
03:09:53.269 --> 03:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
receive that same in my word subsidy or
 
03:09:55.370 --> 03:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
outside Revenue stream that that is
 
03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
guaranteed by a state
 
03:09:58.969 --> 03:09:58.979 align:start position:0%
what the minimum offer price rule then
 
03:10:01.730 --> 03:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
does is say for
 
03:10:05.870 --> 03:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
a Wind Facility or a gas plant or a new
 
03:10:08.690 --> 03:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
any other type of facility that has that
 
03:10:11.150 --> 03:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream here is what we believe
 
03:10:14.330 --> 03:10:14.340 align:start position:0%
is your economically Justified price
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
if you as an individual facility believe
 
03:10:19.190 --> 03:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
that your economic price absent that
 
03:10:20.570 --> 03:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
outside Revenue stream is actually lower
 
03:10:22.370 --> 03:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
you can demonstrate that you can go to
 
03:10:23.870 --> 03:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
the market Monitor and demonstrate that
 
03:10:26.090 --> 03:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
so it is not a it is not a floor it is
 
03:10:28.910 --> 03:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
not a block it is a screen through which
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
they must pass if they can can go lower
 
03:10:35.809 --> 03:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
um however the the ultimate impact of
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that has been that for a number of of
 
03:10:39.950 --> 03:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
resources that do have an outside
 
03:10:42.769 --> 03:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream a subsidy
 
03:10:45.250 --> 03:10:45.260 align:start position:0%
um their their capacity Market offers
 
03:10:49.010 --> 03:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
have been higher because with that
 
03:10:51.410 --> 03:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream they would likely be
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
what's called price takers in the
 
03:10:54.410 --> 03:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
capacity Market they would be
 
03:10:56.330 --> 03:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
indifferent to whatever Revenue they
 
03:10:57.950 --> 03:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
receive in in the capacity Market
 
03:10:59.870 --> 03:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
because they make all their money
 
03:11:02.570 --> 03:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and so that has meant
 
03:11:03.889 --> 03:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
that for many of those resources they
 
03:11:06.410 --> 03:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
have not been selected as the most
 
03:11:08.750 --> 03:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
efficient economic resources in that
 
03:11:08.760 --> 03:11:09.610 align:start position:0%
efficient economic resources in that
market

03:11:09.610 --> 03:11:09.620 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:11:13.309 --> 03:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
through that the criticism has been from
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
many that that moper the minimum offer
 
03:11:18.170 --> 03:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
price rule has has propped up capacity
 
03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
prices and kept out certain resources
 
03:11:22.849 --> 03:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
from being recognized in the capacity
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
Market I will tell you I do not share
 
03:11:29.450 --> 03:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
that belief but my belief
 
03:11:33.530 --> 03:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
uh put aside moper's going away
 
03:11:36.050 --> 03:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
um and in fact uh this year's capacity
 
03:11:38.809 --> 03:11:38.819 align:start position:0%
auction is is the first in which we see
 
03:11:42.590 --> 03:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
an unwinding of mober so this year
 
03:11:46.370 --> 03:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
um uh I believe it is 300 megawatts of
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
subsidized resources will not have to
 
03:11:51.650 --> 03:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
pass through them the mober screen for
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
any resources Beyond those 300 megawatts
 
03:11:55.550 --> 03:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
they still have that screen in place
 
03:11:58.730 --> 03:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
then in next year's auction 400
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
megawatts do not have to go through that
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
screen get what's called a moper
 
03:12:05.630 --> 03:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
exemption plus any unused megawatts from
 
03:12:07.969 --> 03:12:07.979 align:start position:0%
this year so 700 megawatts total between
 
03:12:11.090 --> 03:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
the two years and then finally in the
 
03:12:12.889 --> 03:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
auction that is to be held in February
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
of 2025 that will be the first in which
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
we have no moper whatsoever and it is in
 
03:12:22.730 --> 03:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
that market in which the expectation is
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
that any resource regardless of whether
 
03:12:27.650 --> 03:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
it has an outside Revenue stream or not
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
will be able to all offer as low as it
 
03:12:34.250 --> 03:12:34.260 align:start position:0%
would like however there will still be
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
substantial oversight and mitigation as
 
03:12:39.769 --> 03:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
to how high they can bid
 
03:12:42.349 --> 03:12:42.359 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question
 
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question
 
03:12:50.690 --> 03:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'd just like to
 
03:12:52.250 --> 03:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
follow up on that
 
03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
um you know you you mentioned several
 
03:12:58.030 --> 03:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
times outside revenue streams subsidies
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
has there been any work done to identify
 
03:13:04.790 --> 03:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh the extent of these outside revenue
 
03:13:07.389 --> 03:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
streams by
 
03:13:13.070 --> 03:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes the longer
 
03:13:17.690 --> 03:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
answer is it's very complicated so there
 
03:13:19.570 --> 03:13:19.580 align:start position:0%
are the direct
 
03:13:22.370 --> 03:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
subsidies and outside payments that take
 
03:13:25.870 --> 03:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
the form largely of long-term contracts
 
03:13:29.090 --> 03:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
mandated by individual state state
 
03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
governments that are then implemented by
 
03:13:34.870 --> 03:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
the the state utilities collectively
 
03:13:37.490 --> 03:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
across New England the expectation is
 
03:13:41.090 --> 03:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
that over the next several years of the
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
roughly 28 000 megawatts of electric
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
demand in New England roughly 10 000
 
03:13:51.530 --> 03:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
megawatts of that demand will be taken
 
03:13:54.050 --> 03:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
up by these long-term contracts that
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
that are mandated by state governments
 
03:14:00.050 --> 03:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
there is of course the the next level of
 
03:14:04.150 --> 03:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
of subsidy that happens further Upstream
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
for individual fuel technology and
 
03:14:10.670 --> 03:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
resource types that largely happens at
 
03:14:13.730 --> 03:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
at the the federal level um and that's
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
where I I know that accountings of those
 
03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
have occurred I do not have uh those
 
03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
numbers handy with me right now
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
03:14:26.210 --> 03:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think you were getting it what
 
03:14:28.250 --> 03:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
I was trying to get at I think at the at
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
the last there I mean I guess what I'm
 
03:14:31.910 --> 03:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm wondering is there anything
 
03:14:33.410 --> 03:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
that says
 
03:14:39.290 --> 03:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
um uh Power generated by gas has this
 
03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
kind of subsidy power generated by
 
03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
nuclear has this kind of subsidy you
 
03:14:45.290 --> 03:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
know wind Etc
 
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
I am confident that that analysis exists
 
03:14:51.070 --> 03:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
but I do not have it with me
 
03:14:54.230 --> 03:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:14:56.809 --> 03:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question getting back to the
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market I'm trying to
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
remember how this all works again and
 
03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:02.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure but how is it are
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
they different types of resources
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
treated differently by that I mean uh
 
03:15:09.290 --> 03:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
let's say a dispatchable resource bids
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
says I'm 100 megawatts and then if they
 
03:15:15.530 --> 03:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
called on to deliver the 100 megawatts
 
03:15:17.389 --> 03:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
they have to face the pay for
 
03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
performance and if they don't pay uh
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
they don't deliver 100 megawatts they're
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
going to get penalized now what about an
 
03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
intermittent resource let's say 100
 
03:15:28.130 --> 03:15:28.140 align:start position:0%
megawatt nameplate wind maybe they bid
 
03:15:30.769 --> 03:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
in 30 megawatts but since it's
 
03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
intermittent are they treated the same
 
03:15:34.969 --> 03:15:34.979 align:start position:0%
way in the forward capacity Market
 
03:15:38.570 --> 03:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
so for each individual power plant or or
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
generating resource they have their
 
03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
capacity Supply obligation that is the
 
03:15:47.870 --> 03:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
amount that is being relied on from a
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
reliability standpoint and that is what
 
03:15:52.490 --> 03:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity Market is it is our
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
most fundamental reliability market so
 
03:15:57.950 --> 03:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
for a facility under this example that
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
let's say it's it's name click plate
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
capacity is a hundred megawatts but its
 
03:16:07.070 --> 03:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
capacity Supply obligation the portion
 
03:16:09.170 --> 03:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
of that facility that was selected in
 
03:16:10.849 --> 03:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
the forward capacity markets is only 30
 
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
megawatts then the market is only
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
counting on it for those 30 megawatts
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
and any amount that it it doesn't
 
03:16:24.530 --> 03:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
perform above those 30 let's say it only
 
03:16:27.050 --> 03:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
delivers those 30 megawatts during a
 
03:16:29.150 --> 03:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
shortage period or a very stress period
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
on the market no it is not penalized at
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
all it is seen as having met its
 
03:16:36.230 --> 03:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
obligation in the expectation of the
 
03:16:40.010 --> 03:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
market however for a facility that
 
03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
clears all 100 megawatts of its 100
 
03:16:44.690 --> 03:16:44.700 align:start position:0%
megawatt capability and has a 100
 
03:16:47.210 --> 03:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
megawatt capacity Supply obligation but
 
03:16:49.550 --> 03:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
they only deliver 30 megawatts during
 
03:16:52.610 --> 03:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
this stress period of event then those
 
03:16:55.849 --> 03:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
remaining 70 megawatts are penalized and
 
03:16:58.309 --> 03:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
penalized severely for their
 
03:17:00.290 --> 03:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
non-performance their their inability to
 
03:17:02.090 --> 03:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
be there
 
03:17:05.090 --> 03:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
follow up like I guess I'm trying to
 
03:17:07.610 --> 03:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
figure is on let's concentrate on the
 
03:17:09.410 --> 03:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
wind the 30 megawatt so it was 100
 
03:17:11.450 --> 03:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
megawatt nameplate 30 megawatts it's
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
capacity Supply obligation was 30
 
03:17:15.349 --> 03:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
megawatts but on any given day maybe
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
producing 60 megawatts 70 megawatts and
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
another day it's 10 megawatts because 30
 
03:17:23.809 --> 03:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
is the average so we have a day where
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
the uh pay for performance comes into
 
03:17:28.370 --> 03:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
effect and the wind is only delivering
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
10 megawatts on that day are they judged
 
03:17:33.530 --> 03:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
on how they deliver on that day or they
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
do judged on some type of an average
 
03:17:42.170 --> 03:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
so with respect to how much is um uh
 
03:17:44.330 --> 03:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
selected under the forward capacity
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
Market it is the average it is
 
03:17:49.730 --> 03:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
um that that's what they are accredited
 
03:17:52.190 --> 03:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
from a capacity standpoint in terms of
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
penalties under uh the the pay for
 
03:17:57.710 --> 03:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
performance structure as it exists
 
03:18:00.410 --> 03:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
um they are then only judged by how they
 
03:18:03.650 --> 03:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
perform on that day and and it is
 
03:18:05.990 --> 03:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
actually coming back to that broader
 
03:18:08.590 --> 03:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
averaging that how do we actually
 
03:18:10.969 --> 03:18:10.979 align:start position:0%
designate how much the market should
 
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
rely on an individual facility on an
 
03:18:16.550 --> 03:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
individual resource type that's exactly
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
the issue we're trying to get at with
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
more granularity through this resource
 
03:18:23.210 --> 03:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
capacity accreditation process because
 
03:18:25.130 --> 03:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
right now it is a pretty blunt
 
03:18:25.140 --> 03:18:26.410 align:start position:0%
right now it is a pretty blunt
instrument

03:18:26.410 --> 03:18:26.420 align:start position:0%
instrument
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
and we need to get much more specific
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
and granular About It by individual
 
03:18:34.130 --> 03:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
technology and resource type and even
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
where it sits on the system and an
 
03:18:39.110 --> 03:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
ability to to perform
 
03:18:41.570 --> 03:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
uh representative monaster's question
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:18:43.979 --> 03:18:44.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:46.370 --> 03:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
I hope I didn't misunderstand something
 
03:18:49.250 --> 03:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
you said earlier and and and and perhaps
 
03:18:50.809 --> 03:18:50.819 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot and if I am I
 
03:18:50.819 --> 03:18:52.370 align:start position:0%
putting you on the spot and if I am I
apologize

03:18:52.370 --> 03:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
03:18:55.070 --> 03:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
um you I think said that
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of the industry industry's view
 
03:19:01.070 --> 03:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts overall policy
 
03:19:03.769 --> 03:19:03.779 align:start position:0%
objective is decarbonization
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes correct good
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
um does the industry have a similar view
 
03:19:12.110 --> 03:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I mean can you can you
 
03:19:14.090 --> 03:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
put what new your view of New
 
03:19:16.490 --> 03:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's policy objectives in a real
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
nugget like that so to to put it most
 
03:19:19.200 --> 03:19:20.750 align:start position:0%
nugget like that so to to put it most
bluntly

03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
bluntly
 
03:19:22.969 --> 03:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
um as I look across the region and again
 
03:19:25.150 --> 03:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
our our footprint is the the Six States
 
03:19:28.849 --> 03:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
I see it largely a north-south divide I
 
03:19:30.590 --> 03:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
see Massachusetts Rhode Island and
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
Connecticut largely being driven by
 
03:19:36.050 --> 03:19:36.060 align:start position:0%
decarbonization of course they want
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
reliability and of course they want
 
03:19:40.969 --> 03:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
um uh competitive pricing for their
 
03:19:43.309 --> 03:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
consumers but largely the driving force
 
03:19:45.950 --> 03:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
being decarbonization as a top-line
 
03:19:49.309 --> 03:19:49.319 align:start position:0%
policy standpoint and I look at a state
 
03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire as largely being
 
03:19:54.910 --> 03:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
driven by economics and affordability
 
03:19:58.730 --> 03:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
and it is the the challenges as we see
 
03:20:02.269 --> 03:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
it is that New England electrically is a
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
single market and yet we have six
 
03:20:08.570 --> 03:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
individual states with all the rights to
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
set their own policies and and resource
 
03:20:10.979 --> 03:20:11.710 align:start position:0%
set their own policies and and resource
mix

03:20:11.710 --> 03:20:11.720 align:start position:0%
mix
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
but trying to figure out a way to create
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
a common market and a balancing of all
 
03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:17.929 align:start position:0%
a common market and a balancing of all
that

03:20:17.929 --> 03:20:17.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:20:17.939 --> 03:20:19.969 align:start position:0%
that
follow-up

03:20:19.969 --> 03:20:19.979 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:20:19.979 --> 03:20:21.469 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

03:20:21.469 --> 03:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:20:21.479 --> 03:20:22.309 align:start position:0%
follow-up
um

03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
could you characterize Vermont and Maine
 
03:20:27.889 --> 03:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
just to complete the picture sure uh uh
 
03:20:31.790 --> 03:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
so so Maine is is frankly a funny blend
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think of New Hampshire and
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts of decarbonization is an
 
03:20:39.730 --> 03:20:39.740 align:start position:0%
explicit priority
 
03:20:43.070 --> 03:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
however it is less aggressive in its
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
Pursuit as we see in some of the the
 
03:20:47.690 --> 03:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
southern New England states
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
um Vermont is a very different and a
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
little bit of a funny Beast for us here
 
03:20:55.370 --> 03:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
in New England Vermont is the only state
 
03:20:56.809 --> 03:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
in the United States that does not have
 
03:20:58.790 --> 03:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
a utility scale power plant it is the
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
only state without a fossil fuel power
 
03:21:04.910 --> 03:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
plant and it by its nature then almost
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
entirely Imports its electricity Supply
 
03:21:09.889 --> 03:21:09.899 align:start position:0%
both from Quebec and actually the
 
03:21:12.290 --> 03:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Nuclear Station here under
 
03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
long-term contract
 
03:21:14.160 --> 03:21:14.990 align:start position:0%
long-term contract
um

03:21:14.990 --> 03:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:17.690 --> 03:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
I have a hard time putting Vermont in a
 
03:21:19.790 --> 03:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
single box it is also the lowest
 
03:21:21.769 --> 03:21:21.779 align:start position:0%
consumer of electricity of any state in
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Loki is recognized for a
 
03:21:30.230 --> 03:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman on the
 
03:21:31.670 --> 03:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
transmission costs in the transmission
 
03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
build it's kind of a double question one
 
03:21:36.830 --> 03:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
of them is with a guaranteed rate of
 
03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:38.090 align:start position:0%
of them is with a guaranteed rate of
return

03:21:38.090 --> 03:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
return
 
03:21:41.269 --> 03:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
um is there an incentive to over invest
 
03:21:43.610 --> 03:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
or over build and then the second
 
03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
question would be do these people when
 
03:21:50.510 --> 03:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
they building have any risk whatsoever
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
so to ask answer the the second part
 
03:21:57.530 --> 03:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
first uh the risk is extraordinarily low
 
03:21:59.929 --> 03:21:59.939 align:start position:0%
um to to eat the cost of of any
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
increases or
 
03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
um or delays as as part of that
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
transmission build out in terms of the
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the incentive to overbuild yes I I am
 
03:22:12.410 --> 03:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
concerned that there is absolutely that
 
03:22:15.950 --> 03:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
incentive and it puts a really
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
challenging burden on the regulator to
 
03:22:20.690 --> 03:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
be able to provide the necessary
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
oversight to hold all of those
 
03:22:27.290 --> 03:22:27.300 align:start position:0%
Investments to exactly what is necessary
 
03:22:30.769 --> 03:22:30.779 align:start position:0%
or what may be prudent and the concern
 
03:22:33.530 --> 03:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
being that as we look at some of those
 
03:22:37.309 --> 03:22:37.319 align:start position:0%
individual state regulatory entities do
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
they have the expertise and capability
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
to fully do that and I
 
03:22:46.190 --> 03:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
I think that is something that deserves
 
03:22:48.969 --> 03:22:48.979 align:start position:0%
closer inspection
 
03:22:52.190 --> 03:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
03:22:55.070 --> 03:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I'm wanting to
 
03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
refer back I think to
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative Munn's earlier question
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually and then all the way back to
 
03:23:02.990 --> 03:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas's
 
03:23:06.469 --> 03:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
question at the beginning where he
 
03:23:11.210 --> 03:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
asks and you responded about the um
 
03:23:14.330 --> 03:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
you know what's driving the price
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
the cost increases of course you know
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
we've talked about money in the last few
 
03:23:19.140 --> 03:23:20.150 align:start position:0%
we've talked about money in the last few
days

03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:23:24.110 --> 03:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
and it's you know plainly the the input
 
03:23:26.510 --> 03:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
costs you said the input costs to
 
03:23:29.929 --> 03:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
generators uh can you
 
03:23:32.809 --> 03:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
try and articulate the challenges that
 
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
you have in
 
03:23:38.750 --> 03:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
the design of these Market instruments
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
when you are
 
03:23:41.040 --> 03:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
when you are
um

03:23:43.010 --> 03:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
representing and our system is blending
 
03:23:49.729 --> 03:23:49.739 align:start position:0%
both kinds of generators where
 
03:23:49.739 --> 03:23:52.010 align:start position:0%
both kinds of generators where
with

03:23:52.010 --> 03:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
nuclear and fossil well fossil fuel
 
03:23:57.110 --> 03:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
generators mostly right that are
 
03:23:59.090 --> 03:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
dominating the market
 
03:24:02.269 --> 03:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
um there's significant input costs of
 
03:24:05.809 --> 03:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
fuel ongoing costs of fuel uh and
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously at the beginning there was
 
03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
Capital costs required to build those
 
03:24:13.610 --> 03:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
plants whereas with Renewables like
 
03:24:16.190 --> 03:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
solar and wind
 
03:24:19.370 --> 03:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
almost 100 percent of the cost is
 
03:24:22.190 --> 03:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
capital investment at the beginning and
 
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
almost no cost
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.950 --> 03:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's really challenging uh and you know
 
03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
if you look on a slide nine here we we
 
03:24:38.750 --> 03:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
try and break out what what is the fuel
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
mix that that was actually supplied in
 
03:24:42.410 --> 03:24:42.420 align:start position:0%
2021 and unfortunately we don't yet have
 
03:24:45.110 --> 03:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
the final numbers for 2022 so
 
03:24:47.570 --> 03:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
um bear with me on on a little bit
 
03:24:50.870 --> 03:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
um uh dated here but but if you look
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
um through it
 
03:24:54.530 --> 03:24:54.540 align:start position:0%
um yes you know natural gas is is Far
 
03:24:56.750 --> 03:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
and Away the largest single source of of
 
03:24:59.330 --> 03:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
generation as as part of that as a as a
 
03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel uh they have that that that
 
03:25:06.349 --> 03:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
marginal cost that uh that input cost is
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
fuel and when the price of natural gas
 
03:25:10.370 --> 03:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
goes up
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
um we we see that those costs go up
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatically on the flip side if
 
03:25:18.050 --> 03:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
you look at kind of that green wedge
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
Renewables the orange wedge nuclear for
 
03:25:23.210 --> 03:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
the most part and there are exceptions
 
03:25:26.450 --> 03:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
but for the most part those are very
 
03:25:28.969 --> 03:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
very low or even zero marginal cost
 
03:25:31.670 --> 03:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
resources their fuel is a negligible
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
portion of the operation of of those
 
03:25:37.729 --> 03:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
facilities that purple wedge net Imports
 
03:25:41.269 --> 03:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
that is mostly existing inner ties we
 
03:25:44.150 --> 03:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
have with Quebec and for the most part
 
03:25:46.210 --> 03:25:46.220 align:start position:0%
again speaking broadly
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
that is largely Hydro electric as is
 
03:25:50.340 --> 03:25:51.190 align:start position:0%
that is largely Hydro electric as is
actually

03:25:51.190 --> 03:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
most of that that renewal that green
 
03:25:57.290 --> 03:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
Renewables wedge in New England so if if
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
rough Justice numbers I I add together
 
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
the Renewables the net Imports and the
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
nuclear then I come out with actually a
 
03:26:07.130 --> 03:26:07.140 align:start position:0%
majority of the current system is
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
dispatched on a very low or even zero
 
03:26:11.929 --> 03:26:11.939 align:start position:0%
marginal cost basis
 
03:26:14.809 --> 03:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
um and from that I think in the energy
 
03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
markets consumer see enormous value
 
03:26:18.889 --> 03:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
because that that does hold that price
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
down and then really disciplines any
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
fossil fuel either natural gas or even
 
03:26:26.210 --> 03:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
the the very small portion of oil and
 
03:26:28.429 --> 03:26:28.439 align:start position:0%
coal that that is still relied on on
 
03:26:31.250 --> 03:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
this region to only the portion that is
 
03:26:33.290 --> 03:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
most efficient and most necessary to
 
03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
meet demand in any given period of time
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
but as we look forward I think what
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
you're asking is
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
a little bit more of a philosophical
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
question of we've got some resources
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
that have very very low marginal cost
 
03:26:49.610 --> 03:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
resources but the new ones have fairly
 
03:26:51.590 --> 03:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
High upfront Capital costs to come into
 
03:26:53.870 --> 03:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
the market we've got other resources
 
03:26:56.590 --> 03:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
that may have much higher marginal costs
 
03:26:59.690 --> 03:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
to perform in the market but relatively
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
low Capital cost to enter the market how
 
03:27:04.910 --> 03:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
do we make all that work
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
really delicately
 
03:27:09.349 --> 03:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
um and this is where
 
03:27:13.610 --> 03:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
um I I I don't believe we should rely on
 
03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
any one segment of our market and that
 
03:27:17.870 --> 03:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
is to say the energy Market is dictated
 
03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
by that marginal cost what is that final
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
fuel which then makes some of these
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels today based on the prices
 
03:27:27.769 --> 03:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
that we see prevailing in the global
 
03:27:30.349 --> 03:27:30.359 align:start position:0%
markets more expensive to operate
 
03:27:33.469 --> 03:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
we then also must rely on this forward
 
03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
capacity Market which is where those
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
Capital costs those upfront construction
 
03:27:38.720 --> 03:27:40.389 align:start position:0%
Capital costs those upfront construction
and

03:27:40.389 --> 03:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:43.370 --> 03:27:43.380 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance costs all must
 
03:27:44.690 --> 03:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
be recovered
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
but similarly I don't know that we only
 
03:27:50.630 --> 03:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
want to to rely on that and so we try
 
03:27:53.030 --> 03:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
and blend those those two elements
 
03:27:53.040 --> 03:27:54.290 align:start position:0%
and blend those those two elements
together

03:27:54.290 --> 03:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:27:54.300 --> 03:27:54.950 align:start position:0%
together
um

03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:59.150 --> 03:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully as as as I've been able to to
 
03:28:01.130 --> 03:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
try and weave in here and stayed at the
 
03:28:01.140 --> 03:28:02.090 align:start position:0%
try and weave in here and stayed at the
opening

03:28:02.090 --> 03:28:02.100 align:start position:0%
opening
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
um these markets are not perfect they
 
03:28:07.790 --> 03:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
probably never will be but that is what
 
03:28:10.070 --> 03:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve is that
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate balance all with then the
 
03:28:15.590 --> 03:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
ultimate eye on making sure that this
 
03:28:18.410 --> 03:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
blend of different financing and
 
03:28:20.650 --> 03:28:20.660 align:start position:0%
different operating characteristics
 
03:28:24.469 --> 03:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
provides a reliable and at least cost
 
03:28:27.769 --> 03:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
competitive service while trying to
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
achieve the the broader State policy
 
03:28:33.170 --> 03:28:33.180 align:start position:0%
mandates as they exist
 
03:28:37.370 --> 03:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you okay before I call on
 
03:28:39.410 --> 03:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative munz I have a couple of
 
03:28:41.330 --> 03:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions myself
 
03:28:44.330 --> 03:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
you expressed some concern earlier about
 
03:28:49.849 --> 03:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that ISO New England
 
03:28:56.870 --> 03:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
is the organization that oversees the
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
Planning and Building of transmission
 
03:29:01.849 --> 03:29:01.859 align:start position:0%
it's not the individual states or or the
 
03:29:04.250 --> 03:29:04.260 align:start position:0%
individual utilities that own that
 
03:29:04.260 --> 03:29:05.630 align:start position:0%
individual utilities that own that
transmission

03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
03:29:08.269 --> 03:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
system so
 
03:29:10.250 --> 03:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
is it your
 
03:29:13.190 --> 03:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
concern that ISO New England is over
 
03:29:14.929 --> 03:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
building our regional transmission
 
03:29:18.170 --> 03:29:18.180 align:start position:0%
system so to be clear ISO New England is
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for the planning of the
 
03:29:22.490 --> 03:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
transmission system and then it is the
 
03:29:24.650 --> 03:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
individual utilities who are designated
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
to do the building and put forward the
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
plans to implement some of those broader
 
03:29:34.190 --> 03:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
directives from the iso and yes I
 
03:29:36.050 --> 03:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
believe that the iso has both over
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
planned the transmission system and I am
 
03:29:39.950 --> 03:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
concerned that the utilities in
 
03:29:41.630 --> 03:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
implementing on both the Wholesale
 
03:29:43.309 --> 03:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
Transmission so the big transmission
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
lines on 93 that you see going down the
 
03:29:47.990 --> 03:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
highways as well as the more State
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
regulated distribution Network system
 
03:29:53.870 --> 03:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
deserve closer oversight
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you my second question earlier
 
03:29:59.389 --> 03:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
today when ISO New England was here we
 
03:30:03.410 --> 03:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
heard about the interconnection queue
 
03:30:05.450 --> 03:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
and the interconnection queue apparently
 
03:30:07.969 --> 03:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
at the moment is populated almost
 
03:30:11.269 --> 03:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
entirely with wind resources and solar
 
03:30:13.849 --> 03:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
resources there's virtually no
 
03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
gas nuclear
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
or any other type of resource in the
 
03:30:21.769 --> 03:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
interconnection queue
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
do you see that as a problem going
 
03:30:27.889 --> 03:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
forward will the resources that are in
 
03:30:30.830 --> 03:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
that queue be sufficient to provide the
 
03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
region with the
 
03:30:34.849 --> 03:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
double the amount of power that it needs
 
03:30:34.859 --> 03:30:39.170 align:start position:0%
double the amount of power that it needs
today

03:30:39.170 --> 03:30:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:42.050 --> 03:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that the iso interconnection
 
03:30:44.269 --> 03:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
queue is a really helpful snapshot into
 
03:30:46.849 --> 03:30:46.859 align:start position:0%
one version of what the future may look
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
like in that only a fraction of the
 
03:30:51.769 --> 03:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
resources that are in the queue at any
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
given moment and that's true today just
 
03:30:56.269 --> 03:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
as it was 20 years ago will ever
 
03:30:59.410 --> 03:30:59.420 align:start position:0%
actually get built it and so today
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
clearly the signal for where New England
 
03:31:07.010 --> 03:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
is is an exponential growth in some of
 
03:31:08.690 --> 03:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
those resources that you highlighted the
 
03:31:10.370 --> 03:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
one other segment that I see in a really
 
03:31:11.929 --> 03:31:11.939 align:start position:0%
large scale on the Queue are battery
 
03:31:14.510 --> 03:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
storage resources trying to enter the
 
03:31:14.520 --> 03:31:15.670 align:start position:0%
storage resources trying to enter the
market

03:31:15.670 --> 03:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
market
 
03:31:18.889 --> 03:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
whether that's sufficient to to meet our
 
03:31:22.250 --> 03:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
future needs I have no idea and yet what
 
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is figure out how do
 
03:31:27.650 --> 03:31:27.660 align:start position:0%
we preserve and maximize the existing
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that we do have match it
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
with the new resources that may be
 
03:31:34.729 --> 03:31:34.739 align:start position:0%
coming on into the market and cobbled
 
03:31:37.010 --> 03:31:37.020 align:start position:0%
together from there a combination that
 
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
is sufficient to meet our our future
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
demand needs and certainly one of the
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
biggest challenges that we face over the
 
03:31:48.410 --> 03:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
next decade decade plus is as we start
 
03:31:50.690 --> 03:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
to see an acceleration in growth in
 
03:31:50.700 --> 03:31:52.670 align:start position:0%
to see an acceleration in growth in
electrification

03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
electrification
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
to transportation to home heating a
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
growth that I do believe will occur
 
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
a challenge for New England is it's
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
really hard to cite anything here
 
03:32:03.479 --> 03:32:04.670 align:start position:0%
really hard to cite anything here
um

03:32:04.670 --> 03:32:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:07.570 --> 03:32:07.580 align:start position:0%
renewable conventional anything
 
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and we're going to have to
 
03:32:13.490 --> 03:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
reconcile the
 
03:32:16.610 --> 03:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
um the the long history and culture that
 
03:32:19.010 --> 03:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
we have in this region of local control
 
03:32:22.309 --> 03:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
over those processes with a regional
 
03:32:24.530 --> 03:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
Marketplace and Regional needs for
 
03:32:27.530 --> 03:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative munz has
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman and
 
03:32:34.370 --> 03:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's a great segue to my question
 
03:32:37.610 --> 03:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
um it has been suggested that um New
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to address some of these
 
03:32:41.809 --> 03:32:41.819 align:start position:0%
challenges should
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
um decouple from ISO and go our own way
 
03:32:47.330 --> 03:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
your thoughts
 
03:32:49.370 --> 03:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
so to be really corny for a minute I
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
think we're the United States for a
 
03:32:52.610 --> 03:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
reason and not the independent states
 
03:32:54.650 --> 03:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
for a reason we work much better
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
together and just as New Hampshire
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
should not be expected to be
 
03:33:00.469 --> 03:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in oranges I do not
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
believe it makes sense for us to be
 
03:33:04.190 --> 03:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in any individual
 
03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:08.349 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient in any individual
commodity

03:33:08.349 --> 03:33:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
03:33:13.010 --> 03:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh just a quick
 
03:33:14.630 --> 03:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
question you talked about earlier about
 
03:33:17.330 --> 03:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh individual State policies with
 
03:33:19.790 --> 03:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts number one policy if I
 
03:33:21.290 --> 03:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
understand right is uh in
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
decarbonization has uh the
 
03:33:26.210 --> 03:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
decarbonization policy of Massachusetts
 
03:33:28.490 --> 03:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
and because we're all members of iso New
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
England has it had any effect plant
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
closures lack of or changing of policy
 
03:33:37.429 --> 03:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
power capability affected the pricing or
 
03:33:40.610 --> 03:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
availability of power in New Hampshire
 
03:33:40.620 --> 03:33:42.110 align:start position:0%
availability of power in New Hampshire
foreign

03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:33:46.130 --> 03:33:46.140 align:start position:0%
I do believe that Massachusetts through
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
some of their state policies have had a
 
03:33:51.170 --> 03:33:51.180 align:start position:0%
price impact on on the regional
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
electricity Market uh and in it's
 
03:33:57.229 --> 03:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to pinpoint a plant closure on
 
03:33:59.450 --> 03:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
any individual policy and and I would
 
03:34:02.450 --> 03:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
hesitate to to do that but there is one
 
03:34:04.190 --> 03:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
policy in particular as I look at it
 
03:34:05.870 --> 03:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
which is that
 
03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
um Massachusetts more than any other
 
03:34:11.570 --> 03:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
state at least in in New England has a
 
03:34:13.729 --> 03:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
separate carbon price above and beyond
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
of which all New England states
 
03:34:21.349 --> 03:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
participate in that price is paid only
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
by carbon emitting power plants in
 
03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:25.750 align:start position:0%
by carbon emitting power plants in
Massachusetts

03:34:25.750 --> 03:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
03:34:28.729 --> 03:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
that by its very nature will increase
 
03:34:31.370 --> 03:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
the priced offers that those facilities
 
03:34:35.030 --> 03:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
make into to the market and when those
 
03:34:38.030 --> 03:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
plants are the the last facilities
 
03:34:41.150 --> 03:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
needed to meet reliability yes that
 
03:34:44.150 --> 03:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
means it creates a higher price for New
 
03:34:46.670 --> 03:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and all the other states in
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the region
 
03:34:50.750 --> 03:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to fully segregate the
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
impacts of an individual state
 
03:35:01.550 --> 03:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
in the regional market overall
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a
 
03:35:14.090 --> 03:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman following on to
 
03:35:17.520 --> 03:35:18.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman following on to
that

03:35:18.490 --> 03:35:18.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:35:23.690 --> 03:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
response we were in the previous uh ISO
 
03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
New England's presentation
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
they showed us that
 
03:35:31.370 --> 03:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and distributed energy
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
resources have had a significant
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
downward effect on demand and therefore
 
03:35:39.769 --> 03:35:39.779 align:start position:0%
price throughout the region
 
03:35:39.779 --> 03:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
price throughout the region
um

03:35:40.550 --> 03:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:43.370 --> 03:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
would you say that New Hampshire's
 
03:35:45.530 --> 03:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
relative lack of
 
03:35:48.290 --> 03:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
contribution of Energy Efficiency and
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources have had an
 
03:35:54.349 --> 03:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
upward effect on price
 
03:35:54.359 --> 03:35:56.809 align:start position:0%
upward effect on price
foreign

03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
that is a difficult counter factual for
 
03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
me to answer so let me try it this way
 
03:36:02.160 --> 03:36:03.769 align:start position:0%
me to answer so let me try it this way
uh

03:36:03.769 --> 03:36:03.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:07.090 --> 03:36:07.100 align:start position:0%
I agree that
 
03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts's policies on on Energy
 
03:36:13.309 --> 03:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency have had a net impact of
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
lowering the amount of of resources that
 
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
are bought through the capacity markets
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
and have therefore had a a depressing
 
03:36:24.889 --> 03:36:24.899 align:start position:0%
impact on the overall prices there
 
03:36:27.889 --> 03:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
to the degree that any other state does
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
not have as aggressive Energy Efficiency
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
policies in place by its nature they're
 
03:36:37.929 --> 03:36:37.939 align:start position:0%
going to be taking on a larger portion
 
03:36:42.349 --> 03:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
of the uh the demand in the region than
 
03:36:45.849 --> 03:36:45.859 align:start position:0%
they otherwise would and
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
bear the the costs associated with that
 
03:36:50.399 --> 03:36:52.429 align:start position:0%
bear the the costs associated with that
right

03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas Doug
 
03:36:56.870 --> 03:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for this
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
question uh do you handle any of our
 
03:37:04.790 --> 03:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
hydro plants in the state yes the vast
 
03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
majority of the hydro generation is
 
03:37:09.170 --> 03:37:09.180 align:start position:0%
within our membership yes well
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
follow up uh good thank you so can you
 
03:37:15.050 --> 03:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
um expand a little bit about their their
 
03:37:17.809 --> 03:37:17.819 align:start position:0%
contribution and their future uh in this
 
03:37:20.630 --> 03:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
state and and if they uh because I I
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
feel that they're important I'd like to
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
know what your thoughts are on their
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
longevity and continuity here I I
 
03:37:29.090 --> 03:37:29.100 align:start position:0%
believe that hydropower has a critical
 
03:37:31.250 --> 03:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
role to to play in this market both
 
03:37:33.590 --> 03:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
today and and frankly probably more so
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
into the future as we look at a future
 
03:37:39.410 --> 03:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
Market structure that requires
 
03:37:39.420 --> 03:37:40.630 align:start position:0%
Market structure that requires
flexibility

03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:37:43.269 --> 03:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
requires an ability to deliver
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
irrespective of
 
03:37:49.969 --> 03:37:49.979 align:start position:0%
um uh most weather and uh has an ability
 
03:37:52.670 --> 03:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
to perform over long periods of time
 
03:37:57.130 --> 03:37:57.140 align:start position:0%
Beyond just any one day cycle or one day
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
event I I think Hydro particularly
 
03:38:04.130 --> 03:38:04.140 align:start position:0%
larger hydro and aggregation of a number
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
of smaller Hydra facilities uh is is
 
03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
going to be a critical resource for the
 
03:38:08.580 --> 03:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
going to be a critical resource for the
region

03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:12.720 --> 03:38:14.330 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

03:38:14.330 --> 03:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:38:17.330 --> 03:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so so my other question was
 
03:38:19.190 --> 03:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
what's their
 
03:38:22.490 --> 03:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
prognosis for for progressing here and
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.090 --> 03:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
so I I think part of the challenge is
 
03:38:31.610 --> 03:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of the hydro
 
03:38:33.710 --> 03:38:33.720 align:start position:0%
electric generation not just in New
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but but across New England
 
03:38:39.050 --> 03:38:39.060 align:start position:0%
um does not receive some of the the
 
03:38:40.330 --> 03:38:40.340 align:start position:0%
other direct
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
Contracting and subsidies that we do see
 
03:38:45.309 --> 03:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
in other states and like other
 
03:38:48.050 --> 03:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
facilities that that do not have that
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
that benefit their economics suffer
 
03:38:54.650 --> 03:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
um in the market as a result and so I
 
03:38:57.229 --> 03:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
think in the long-term preservation of
 
03:38:58.729 --> 03:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
those facilities and making sure that
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
not only can we keep them as they are
 
03:39:03.469 --> 03:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
today but do the necessary reinvestment
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
in the facilities to maintain their
 
03:39:07.790 --> 03:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
operations that means turning changing
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
out the turbines
 
03:39:11.769 --> 03:39:11.779 align:start position:0%
um uh every 20 years or so
 
03:39:14.570 --> 03:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
particularly for hydro you get erosion
 
03:39:17.330 --> 03:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
in in the dams by its nature with with
 
03:39:20.269 --> 03:39:20.279 align:start position:0%
water having to to reinvest in that I
 
03:39:23.570 --> 03:39:23.580 align:start position:0%
think it's critical that we ensure that
 
03:39:25.849 --> 03:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
there is economic pricing coming out of
 
03:39:29.510 --> 03:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
that and feel fill this hole of how do
 
03:39:32.330 --> 03:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
we blend this bifurcated Market we have
 
03:39:32.340 --> 03:39:34.150 align:start position:0%
we blend this bifurcated Market we have
of

03:39:34.150 --> 03:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue guarantees for some
 
03:39:40.250 --> 03:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
and pure Live and Die in the market for
 
03:39:42.349 --> 03:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
others we have to find a way to bridge
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that Gap and I believe in doing so Hydro
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
along with frankly nuclear and some of
 
03:39:50.750 --> 03:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
the other resources that provide
 
03:39:53.530 --> 03:39:53.540 align:start position:0%
critical resources
 
03:39:56.210 --> 03:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are going to be most
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.570 --> 03:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
representative merner has a question
 
03:40:04.370 --> 03:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
hi nice to see you I had a long summer
 
03:40:05.590 --> 03:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
with you
 
03:40:08.210 --> 03:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh in August that was a record sale
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
obviously for the billions that was just
 
03:40:11.990 --> 03:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
sold on the Connecticut River for all
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
the hydros so obviously they don't a lot
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
more than we know what uh Quebec just
 
03:40:19.969 --> 03:40:19.979 align:start position:0%
paid for those hydros that came out to I
 
03:40:22.130 --> 03:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
think 500 and somewhat dollars per
 
03:40:22.140 --> 03:40:24.889 align:start position:0%
think 500 and somewhat dollars per
megawatt

03:40:24.889 --> 03:40:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:26.990 --> 03:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
so and it's good to see you
 
03:40:28.790 --> 03:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative uh uh uh what
 
03:40:30.410 --> 03:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
representative merner is referring to is
 
03:40:33.229 --> 03:40:33.239 align:start position:0%
that um a portfolio of hydro facilities
 
03:40:35.450 --> 03:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
called Great River Hydro
 
03:40:37.490 --> 03:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
um uh announced that it was being bought
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
by Hydro Quebec
 
03:40:44.090 --> 03:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
um uh for a a significant sum as as part
 
03:40:46.670 --> 03:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
of that I think there's a couple things
 
03:40:48.410 --> 03:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
um one is that um uh hydroquobec has
 
03:40:53.040 --> 03:40:53.690 align:start position:0%
um one is that um uh hydroquobec has
um

03:40:53.690 --> 03:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:56.330 --> 03:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
to put it politely I I had an
 
03:40:58.610 --> 03:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
interesting time of it in New England
 
03:40:59.929 --> 03:40:59.939 align:start position:0%
um over the last decade or so
 
03:41:02.389 --> 03:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
particularly in New Hampshire and I'm
 
03:41:04.370 --> 03:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
just going to leave that one there uh
 
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
and uh on top of that as as
 
03:41:11.210 --> 03:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
um I I was trying to um uh to emphasize
 
03:41:13.490 --> 03:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
in response to representative Thomas's
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
um question I think hydrogeneration is
 
03:41:17.570 --> 03:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
very well positioned
 
03:41:19.790 --> 03:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
um uh in the future of of this market
 
03:41:22.070 --> 03:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
and I think when you look at the
 
03:41:25.370 --> 03:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
combination of those two elements and
 
03:41:29.030 --> 03:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
the premium to come into this Market at
 
03:41:29.040 --> 03:41:29.929 align:start position:0%
the premium to come into this Market at
scale

03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
scale
 
03:41:32.990 --> 03:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
I I think that's where you see
 
03:41:35.630 --> 03:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
um a transaction price like that um
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
start to come out
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
um but yes it I certainly uh recognize
 
03:41:44.450 --> 03:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
the uh the wide eyes that that many had
 
03:41:48.889 --> 03:41:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:51.229 --> 03:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
yeah the the evaluation of facilities
 
03:41:53.809 --> 03:41:53.819 align:start position:0%
the the timing was was uh was ironic on
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
that one
 
03:41:57.170 --> 03:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question
 
03:41:59.690 --> 03:41:59.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:41:59.700 --> 03:42:01.010 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman and thank you
um

03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:03.410 --> 03:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
can you give us some estimate for how
 
03:42:05.929 --> 03:42:05.939 align:start position:0%
many Hydro properties in New Hampshire
 
03:42:09.769 --> 03:42:09.779 align:start position:0%
are unexploited because my observation
 
03:42:11.570 --> 03:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
is that there's a big pile of bricks
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
next to almost any good one I you know
 
03:42:15.229 --> 03:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
they have tens of megawatts that we
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
could still exploit hundreds of
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
megawatts or
 
03:42:22.610 --> 03:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
I hesitate to give you any direct answer
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
on that one because I I truly don't have
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
um a a good enough understanding of what
 
03:42:35.450 --> 03:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
that that could look like
 
03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:36.110 align:start position:0%
that that could look like
um

03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:40.490 --> 03:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
I know you know new Hydro is really hard
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
to to permit and cite it's a years-long
 
03:42:47.650 --> 03:42:47.660 align:start position:0%
process even to re-license facilities
 
03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
and each of these Hydro facilities have
 
03:42:53.929 --> 03:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
a finite operating license
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
is a years-long process working with the
 
03:42:59.630 --> 03:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
host communities and overseen by the
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
 
03:43:06.410 --> 03:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
to develop in any meaningful large-scale
 
03:43:10.849 --> 03:43:10.859 align:start position:0%
new facilities or bring back into the
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
market facilities that may have shut
 
03:43:12.600 --> 03:43:14.269 align:start position:0%
market facilities that may have shut
down

03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to say never but I think
 
03:43:21.650 --> 03:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.650 --> 03:43:24.660 align:start position:0%
well we don't want to uh to keep you
 
03:43:28.210 --> 03:43:28.220 align:start position:0%
folks any longer I know you uh both have
 
03:43:30.889 --> 03:43:30.899 align:start position:0%
lots of other activities that you need
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
to engage in so we want to thank you
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
profusely for being here for providing
 
03:43:37.190 --> 03:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
some great information
 
03:43:39.769 --> 03:43:39.779 align:start position:0%
and for visiting with us it's great to
 
03:43:42.349 --> 03:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
see you both and I'm sure we'll see you
 
03:43:44.269 --> 03:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
again in the not too distant future so
 
03:43:47.510 --> 03:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much
 
03:43:51.410 --> 03:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
and with that we come to the end of our
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
committee activity for today I would
 
03:43:56.750 --> 03:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
remind all members to consult the
 
03:43:59.090 --> 03:43:59.100 align:start position:0%
calendar that will be published this
 
03:44:02.630 --> 03:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
evening for the schedule for Monday and
 
03:44:05.210 --> 03:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
Tuesday of this coming week
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
to go over it quickly with you I'll
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
remind you that we have on Monday
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
morning a presentation by the puc from 9
 
03:44:19.490 --> 03:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
we'll finish up some of the committee
 
03:44:23.990 --> 03:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
business that we didn't complete on
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
organization day
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi will explain the
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
process of executive session during that
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
half hour period
 
03:44:36.530 --> 03:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
and then after lunch we start hearing
 
03:44:40.070 --> 03:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
bills so we will hear four bills
 
03:44:42.769 --> 03:44:42.779 align:start position:0%
on the afternoon of Monday
 
03:44:45.050 --> 03:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
and then on Tuesday we come back at nine
 
03:44:47.870 --> 03:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
o'clock and we have a presentation by

the community Power Association or
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
Community power Coalition of New
 
03:44:56.330 --> 03:44:56.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from nine to nine from nine to
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
ten thirty and then we will hear bills
 
03:45:04.610 --> 03:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 1 2 and 3 o'clock
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
and then at four o'clock we will have an
 
03:45:09.410 --> 03:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
executive session our first executive
 
03:45:11.809 --> 03:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
session of the year
 
03:45:15.889 --> 03:45:15.899 align:start position:0%
we have five early bills and we will be
 
03:45:18.290 --> 03:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
hearing three of those on Monday and
