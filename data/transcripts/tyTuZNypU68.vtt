00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
no amount of work over the summer is
 
00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
going to fix it so i don't see any
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
reason to retain it
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
it should be itl thank you
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative i agree with
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
everything that representative smith
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
just said it serves no purpose to retain
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:05.839 align:start position:0%
um it's unworkable
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
um and the objections that were raised
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
or the reasoning that was raised for itl
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the previous bill applies uh equally
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
well here as well
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
conversation regarding three two five
 
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
conversation regarding three two five
um

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
my only comment on uh house bill 325 is
 
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.110 align:start position:0%
my only comment on uh house bill 325 is
uh

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
probably you're correct that it's
 
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:38.870 align:start position:0%
probably you're correct that it's
superfluous

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
superfluous
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
but it also means uh there's no
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
there's no factual difference between
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
killing it now or
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
killing it in november if that's the
 
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.350 align:start position:0%
killing it in november if that's the
case

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i think any of these uh that may be
 
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.150 align:start position:0%
and i think any of these uh that may be
retained

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
are going to be retained for the purpose
 
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
as you call it insurance
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
while we've talked about the bill that
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
came out of the other
 
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's no way of knowing uh how that
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
will proceed through the
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the process and it
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
may be that
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
something uh can be uh
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
can be salvaged or changed or moved and
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
having a bill to do that i think it
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
is worthwhile i saw a representative
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh no lay's hand come back up yep
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative blade well thank you mr
 
00:18:36.789 --> 00:18:36.799 align:start position:0%
chair yeah i'm
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
i mean i i hear what you're saying but
 
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.950 align:start position:0%
i mean i i hear what you're saying but
um

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
again there's no need to retain the bill
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
if if the other bill or other approaches
 
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.230 align:start position:0%
if if the other bill or other approaches
fail

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
fail
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
um nothing really would prevent the
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh a representative from resubmitting
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
um and if the uh bill
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
is deemed not to be repetitive or
 
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
is deemed not to be repetitive or
directly

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
directly
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
uh a repeat of the bill that was
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
defeated this session if such had
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
happened that decision is made by a
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
member of this committee i.e the speaker
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't really see why you need to
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
retain this at all
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
but you know that's that's your choice
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
so understood
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit different than some
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
of the others that we're talking about
 
00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
state of emergency this deals with the
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
emergency orders
 
00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:57.039 align:start position:0%
and it may be very helpful to any
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee that is going to be looking at
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
these bills at a later time
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
to include the executive order and
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
be um something that should be put in
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
versus the state of emergency so
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think that this needs to be retained
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
in current resolution two yes
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
ah representative smith uh thank you mr
 
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.430 align:start position:0%
ah representative smith uh thank you mr
chairman

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
um hcr 2 is clear
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
it is well written it does not possess
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
any structural flaws working on this
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
over the summer is not going to produce
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
any meaningful change on the bill
 
00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of a motion to
 
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.389 align:start position:0%
that is the purpose of a motion to
retain

00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
retain
 
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
so there really is no reason to do so
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
with this time
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um if there were other purposes for a
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
motion to retain
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
um you know those might be accomplished
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
by doing so at this time but
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that we should be
 
00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:38.870 align:start position:0%
it would seem to me that we should be
seeking

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
uh the accountability that goes with
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of activists
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
out in the public who have an immediate
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
interest in the outcome
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the house's action on this and
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
postponing that would seem to be a
 
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.310 align:start position:0%
postponing that would seem to be a
disservice

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
disservice
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
to all of the people who've testified
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
and contacted us by email and phone etc
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
asking us to you know move forward or
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
not with this bill so retaining it
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
at this time really doesn't serve
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
a legislative purpose or the public
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
purpose so i would urge the committee to
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can make a regular
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you are there any other
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
comments from uh
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
could you comment later i'm in a zoom
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
meeting with the committee and we're
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
um the only comment that i will make is
 
00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:56.929 align:start position:0%
uh i sent you to the
 
00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.870 align:start position:0%
uh i sent you to the
[Applause]

00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
to the letter that was sent to the
 
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.470 align:start position:0%
to the letter that was sent to the
committee

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
from our house clerk
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
and in that letter
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
um there were a number of
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
comments made regarding uh
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriateness of um or or the
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.390 align:start position:0%
the appropriateness of um or or the
actions

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
of house hdr2
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
and whether it would accomplish the uh
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
the intention of the sponsors um
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
i think there are things that we could
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
work on um
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
with hdr2 and for that reason i will be
 
00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
with hdr2 and for that reason i will be
voting

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
voting
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
in favor of retaining hcr2
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh any other comments if not i will ask
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%

no representative hill yes
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
he said having
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh the vote of eight to seven house
 
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
current resolution two is representing
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
i think that covers us all is another
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
that means i will close the executive
 
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
that means i will close the executive
session

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
um i do have questions for the
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee about the upcoming session
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
on the 7th 8th and 9th looking through
 
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.510 align:start position:0%
on the 7th 8th and 9th looking through
the

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
list of work that is going to be brought
 
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:10.710 align:start position:0%
list of work that is going to be brought
up

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
on those dates i was wondering if
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
we anticipate uh floor debates
 
00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
i would be grateful if we would take the
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
bills we voted
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
in opposition to or where we didn't
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
agree today as well as
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
um bills that we handled in our last
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
executive session there were two bills
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
at that time h bill 156
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
which was an eight to seven vote and um
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
age bill 558 which was in each seven
 
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.030 align:start position:0%
age bill 558 which was in each seven
bill

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
hbill 156 was inexpedient to the
 
00:38:00.069 --> 00:38:00.079 align:start position:0%
legislate and it was relative
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
to posting legislative amendments on the
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire legislative
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
website h bill hb
 
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
558 was retained eight to seven
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
and that established the use of
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process so i'm
 
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.150 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process so i'm
wondering

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
are people expecting to fight on either
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
of those two
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
on the dates that they come into session
 
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.430 align:start position:0%
on the dates that they come into session
so

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
um i would say that house bill 558 will
 
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
um i would say that house bill 558 will
not

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
is probably the best
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity although i also see cacr5
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
that was a nine to six vote
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
so those i think it's those two cacr5
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
and host bill 156 that
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible for you to get
 
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:07.750 align:start position:0%
um would it be possible for you to get
together

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
with your caucus and let me know by by
 
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
with your caucus and let me know by by
wednesday

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
wednesday
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
i think it'll be helpful since we're all
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
here right now as the committee of the
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
whole since it's a small committee
 
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
um if we could quickly review those and
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
figure out if someone wants to speak
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
to those or any of the ones we disagreed
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
um we would
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
we would not be speaking on it
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
unless there is a intention of
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
the minority debt to who can speak on it
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
so so i'm asking
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
their bills that we don't agree with
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
the republicans on on the opposition on
 
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:49.829 align:start position:0%
the republicans on on the opposition on
on

00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
any of the bills today or the previous
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
ones mentioned
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
on h3156 or cacr5
 
00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
is anyone from our side planning to
 
00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:00.550 align:start position:0%
is anyone from our side planning to
speak

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:05.599 align:start position:0%

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%

great so it's just really those two i
 
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.069 align:start position:0%
great so it's just really those two i
think

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
unless anyone can think of others uh
 
00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
unless anyone can think of others uh
cacr5

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
cacr5
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
and house bill 156 yep okay
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
seeing seeing no other
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
um that hand that was what you were
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to remind me about
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
right so i don't think that unless you
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
want anything else
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
plus the ones today well there's nothing
 
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.109 align:start position:0%
plus the ones today well there's nothing
today

00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes people have thought we take
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
retention on the floor
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
are any of our members planning to have
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
any floor debates on any of the bills we
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
um i'll say that if there's a floor vote
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
on the motion to retain uh the bills we
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
retained today i'll speak against them
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
right yeah my understanding is that
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no floor vote on that
 
00:41:39.839 --> 00:41:40.390 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no floor vote on that
but

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
if it came up i would volunteer okay
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
