00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
welcome everybody seeing that it is um
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
903 I am going to open the subcommittee
 
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
work session on House Bill 1111 referred
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
for interim study and uh with that I am
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
going to speak to my fellow subcommittee
 
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
members we have a guest who is a member
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
of the ENA representative Davis who is
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
here to um
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely contribute in any way but as
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
far as a voting
 
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
um Mr Davis doesn't have a vote on the
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but welcome again and uh
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
with that I'd like to just let folks
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
take a minute to look at the proposed
 
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.629 align:start position:0%
take a minute to look at the proposed
um

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
subcommittee report that we are looking
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
at and obviously we as a a subcommittee
 
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
with the work session will present a
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
um recommendation to the full full
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
Committee of the house environment and
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and so we are just going to
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
go through this for a minute it'll be
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
very informal and we'll make any changes
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
and suggestions uh cooperatively
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
together and then hopefully we'll get to
 
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
a place since we do have a quorum
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
established where we can make a
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
recommendation out
 
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
so with that I'll just give us a few
 
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:33.060 align:start position:0%
um sure representative Bixby did you
 
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:55.129 align:start position:0%
um sure representative Bixby did you
wanna

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative contract uh
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby um this work
 
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:01.620 align:start position:0%
session is either to recommend this for
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not recommend is
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
is the choice here
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
um it's it's different than a study
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
so to answer the question yes and we can
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
certainly go through them today too if
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
there are typographical or minor changes
 
00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:27.419 align:start position:0%
that you would like to suggest uh happy
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
to do that and um we can if there are
 
00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
small sort of scriveners type things
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
sorry you'll note that the footnotes uh
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
you each have an electronic draft uh as
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
well the footnote you can click on and
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
they will take you directly to that site
 
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative homela yes thank you uh
 
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
the question I I did have so this is
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
this document is is intended to capture
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
maybe our discussion on this okay
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
because right now it's reads like a an
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
informational document on the topic
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct and you'll add to that
 
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's correct because we haven't made a
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation yet so I didn't I left
 
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
that sort of bolded area open because we
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had that discussion yet today to
 
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation forward thank you
 
00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.769 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation forward thank you
okay

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
we have General representative Stapleton
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you
 
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:08.820 align:start position:0%
um looking at the original Bill and um
 
00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:11.519 align:start position:0%
its focus is on establishing a
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
commission to study
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility so
 
00:10:20.269 --> 00:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
um we're here today to
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
focus on that and move along on that but
 
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.110 align:start position:0%
focus on that and move along on that but
maybe

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
Rectify some of the language if there's
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
a problem and any extent on that that's
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
a great question um so we heard various
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
levels of testimony last week and there
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
were different stakeholders just to
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
review for those of us who weren't sorry
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
no go ahead
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
um those of us who were not here who
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
submitted uh remarks regarding issues
 
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
that are still currently for
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
consideration among various stakeholders
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
whether it was Municipal associations or
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
itself had some comments that they made
 
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
itself had some comments that they made
regarding

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
um sort of the general overall sentiment
 
00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:03.779 align:start position:0%
of extended producer responsibility so
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes the only two outcomes for this
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can be to recommend it for
 
00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
future legislation or not and that could
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
be in various
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
um forms there was a discussion last
 
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:19.380 align:start position:0%
week on whether or not sub uh a
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission would be the
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
most prudent method forward so we could
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
have that discussion uh for
 
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the Full House Ena
 
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
committee or something else
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah I just wanted
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
to sort of sort of do a sort of
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
parliamentary clarification so uh the
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
the bill as it came to us this current
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
term is essentially not it is no longer
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
active because because it's in what
 
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
interim study is it makes the bill
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
inactive but it the question is whether
 
00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
the I some of the ideas from the bill
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
should be going forward so what our
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be focused on is
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
what should future legislation look like
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to should be we be doing
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
anything with that that previous bill as
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
does that clarify okay great so so with
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
that this is really just the background
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
knowledge of kind of what we're looking
 
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
at overall and where we were and and
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
like I said uh the last hearing we did
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
hear from municipalities who were
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
sharing with us that tipping fees are
 
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.970 align:start position:0%
sharing with us that tipping fees are
still

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:34.200 align:start position:0%
um increasing I think it was generally
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
72 dollars a ton to an increase around a
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
hundred and twelve dollars
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
so uh Wasteland is growing 72.10 20 21
 
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:45.260 align:start position:0%
82 a ton
 
00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
uh in 2022 and that just keeps on a
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a ton in 2025. that was
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
the anticipated sort of increase in uh
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
tipping fees
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and then uh Des did also comment
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
about and it is also cited sort of in
 
00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
the draft report that they have a desire
 
00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
to see extended producer responsibility
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be a component to how they are
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
addressing the waste streams within
 
00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
their Solid Waste plan and that was a
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
strategy for legislative action 1.9
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
where it reads explore legislation
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
including extended producer
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility epr programs that would
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
require product Brands and manufacturers
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
to enhance the recyclability of their
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
products and packaging and minimize the
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
use of necessary materials in single
 
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
Des also said that they had just
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
produced their report they came out on
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
September 30th so uh something to look
 
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:46.490 align:start position:0%
September 30th so uh something to look
at

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
I have just for your reference
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
Representatives sent that along and it
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
is also a footnote attachment in this
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
report electronically which you also
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the draft the working
 
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.009 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the draft the working
draft

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:01.019 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um in the test
 
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
in testimony we heard uh it seemed like
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
the focus of the testimony in the
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
advocacy of the people who testified was
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
to do a commission
 
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
so that is not necessarily what our
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations are legislatively moving
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
forward that was whether we are through
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislation authorizing a a commission
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
is that correct as opposed to any other
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
type of extended producer legislation
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding your
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
um the conversation was around both the
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
commission and the committee as
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
potential options in the future uh to
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's Point HB 1111 was
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the vehicle for which uh the concept of
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility now
 
00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:55.019 align:start position:0%
sits before us as a subcommittee so now
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
we are looking through all of the things
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
that we heard last week as well as sort
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
of looking at this draft report and
 
00:15:04.129 --> 00:15:04.139 align:start position:0%
making a decision about what we feel
 
00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:04.850 align:start position:0%
making a decision about what we feel
um

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
to send essentially a recommendation to
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
the Future legislature
 
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
to look at what would happen next and
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
what we feel the sentiment is of the
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted for
 
00:15:26.329 --> 00:15:26.339 align:start position:0%
clarification just because I'm going to
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
be uh signing this document but it says
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill and what we're working on
 
00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
is establishing a commission to study
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility and
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
basically the motion in my mind is
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
either we're going to recommend the
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
commission or we're not
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and other
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
so I mean we can put down in our
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
comments that there should be future
 
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
legislation but what this committee is
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be working on and is my
 
00:15:55.569 --> 00:15:55.579 align:start position:0%
understanding is whether we're going to
 
00:15:58.610 --> 00:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
suggest a commission
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
uh according to this all right Bill
 
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.210 align:start position:0%
uh according to this all right Bill
title

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
title
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
you sure can thank you rep Comfort
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.009 --> 00:16:34.019 align:start position:0%
okay this still seems to be ambiguous to
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
me and I
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
um is there a way we well
 
00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.590 align:start position:0%
um is there a way we well
um

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
Christine Miss Grant Miss Grant uh is
 
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.370 align:start position:0%
Christine Miss Grant Miss Grant uh is
there

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
um do you happen to know about the
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
Parliamentary distinction in
 
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:50.220 align:start position:0%
distinctions here in terms of
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh when the what a vote for recommend
 
00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:56.579 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or not recommend
 
00:16:59.290 --> 00:16:59.300 align:start position:0%
for future legislation would imply about
 
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
whether it is
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
recommending the exact same bill or if
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's recommending uh you know the the
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
confirm my belief and let you know but
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
and it's technically you don't want this
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
repetition but if you want
 
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:45.780 align:start position:0%
me no that would be that would be
 
00:17:48.049 --> 00:17:48.059 align:start position:0%
fantastic in this Grant and uh in that
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
if that is possible then for us to make
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation and you can let us know
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
today uh while we're meeting
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay that's fantastic great thank you
 
00:17:59.150 --> 00:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
so but with that I would say that we
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
should still kind of go forward and work
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
on and think about what we would like um
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
as far as the content that's already
 
00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:09.299 align:start position:0%
here currently if folks are happy with
 
00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:11.039 align:start position:0%
the background knowledge
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
and what is existing here currently we
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
can look at that piece
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
um so I understand that you want to look
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
at this piece here which is very well
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
done by the way so thank you
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
um but it also the the bill itself that
 
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
we are have been tasked to look at is
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
very very specific also and what its
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
so um and when we had looked at it we
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
did discuss last week sort of the
 
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
presiding members the membership of the
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
commission that would be there uh
 
00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:53.220 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton do you have a
 
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
copy of the
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
um Bill itself as it was sent over yes
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
great okay and so we did discuss uh with
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative partial a little bit
 
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
representative partial a little bit
about

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
um producer stakeholders and where that
 
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.770 align:start position:0%
um producer stakeholders and where that
may

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
where they may fit into this as they
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
were not a named member but they uh
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
there was testimony last meeting that
 
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
those folks may still be called upon
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
should uh the commission as the bill is
 
00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.210 align:start position:0%
should uh the commission as the bill is
written

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
desire to have them testify before their
 
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:35.510 align:start position:0%
desire to have them testify before their
Commission

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
and obviously the content of the um
 
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
the one thing that does make me wonder a
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
little bit is the the date for the
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
legislation for September of 2022
 
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:52.580 align:start position:0%
has passed so the date is no longer
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
accurate as the bill sits so that's why
 
00:19:59.690 --> 00:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
um representative Bixby so uh typically
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh in the
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
the reporting date the the those the
 
00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:08.660 align:start position:0%
dates are are considered are not
 
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
considered binding when you're doing if
 
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
you're recommending future legislation
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the dates don't carry along with it uh
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
because uh it's it wouldn't be practical
 
00:20:18.419 --> 00:20:19.850 align:start position:0%
because uh it's it wouldn't be practical
right

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
so representative Pamela are we at the
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
point where we can discuss this could
 
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
like deliberate right we can I can is
 
00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
this the appropriate time oh go ahead
 
00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
let's let's wait what the committee
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
researcher has
 
00:20:32.880 --> 00:21:00.590 align:start position:0%
researcher has
yes

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Miss Grant so with
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
that clarification does the subcommittee
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
feel confident that we can continue to
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
have this discussion and
 
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:12.900 align:start position:0%
um kind of go forward how we feel uh
 
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.460 align:start position:0%
best as a committee and I know we work
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
so well together so
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
um I'll look to representative kongwa
 
00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
who has been very helpful in this so
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so I mean I see
 
00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
three options here
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
um going forward uh one we can recommend
 
00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
two we can recommend a study committee
 
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.250 align:start position:0%
two we can recommend a study committee
um

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
or three we cannot recommend anything at
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
all I think those are really the three
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
options that we sh uh
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
have in front of us regarding this based
 
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
on the testimony and everything that
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
we've heard last week and based on this
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:21:59.690 --> 00:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
um looking at the difference between a
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
study commission and a study committee a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
study committee is made up only of
 
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
legislators uh commission is made up of
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislators and other stakeholders and
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh one of the uh one of the arguments in
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
favor of a commission is that you have a
 
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
broader range of uh of stakeholders who
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
are actually at the table and it may
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
provide broader representation uh an
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
argument against a commission is that
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
the process of actually getting all
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
those stakeholders appointed by the
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
various people who are supposed to
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
appoint them can significantly delay the
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
uh the development of the study
 
00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:50.820 align:start position:0%
commission the the study and uh it is
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
you can it is entirely within the power
 
00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:58.020 align:start position:0%
of those stakeholders to attend every
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
session because it is a public hearing
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it is typically the practice of a
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
study committee to invite stakeholders
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
that they are aware of uh and uh and
 
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:12.980 align:start position:0%
it's specifically illicit test County
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
so just in terms of the smooth operation
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
there's I I have a preference towards a
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
study committee uh unless in in many in
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
there are there are some situations
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
where our study commission may be better
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
but in this particular situation I think
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
that in terms of getting the job done
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
efficiently uh a study committee would
 
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
be more effective okay thank you for
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
sharing that
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
for sharing that
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
Robert Bixby
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to look to representative
 
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
kongwa and then representative Stapleton
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
and then if representative homela has
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
thoughts we'll we'll do that as well
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'm going to
 
00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:53.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'm going to
Echo

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
Echo
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
um representative bixby's uh
 
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
insight into study committee committee
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
versus a commission I serve on both
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that in my personal
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
opinion a study committee can bring
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
everybody to the table it can take
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be done in one
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
meeting and we can enact and
 
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:21.620 align:start position:0%
promote legislation immediately a study
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
a commission
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
it takes years
 
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
literally and you're at the behest of
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
what the government is is asking for you
 
00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
have to get permission to do some of the
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
things that we need to do
 
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
um working on the commission that I'm on
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's very
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
um slow moving
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
and if you really want to be proactive I
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
think the study committee is the way to
 
00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.270 align:start position:0%
think the study committee is the way to
go

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:52.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative control I'm
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
going to look to representative
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you madam chair um
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
I think the study committee is a both
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
timely and flexible
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
and I think that's important when we
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
have so much legislation so much work to
 
00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
do and everybody's so busy we can be
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
more effective in an immediate basis
 
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
with a study a committee
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
and you know what one of the functions
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
of the study committee could be
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
ultimately if there's a great deal of
 
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
material and possibility that we
 
00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:25.860 align:start position:0%
recommend a study commission another
 
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
bill going down the road so we haven't
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
cut that possibility off
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
um I was looking back at 111 and and the
 
00:25:37.789 --> 00:25:37.799 align:start position:0%
Crux of it in in Roman 4 study the
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
commission study shall include but not
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
be limited to
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
uh examining the waste reduction goals
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
established in RSA 149 m
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
M and then B
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
um suggested legislation in order to
 
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
help update RSA 149 M to better meet the
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
waste reduction goals they're in you
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
know I think that focuses what we're all
 
00:26:03.649 --> 00:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
about and I would have to read 149 M to
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
see how far it goes and how short it it
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
comes to meeting a goal and I apologize
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
for the to the study committee because I
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
missed the last meeting I had automobile
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
problems and have not had a chance to
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
really back up the homework on this
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
stuff so um I'm still trying to get my
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
head around it but I think this
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
discussion helps about which way to go
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
forward and study committee sounds like
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
a reasonable step to me thank you you're
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
welcome thanks for that Insight I would
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
also like to say that I do believe that
 
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:35.330 align:start position:0%
also like to say that I do believe that
um

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
obviously we now have the solid waste
 
00:26:40.789 --> 00:26:40.799 align:start position:0%
um plan that has been issued on October
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
1st and we have that as a compendium to
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
the the information that we would
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
potentially be considering before either
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
a commission or a committee so I think
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
that having that knowledge and that
 
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:53.820 align:start position:0%
information alongside of it is helpful
 
00:26:57.289 --> 00:26:57.299 align:start position:0%
to addressing 149m which are our Solid
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
Waste sort of reduction
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's the vehicle for it through 149 M
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
so I would I would agree with you in
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
that statement and I would also say that
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
that report
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
um I think will be very helpful as well
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
as the work that we know is already
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
going on with the solid waste working
 
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
group that uh represented evil chairs
 
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
and had a discussion alongside of that
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:24.049 --> 00:27:24.059 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for a follow-up um two things
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
came to mind is there a deadline that we
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
have to deliver something on this study
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee that's a great question so yes
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
our recommendation needs to be ready to
 
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
go for next week to the Full House
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee as
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
we will be meeting in an executive
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
session to take up all of the interim
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
study bills before us and what date is
 
00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
that October 25th okay second question
 
00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
is there an existing commission that
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
touches upon this subject at a greater
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
or lesser extent
 
00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:03.059 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so to some
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
degree there may be some conversation
 
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
within the solid waste working group
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
although they are two we are two
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
separate and different entities they
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
um there was some testimony last week
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
that they may take that up
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
um but at this point at when they had
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
testified before us there was not a they
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
had not Dove deeply into that area so
 
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:27.500 align:start position:0%
representative uh control might have a
 
00:28:30.049 --> 00:28:30.059 align:start position:0%
recollection as well
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairs so according to
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
um representative Ebel she of the solo
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
waste working group she said the epr is
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
way up on the study list
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
um and then she mentioned something
 
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:47.340 align:start position:0%
about HB 1167 which she uh when she
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
chaired that committee but she said that
 
00:28:54.169 --> 00:28:54.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby oh sorry
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative Houma love first I had
 
00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
recognized her for let's start thank you
 
00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I just wanted to
 
00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:04.909 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I just wanted to
uh

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.380 align:start position:0%
to add to this that in the legislature
 
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
itself in the bill HB uh 111 it actually
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
lists both a committee and a commission
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
in the language just so you just so
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're aware of that and maybe that's
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
just a uh that's the way that OLS writes
 
00:29:24.049 --> 00:29:24.059 align:start position:0%
things I'm not really sure but it says
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
in there
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
establish a committee to study extender
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility in the next line
 
00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
in Roman 2 it says the members of the
 
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
commission shall
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
where are you seeing
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
so number line number one
 
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.430 align:start position:0%
so number line number one
um

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
and then Roman numeral two seems like it
 
00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:45.299 align:start position:0%
it includes both of those it looks like
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
that might be a scrivener's error but I
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
the we have the prime sponsor of the
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:57.769 --> 00:29:57.779 align:start position:0%
intend this to be a committee rather
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me I did write this bill as
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
commission I do believe that might have
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
been a typographical error however I
 
00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
should also add in light of the
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard most recently
 
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
I think a study uh committee would be a
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
fine way to proceed
 
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
uh that would seem to be the
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
recommendation of some of the people
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that testified
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
and so I don't see that as being off
 
00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.889 align:start position:0%
and so I don't see that as being off
Target

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:24.899 align:start position:0%
Target
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
follow up please you can follow up thank
 
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
you I just want to add this this third
 
00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
perspective on to this
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
um everyone in this room agrees that
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
reduction of material and landfills is a
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
good thing so we're not having a
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
discussion necessarily about whether it
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
is a valid Noble goal or not that's
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
already a given
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about obviously the
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
study committee versus commission but I
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
I would add to that that it seems with
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group and with
 
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.710 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group and with
the

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
that it's their one of their on their
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
Radars one of their priorities and
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
within des and the fact that 13 state
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
legislatures are already Reinventing
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
this wheel or in the process of ending
 
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
this will I would actually counter that
 
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
even having a study committee we already
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
have the mechanisms in which to look at
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
this and if the solid waste working
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
group feels like this is one of their
 
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:21.059 align:start position:0%
largest priorities then get at it so I I
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not trying to throw shade on
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
any of that I'm just trying to say that
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
sometimes we bury ourselves in process
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
and I think the best goal is to be as
 
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
Nimble as possible and
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
if the solid waste working group can't
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
get this at get at this as a as a
 
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.370 align:start position:0%
get this at get at this as a as a
reasonable

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.149 align:start position:0%
reasonable
um

00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
you know action item then there's no way
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
that our our agency structures are going
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
to be able to implement anything I mean
 
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820 align:start position:0%
we just we have to move forward as we
 
00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.590 align:start position:0%
we just we have to move forward as we
can

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so I would actually recommend that
 
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:55.740 align:start position:0%
we actually have the structures in place
 
00:31:58.690 --> 00:31:58.700 align:start position:0%
that could be looking at these and even
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
commission I think the it sounds like
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
from the room that a commission is maybe
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
not not something that might be
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
recommended this time but I would
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
actually sort of counter to that as well
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
that let's really look at whether
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee or not committee because I do
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
think that we have structures in place
 
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740 align:start position:0%
through Des through the solid waste
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
working group that these conversations
 
00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:21.299 align:start position:0%
can be had and and legislation can be
 
00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980 align:start position:0%
recommended thank you
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative
 
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:27.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby right so one of the
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that a study committee
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
can work is to uh very Focus very
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
narrowly on what is needed for for
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
legislation and uh and if the if the if
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
this committee starts with the
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
understanding that legislation is
 
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980 align:start position:0%
already you know or the assumption that
 
00:32:54.769 --> 00:32:54.779 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary and the
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
question is how do we craft that
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
legislation what needs to go into it
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
what do we need who do we need for
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders then a study committee is
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
actually a better tool for getting the
 
00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:08.419 align:start position:0%
specifics you need to put into the bill
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
than a broader work broader uh group
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
like the solid waste working group which
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
has the epr and it's as one of many
 
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
different uh priorities and we could
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
certain the study committee could
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
certainly work in constant in in concert
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
with uh the solid waste working group
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
but they would be able to uh delve more
 
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:34.740 align:start position:0%
deeply and more quickly into details
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
like uh how do we get the various
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders on board with a particular
 
00:33:45.409 --> 00:33:45.419 align:start position:0%
way of setting up the legislation so
 
00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:48.539 align:start position:0%
um I think that a a study committee
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
would be a more effective way of
 
00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
actually getting the legislation written
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to looking at whether the
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
question is important
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
I from what I I hear what you're saying
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
is that if it's the assumption that
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed or legislation
 
00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
needs to be moved forward but with
 
00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
regard to Extended producer
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities I'm not sure we fully
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
had that conversation of have we
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know does the house agree or not
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
agree that these costs should be passed
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
on to the manufacturers and is it their
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
responsibility we you know it's that
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
conversation that that cost will get
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
passed on to Consumers so I don't think
 
00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
that's necessarily fleshed out that it's
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
a foregone conclusion that it's our
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility at this time to
 
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that there it's not a
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
noble goal but we haven't I don't
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
believe fully had that conversation and
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm mistaken uh representative
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
Pamela if I may speak to that and then
 
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll look to you one of the
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
um pieces of information that I do have
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
here that I do want to make sure that we
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
recognize is some background knowledge
 
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.530 align:start position:0%
recognize is some background knowledge
on

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
um a report produced by The Ellen
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
MacArthur Foundation which looked at
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
over a hundred small medium and large
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
multinational industry uh Private
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
Industry stakeholders who signed onto
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
and they were very large from large
 
00:35:19.609 --> 00:35:19.619 align:start position:0%
companies like the Pepsi Coca-Cola folks
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
to all sorts of other Industries
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
including uh Walmart was a signatory who
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
is really um they are looking at similar
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
and initiatives around this in the
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
private sector but they are also looking
 
00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:34.250 align:start position:0%
private sector but they are also looking
to

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
um governments to help navigate some of
 
00:35:39.609 --> 00:35:39.619 align:start position:0%
the challenges that there are with
 
00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
needing to amend potentially some of the
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislative language to allow some of
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
these things to happen so in that in
 
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
that regard I do think to representative
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
bixby's point when we look at committee
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
versus commission the commission that we
 
00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
know that is before is with the solid
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
wage working group is already looking at
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
a million different things there's a
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
large sort of
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
umbrella whereas a committee might
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
afford US the opportunity to be able to
 
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
look at things very narrowly
 
00:36:14.089 --> 00:36:14.099 align:start position:0%
and when I chaired hb617
 
00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:16.260 align:start position:0%
um and that was under the chairmanship
 
00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
of representative O'Connor at that time
 
00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative evil and Senator Waters
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
and myself that was looking at Solid
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
Waste and Recycling and we could that
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
was the very beginning of all of this
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
discussion in that sense where we really
 
00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
dug our dug deep and had many meetings
 
00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
where we were able to invite different
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to the table to give
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
testimony about a very very narrow areas
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
and I I imagine that we might be able to
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
achieve that with a recommendation of
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
that nature regarding just extended
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility I'm open to
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
hearing other thoughts
 
00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative contract thank you madam
 
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.010 align:start position:0%
representative contract thank you madam
chair

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
um just in reading the the current bill
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
HB 1111
 
00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
um the focus is on one particular RSA
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
which is 149 Dash m
 
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
and uh sitting on the study committee
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
that I am now where we're focusing on
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
one RSA I think it's very fruitful
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
because you can do a deep dive into an
 
00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:21.060 align:start position:0%
RSA just to see what's going on and so
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
maybe uh instead of making this broad
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
because the solid working group is
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
already working on that broad thing
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we focus on RSA 149m
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
um to see you know and make that the
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
focus of this study committee I mean
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
because that way we're going through the
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
rsas we're making sure you can invite
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
everyone to the table and see if it is
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
indeed what we we wanted to say what it
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
says or if it needs to be updated or
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
changed and are we meeting the goals of
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
149-1 I think if we we could go from
 
00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:55.859 align:start position:0%
that approach maybe a study committee
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
might be a viable option
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton then
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Homeland representative
 
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.670 align:start position:0%
representative Homeland representative
Bixby

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
Bixby
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair of from my own
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge and edification here the
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
question to representative comp toy is
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
that the the commission that you're
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
working on that's the solid waste study
 
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm I'm on a study committee with
 
00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative homiller and represent
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
Bixby and we're studying soil conditions
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 431.
 
00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:31.190 align:start position:0%
which is RSA 431.
okay

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
um follow up on my thoughts here
 
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.710 align:start position:0%
um follow up on my thoughts here
um

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
if if we have a study committee um
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
we can kind of learn as we go and that's
 
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
that's my case because I haven't got
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
enough experience or knowledge in the
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
matter to be a part of a commission so I
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't even get near that but a study
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
committee is is possible
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
um and and so once again I think that's
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's the only way that I could really
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
vote to go for the study committee
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative komala
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
I I was just gonna add thank you I was
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
just going to add rep Contour you know
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
that that sounds like a a fourth way to
 
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:17.540 align:start position:0%
look at that I appreciate that thank you
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby right so
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
um there um I'd like to I think
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
that looking at
 
00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
um a study committee that looks at
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
Fourth uh 149 and uh or what's is that
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
the right that's correct okay uh is
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
probably it would not actually be a
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up on the epr because
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
um epr is a very is I don't know that's
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
even mentioned in there uh 149 m is
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
basically the uh the chapter and statute
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
that covers all of solid waste stuff and
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
it would I think that would be that
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
would serve a different purpose
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and the question is whether or not we
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:40:13.089 --> 00:40:13.099 align:start position:0%
um look at
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility and how
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
we could uh enact that or also you know
 
00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
if in the process of study we decide
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't make sense or uh whether
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
we want to study existing law and I that
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
might also be a good goal but I don't
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it's what should come out of this
 
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
uh this particular internal study thank
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
you representative Bixby if I may
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
interject for Jeff a moment I do think
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
that um the focus should be on the
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
concept of an extended producer
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility as it applies to 149 M
 
00:40:49.849 --> 00:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
because 149 M May in fact require some
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
sort of amending we don't know to
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
include extended producer responsibility
 
00:40:57.770 --> 00:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
in that concept and so to do so would
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
require a full committee studying
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility as it
 
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
just to answer that question so it is
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
almost certain that when whatever
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
legislation gets written about epr would
 
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
go into 149 now because that is that
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be this the appropriate section of
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
law but
 
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
um that's a different question from
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
whether we need to intensely study it uh
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
I understand what your your point is
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you it's well taken representative
 
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.109 align:start position:0%
thank you it's well taken representative
confla

00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
confla
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just in reading
 
00:41:40.609 --> 00:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
it says here the commissions based on
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
this it's the commission's study shall
 
00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
include can you just tell us what line
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
you're on okay it is line 19.
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it says and then I go on to line 20
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
examining the waste reduction goals
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
established in 149 M then if you go to
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
23 suggested legislation in order to
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
help update RS 149 m
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
and it goes on and then it goes down
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
further I mean so really this commission
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
is all about 149 Dash m is what the
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
again University okay just one moment uh
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
yes representative homela I was just
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
gonna say that just in in reading that
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
it a case could be made that legislation
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
could be written that to look at 149
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
like you were saying with the expressed
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
interest of seeing how extended producer
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
responsibilities could be incorporated
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
into that RSA sort of it's almost like
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you're taking out you're getting one
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
step ahead just by doing that
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
okay I can appreciate your perspective
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bixby did you have
 
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:01.980 align:start position:0%
just reread uh as representative pointed
 
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.930 align:start position:0%
just reread uh as representative pointed
out

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:02.940 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:03.829 align:start position:0%
out
um

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
I think that uh
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
I I could I I think that her Point makes
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
sense that it it does uh look at it
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
would be looking at the RSA 149m
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
particularly with yeah and looking at it
 
00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
through a lens of potentially doing epr
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
but uh there there is a uh perhaps
 
00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:30.420 align:start position:0%
figuring out what aspects of 149m would
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
work with that or not work with that and
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
might need to be changed
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
do it sounds like to me generally we
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
have an appetite for the concept of a
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
study committee are we at a place where
 
00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
we could generally make a a a
 
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.290 align:start position:0%
we could generally make a a a
recommendation

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.190 align:start position:0%
recommendation
um

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
do we feel like we're at that place
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
as a subcommittee
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
we do okay so then I will look to
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
somebody to make a motion of a
 
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.950 align:start position:0%
somebody to make a motion of a
recommendation

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
yes you can first before we do that
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify though
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
as we are making recommendations one way
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
or another
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
um I I feel more strongly about a study
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
committee focused under 149 with a
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility flavor
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
to that so I want to make sure that if
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm affirming a study committee I'm not
 
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
affirming a generalized study committee
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
in which then we could put it in any box
 
00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:32.099 align:start position:0%
later I just want to make sure we are
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about the type of
 
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:36.180 align:start position:0%
study committee sure I think the general
 
00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
sense of what I am hearing from you all
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
is that we would like to look at
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
extended producer responsibility as it
 
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:45.780 align:start position:0%
applies to 149 m
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
is that what you are
 
00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:49.670 align:start position:0%
is that what you are
okay

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.050 align:start position:0%
okay
sure

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton and
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative Contour
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
um are I would think we would have to
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
make a motion to make a recommendation I
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
think we have emotional version okay
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I make a motion
 
00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
that the we recommend a study committee
 
00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:13.460 align:start position:0%
to study RSA 149im with the focus on epr
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
do I have a second uh representative
 
00:45:37.010 --> 00:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.190 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
aye

00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
aye
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay one two three four
 
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
oh one two three four five yes it's five
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
to zero it's unanimous the motion
 
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.010 align:start position:0%
to zero it's unanimous the motion
carries

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:49.020 align:start position:0%
carries
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
and with that uh we have 15 minutes left
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
over until I believe the next hearing is
 
00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
scheduled so I will close out this
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session I appreciate
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
