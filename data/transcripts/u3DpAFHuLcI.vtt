00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming everyone can hear me
 
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
so i see a couple of nods that's a good
 
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
thing um
 
00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
for the record i'm also the
 
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative for uh the town of
 
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
northfield and one-third of the city of
 
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.189 align:start position:0%
northfield and one-third of the city of

franklin
 
00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
um i'm here to talk to you about
 
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
an organization that's near and dear to
 
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
my heart since i've become a
 
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative back
 
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
10 years or so ago
 
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the legislative youth
 
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
i hope you've all taken advantage of the
 
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend one of their zoom
 
00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.229 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attend one of their zoom
meetings

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
or maybe you have submitted legislation
 
00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 align:start position:0%
for them to examine
 
00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
and provide testimony on
 
00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
i think you'll find that they're a great
 
00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
bunch of kids
 
00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.029 align:start position:0%
bunch of kids
and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
and i think they'll probably be our
 
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
replacements at some point in time here
 
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.870 align:start position:0%
replacements at some point in time here
um

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
this is uh
 
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very unusual group
 
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
and one that i think is worthy of our
 
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.469 align:start position:0%
and one that i think is worthy of our
attention

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
in preparation for this i re-read
 
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
the statutes dealing with legislative
 
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
youth advisory council they're available
 
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
in section 19-k
 
00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
colon one two three and four
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
sounds ominous but you could probably
 
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
read it in the time that i take to
 
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
testify here
 
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.429 align:start position:0%
testify here
um

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
they it is very clear from from that
 
00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
those statutes that the goal is to try
 
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
to create a diverse group of uh or a
 
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
cross section of new hampshire students
 
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.310 align:start position:0%
cross section of new hampshire students
whether

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
that is by
 
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
geographic um or socioeconomic
 
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
or by the opportunities of where they
 
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
find their education whether they're
 
00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 align:start position:0%
private schools or public schools or
 
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
charter schools or whatever
 
00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
right to the workforce
 
00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
so what we're hoping to do is try to get
 
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
as diverse a group as we can
 
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what i see
 
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
as a problem um
 
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
and what i was hoping to
 
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
deal with in this legislation
 
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
we currently have
 
00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
four people appointing members to the
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council that
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
would be the senate president the
 
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
speaker the governor and the
 
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
none of these four coordinate
 
00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.430 align:start position:0%
none of these four coordinate
so

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's just by chance
 
00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we end up with a diverse group
 
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
or covering
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
as many of the possible
 
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
organizations or geographic uh areas as
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.309 align:start position:0%
we can
so

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
the proposal in this bill um primarily
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
limit that down to two appointers
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and and recognizing that this is the
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council it
 
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
would seem logical that the legislature
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
are the appointers so i've made the
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
senate president and uh and the speaker
 
00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
the primary um appointers of the
 
00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.309 align:start position:0%
the primary um appointers of the
students

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
um certainly the other two that i've uh
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
deleted off that list of appointers um
 
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
suggest names to those people but i
 
00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 align:start position:0%
think primarily um it would be a good
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
idea if the senate president and the
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
speaker coordinated
 
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
um in order to get as diverse a group as
 
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.309 align:start position:0%
um in order to get as diverse a group as
possible

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 align:start position:0%
and and as you read the statutes i think
 
00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's most evident is
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
that they talk about diversity in a
 
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
number of areas but they don't talk
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
about diversity of thought
 
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
and and that's
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
um i've been involved with this group
 
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
for a little over 10 years
 
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that i'm seeing
 
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
that is a problem for me
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's become a less and less diverse
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
group in terms of thought
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
almost all of their
 
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
decisions uh on legislation
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
come down to a unanimous vote um
 
00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 align:start position:0%
there used to be years ago
 
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
a real give and take a real
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
um pro and con you know
 
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
for those of us that remember 60 minutes
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
used to have point counterpoint um they
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
used to have those kind of discussions
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
and they were terrific uh theater to
 
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.230 align:start position:0%
and they were terrific uh theater to
watch

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
watch
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
they don't do that anymore um it seems
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
that all of the students come from one
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
train of thought and um and they all
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
agree on on what the testimony would be
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
you can imagine and i think part of that
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
reason is um where they're appointed
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
from and i think the other reason is um
 
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line someone has
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
come up with the idea of an application
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
and they're handing out the application
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
or the the current members take those
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
applications and give them to other
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
students that they know
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
and they give them to the students that
 
00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh that think the way that they do um
 
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
they don't look for
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know someone that doesn't think the
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
way that they do and and so it becomes a
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
self-licking ice cream cone here you
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
know you you pretty much know the result
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
um when you come in
 
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.670 align:start position:0%
um when you come in
so

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to see
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
 
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.790 align:start position:0%
i think this bill
retained

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason is i it would give the
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee the ability to see some of
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
their their um council meetings in
 
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.909 align:start position:0%
their their um council meetings in
action

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
action
 
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
um take some of the thoughts that i've
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
given you this morning and apply those
 
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
to those meetings i've had some nice
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with the members of of the
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
council um and they've come up with an
 
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that i think will be
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
introduced today
 
00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
um they've had some great ideas um i
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
think those should be incorporated in in
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
some of the uh
 
00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 align:start position:0%
work over the summer perhaps on this
 
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
work over the summer perhaps on this
group

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
but um more than anything else i'd like
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
this to be
 
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
the way the uh drafters originated
 
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
originally uh designed this it should be
 
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
a a give-and-take organization and it's
 
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
not become that um
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll end i'm happy to
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
answer any other questions about the
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that i proposed
 
00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 align:start position:0%
um but i think it may be best served
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire and for
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
the kids um if we
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
if we talk this over a little bit so
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's where i'll leave it
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
again happy to answer any questions
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative schuett has a
 
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
yes representative schuett has a
question

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative hill
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious why
 
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
if you are concerned
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
about the current appointing
 
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
authorities why didn't you incorporate
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
the way so many of these things are
 
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.710 align:start position:0%
the way so many of these things are
formed

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
formed
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
by naming
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
groups or or persons to nominate
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh names to put forward to those
 
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
appointing authorities
 
00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question and um
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
and if i could i would show you my notes
 
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
um that that says almost exactly that um
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things i thought i'd talk
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
about uh during the
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
study committee of some type
 
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
my idea was would be to use that um
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
that application process
 
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.629 align:start position:0%
that application process
by

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
asking the department of education to
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
to submit a single application to all of
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
their schools all of their contacts you
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
know all of the charter school
 
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.629 align:start position:0%
know all of the charter school
um

00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
user groups um and have them create this
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
pool that the purpose of the application
 
00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
process i believe
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
was to create a pool of applicants
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
we're not getting that pool um
 
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
in a diverse manner and so if we
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
if we had the doe submit that to all of
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
the usual suspects um
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to coin a phrase um
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
that would be a good idea then then it
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
would be the pool that the uh speaker
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the senate president would uh would
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
be able to select from and and get the
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
diversity that i think
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
representative schultz has a question
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you uh
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor for taking my question
 
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.230 align:start position:0%
sponsor for taking my question
um

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'm curious i've also have attended some
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
of the meetings and it's interesting the
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
topics that they picked seem to be
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
things that maybe they would agree upon
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
even if there is party diversity do we
 
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
do we know
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.670 align:start position:0%
do we know
[Music]

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
i'm um to think of the way to word this
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
is the assumption based on the topics or
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
that they pick things that maybe they
 
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
should disagree on or is the assumption
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
that they agree
 
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
because they're all of say a similar
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
uh future party choice because
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
i think the topics they pick to work on
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
seem to be things that they
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not testifying i apologize
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
i'll let you answer my question i
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
apologize it's a good point you make um
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if the tail is wagging the
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
dog or or the dog wagging the tail um
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
it is uh
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
there are subject matters certainly that
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
um that they have always been interested
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
and um and so some of those some
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
it may be a self-fulfilling property as
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
you say um
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
but um but that would be something that
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
we would we would certainly want to
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
discuss and see if there's a a better
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
way to organize it may be something as
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
simple as uh you know the
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:16.839 align:start position:0%
co-chairs maybe
 
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
they um select the bills that the youth
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
evaluates i don't know i you know that's
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair it's just a
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
question of the chair do we need to
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
do a roll call before we start this even
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
though it's a continuation and to make
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
sure nobody has any trouble getting on
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think you're right i i apologize for
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
having forgotten the uh
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
the statement and the roll call
 
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
the statement and the roll call
um

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
after representing fellows has a
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
question and after that we will pause
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
for those technical technical issues and
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
then continue with the hearing
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for the reminder
 
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for the reminder
representative

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um representative
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
hill you've been talking about bills and
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
the legislative advisory council taking
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
positions on
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
bills and you're looking for a diversity
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
in that but is is that really the role
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
of the student advisory council because
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
when i read the statute
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's not what it says it it says it
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
their responsibility is to
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
identify issues that are important
 
00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.110 align:start position:0%
identify issues that are important
to

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
to their
 
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.630 align:start position:0%
to their
cohorts

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
cohorts
 
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
cohorts
and

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
and advise the legislature on these
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
issues and submit an annual report to me
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
that almost sounds more like the
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
functioning of a
 
00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
study commission can you just comment on
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
your perception of exactly what they
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
should be doing
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure um thank you very much for your
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
question um so
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
i agree with you um if you're looking at
 
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
i agree with you um if you're looking at
uh

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
at k colon one um that is exactly what
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
that says if you look on uh at k colon
 
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
three um which are the duties
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
um they talk about uh advising the
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
legislature president and speaker on
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
proposed or pending legislation
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
state budget expenditures and policy
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
matters of youth of concern to youth
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
committees of the legislature and the
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislative study committees commissions
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
on issues of concerning to youth
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
conduct an annual seminar
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
meet no fewer than four times conduct

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
youth find important in new hampshire
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
this is a significant improvement to hp
 
00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.870 align:start position:0%
this is a significant improvement to hp

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
457
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
as it empowers us to engage on all
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
issues that we identify as relevant to
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
young people rather than job growth
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
explicitly as originally mentioned in hb
 
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.190 align:start position:0%

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
457
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
the amended bill also tasks the council
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
with advising the legislature the
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
president of the senate and the speaker
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
of the house on proposed or pending
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
legislation state budget expenditures
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
and policy matters of concern to youth
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
as well as advising the joint standing
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
committees of the legislature
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
on issues of concern to youth
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
all of our members truly appreciate this
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
expansion of the council's functions and
 
00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:33.039 align:start position:0%
we are eager to fulfill these
 
00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:34.630 align:start position:0%
we are eager to fulfill these
responsibilities

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
and i just want to give a bit of context
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
as to how we currently operate um
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
every year our liac members are tasked
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
with having conversations with other
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
young people in their communities
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
because all of us are cognizant that
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
being on the council is a privilege and
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
we are here not only to represent
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
ourselves but our communities of youth
 
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
ourselves but our communities of youth
um

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we have our conversations with
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
members of our school communities our
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
extracurriculars any sort of our larger
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
counties um
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
and our first meeting is always
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
dedicated to bringing forth our findings
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
and the issues that we have found that
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
resonate with youth where we live um
 
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.470 align:start position:0%
resonate with youth where we live um
and

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
we compile a list at the beginning of
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
every year of all of the issues that
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
were brought forth not just by ourselves
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
as youth but as i said by our
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
communities at large
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the issues that i will bring
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
forward as a representative of
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county will be echoed over
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
and over
 
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.950 align:start position:0%
and over
by

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
other members of the council from other
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
counties from other areas across the
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
political spectrum
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
and upon sharing our community's
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
priorities we then determine the ones
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
that have resonated most widely across
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
our council members
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
and through a vote we determine which
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
ones are in the majority and which will
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
garner our focus for the year
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
so this term the issues that
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly stood out were healthcare
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
including mental health
 
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.669 align:start position:0%
including mental health
education

00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
voting rights substance abuse
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
environmental protection and gun control
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
we have organized into interest groups
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
surrounding these issues
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
and between our monthly meetings each
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
interest group identifies legislation
 
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
pertaining to their topic
 
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then they will bring it forth to the
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
entire council where we will discuss ask
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions debate and then vote
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
we then craft statements and deliver
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
testimony like i am today to convey the
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
youth perspective to the legislature
 
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:30.950 align:start position:0%
youth perspective to the legislature
so

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately i appreciate how in amendment
 
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.190 align:start position:0%
ultimately i appreciate how in amendment
672

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
672
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
these functions are explicitly mentioned
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
in the bill allowing us to continue our
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
work and setting this precedent for
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
future councils to be able to have their
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
voices heard in the legislature
 
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
another reason that we support this bill
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
if it passes together with the amendment
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
is that its wording enables us to
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
continue meeting virtually
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
which is likely to be appreciated even
 
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.149 align:start position:0%
which is likely to be appreciated even
post-pandemic

00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
this not only improves the accessibility
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
of the council especially for those who
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
have not yet gained their driver's
 
00:23:03.919 --> 00:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
have not yet gained their driver's
licenses

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
but it allows for greater regional
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
diversity as distance will not be
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
prohibited for participation
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
and it had been in previous years when
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
we were meeting in a centralized
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
location in concord um given that for
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
instance members from the north country
 
00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
would have to drive a very long distance
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
to attend our meetings
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment also stipulates that the
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
council may hold public forums if it
 
00:23:27.679 --> 00:23:28.710 align:start position:0%
council may hold public forums if it
chooses

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
chooses
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
which is also greatly appreciated by our
 
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.990 align:start position:0%
which is also greatly appreciated by our
members

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
we find that public forums are essential
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
to our operations of the council given
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they enable us to fulfill our
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
mission of ensuring youth civic
 
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.230 align:start position:0%
mission of ensuring youth civic
engagement

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
we are very happy to organize these and
 
00:23:43.669 --> 00:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
last year we had been working on
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
planning five across the state before
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
covid19 prevented us from doing so
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
we use these events to hear from experts
 
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
on the topics that we identify that
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
youth care about
 
00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
and spread the word about liax in a way
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
that resonates with young people
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
having it as an optional duty encourages
 
00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
the tradition of forms to be maintained
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
by liak but it adds flexibility that is
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
appreciated given the current public
 
00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
health situation
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment also ensures that council
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
members can represent a diverse
 
00:24:15.029 --> 00:24:15.039 align:start position:0%
cross-section of new hampshire youth
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
including post-secondary youth who are
 
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
members of the workforce
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
this was originally lacking in hb 457 as
 
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.830 align:start position:0%
this was originally lacking in hb 457 as
introduced

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
we believe it is an essential component
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
so that a true diversity of secondary
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
and post-secondary school types and
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
occupations are represented in the
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
legislation legislation
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
including youth who are members of the
 
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.230 align:start position:0%
including youth who are members of the
workforce

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
we also appreciate that the amended bill
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
will create a youth outreach coordinator
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
position as one of our elected offices
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
for the past several years the youth
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
council members have opted to elect an
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
outreach coordinator in order to provide
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
updates to legislators through
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
newsletters as you may have received
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the past and conduct social media
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
outreach to promote youth civic
 
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.789 align:start position:0%
outreach to promote youth civic
engagement

00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
we also appreciate that with the
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
amendment incorporated hb 457 will go to
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
go into effect at the beginning of the
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
next lac term rather than 60 days after
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
its passage
 
00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.110 align:start position:0%
its passage
so

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think um i will suspend my remarks on
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
behalf of the council right now and just
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
add some points on behalf of myself in
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
response to some of the things that
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
representative hill brought forward
 
00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:26.310 align:start position:0%
representative hill brought forward
um

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to mention that one of my
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
favorite aspects of the council is how i
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
know many of its members and have gotten
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
to know them outside of our council
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
meetings and we do represent a diversity
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
of political opinions across the
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
spectrum many of us supported vastly
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
different candidates in the past
 
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
different candidates in the past
election

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
election
and

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the council has taught me is that
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
it is possible for us to unite across
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
party lines
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
and to identify issues that resonate
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
more broadly and to understand that we
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
have this duty to represent not only
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves but our larger communities
 
00:26:03.029 --> 00:26:03.039 align:start position:0%
and that's my favorite aspect about the
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
council we've been able to be very
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
productive in representing what youth as
 
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
a whole think in the communities that we
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
represent and to
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
forge friendships and also a great
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
relationship um like a working
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
relationship to be able to take action
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
on these issues that we identify
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that we may have
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
supported different candidates so our
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
parents may belong to different
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
political parties and i think that is
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
where lyac finds its strength um
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
and then also i would like to add that
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the amended version of uh hb 457 we
 
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.310 align:start position:0%
in the amended version of uh hb 457 we
are

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
incorporating representative hill
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion to have the president of the
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
senate and the speaker of the house as
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
the appointing authorities
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
and i would like to mention that
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
the idea that the application process is
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
behind perhaps lack of diversity of
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
thought is not addressed in hb 457 as an
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
application process is still maintained
 
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.430 align:start position:0%
application process is still maintained
um

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.789 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
i i just wanted to address that because
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that
 
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know is worth bringing up in terms
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
of how the bill and the amendment
 
00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:10.950 align:start position:0%
of how the bill and the amendment
function

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.230 align:start position:0%
function
um

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
and to go back to my testimony on behalf
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
of the council as a whole
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
our council really appreciated the
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take an active role in
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
drafting amendment 672.
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
we believe that the amendment adds
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
greater specificity to the bill
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
developing further on the council's
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and tasks while
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
empowering its members to continue with
 
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
active service to represent new
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire youth as is our mission
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
we are firm in our position that we only
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
support hb 457
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
if it is passed together with amendment
 
00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.110 align:start position:0%
if it is passed together with amendment
672

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
672
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
since that will make beneficial changes
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
that fulfill the council's needs
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you and i would be more than happy
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions you might have
 
00:27:57.029 --> 00:27:57.039 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a question
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
i was looking at the amendment and i
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
where it specifically authorizes remote
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
meetings could you find that for me
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
oh yes um
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
the wording enables remote meetings
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
given that let me split up
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
i believe it says that um
 
00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:18.310 align:start position:0%
i believe it says that um
oops

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
oops
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to pull it up
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
the document is loading for me
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes if you could if you could get
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
back to us on where that is because it
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear to be
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the version either the original
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or the revised amendment
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm concerned if that's necessary
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
it needs to be changed
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
right so what we um
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
we believe that the fact that it says
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
that we may meet no fewer than four
 
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
times per year um
 
00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
is enabling us to meet virtually as well
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
since it does not specify that an
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
in-person location
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
is um mandated
 
00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.510 align:start position:0%
is um mandated
which

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
we worked closely with to draft so that
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
it would provide options for future
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
meetings so we could eventually host
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
them in person or hybrid or online as
 
00:29:09.679 --> 00:29:10.389 align:start position:0%
them in person or hybrid or online as
well

00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:10.399 --> 00:29:12.149 align:start position:0%
well
um

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's the standard
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the word meat but if
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
if you think it's necessary to include
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
hybrid or virtual or online options i
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
would tend to agree with you
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the feedback
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
that might be something adding to the
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to elaborate
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative roy
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you matt thank you for taking my
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
question um i i just have a few concerns
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
about adding the post-secondary um
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
proportion to it
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
isn't the the purpose
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
of the legislative advisory council
 
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
i said advisor council to get the youth
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
prior to them be able to actually hold
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
off themselves
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
people in post-secondary active
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
education can actually run from
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
representatives themselves
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
and you could that could be someone all
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
the way up to age 26 27 years old who's
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
in college influencing freshmen
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
in high school
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about that
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
that great gap
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
in purpose
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge um according to the
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
current statute uh surrounding the
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
council any one between the ages of 15
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
and 22 is able to serve
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
so we decided to maintain that to be
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
able to continue providing that
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
diversity of you know educational type
 
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
so we currently do have
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
high school students from all sorts of
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
different types of schools i personally
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
am educated at home
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have many public school private
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
school members um
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we also do have several college
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
students and members of the workforce
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
and this would be maintained in the bill
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
our current council believes that that
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
is beneficial in representing a
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
diversity of opinions especially because
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
for instance our members of the
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
workforce will bring forth insights that
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
i as a high school student probably
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
would not yet have having not entered
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
the workforce myself um
 
00:31:06.559 --> 00:31:07.350 align:start position:0%
the workforce myself um
so

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
we the council itself does not find that
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
to be a problem and um
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that diversity
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
could be represented in the bill but um
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for bringing forth that
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
point i hope that answers the question
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
i was trying to find my unmute thank you
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%

attend
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
as an observer
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
the meeting that they held yesterday
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
and was quite impressed
 
00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
they had various members
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
assigned to do
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
research on some of these
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
issues that they were dealing with
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
they all seemed very well informed
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
i heard differences of opinions
 
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:00.710 align:start position:0%
i heard differences of opinions
expressed

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
expressed
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
during the meeting and
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
no the votes were not all unanimous
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
and i i just have a question for miss
 
00:32:09.679 --> 00:32:11.350 align:start position:0%
and i i just have a question for miss
rondo

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
rondo
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
i know part of
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative hill's testimony was
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
preparation for jobs and i'm just
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
curious i know you can't
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
speak perhaps for all the members but
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
for yourself
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
i doubt that that was your major major
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
motivation for participating can you
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
expand on that a little
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you that's a very good
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
question um and i appreciate you coming
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
to join our meeting
 
00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:40.870 align:start position:0%
to join our meeting
um

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
i think my motivation for joining the
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
council was having an opportunity to
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
meet youth across the state um
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
who all you know were
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
united by the common goal of wanting to
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
participate in the government and
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
valuing public service and civic
 
00:32:56.159 --> 00:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
valuing public service and civic
engagement

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
engagement
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
and also just a personal
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
passion and desire to take action on
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
some issues that i see in my community
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
and that i would like to mobilize around
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
and i think that that stands true for
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of our members many of them
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
are really joining the council with the
 
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
desire to be able to
 
00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
meet with legislators and
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
learn about the government's process um
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i think we were
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
as a council i can say we were rather
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
confused to see in
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
hb457 the fact that a responsibility of
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
the council would be to prepare and
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
execute programming on job growth
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
given that the council itself
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
has constantly you know been taking
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
action not only on job growth but on
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
learning about and representing and
 
00:33:46.389 --> 00:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
um providing the youth perspective on
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
all issues that we bring forward as
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
important and identifying our
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
communities as i mentioned before so i
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
think that while job growth is a very
 
00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:57.200 align:start position:0%
important issue that many of us
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
find ourselves concerned about and
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
wanting to understand and take action on
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
it should not be the only thing that the
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
council focuses on
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
but to that point about job growth i
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
think that's why it's very important to
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
be able to allow post-secondary youth
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
who are members of the workforce to be
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
part of the council and provide their
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
perspectives as our amendment would
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
allow because then we could eventually
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
take further action with more informed
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
and diverse perspectives on job growth
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
but of course included but not limited
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
to job growth
 
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:29.909 align:start position:0%
to job growth
um

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
since as i said the goal is to represent
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
all of youth's perspectives on a
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions represents
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we have a website but i
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
could send you the roster um i would
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
have to check with representative
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
alexander our legislative co-chair as to
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
how um
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's george
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
it was it's probably also on the house
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
website under statutory committees
 
00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes representatives another question
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
i want to ask you about your outreach
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a better question for
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
representative hill because
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
something's very puzzling i've taught at
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
salem high school for 25 years
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
i've been on edna eight years nobody at
 
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
salem high school has ever heard of this
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
group i've never seen a physician paper
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
a white paper on any point of view
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
you've been invisible for me except
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
through notices in the calendar
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
so what are you doing to spread the word
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative hill maybe
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to answer the question for
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
my perspective but
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sure representative hill might have
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
additional insights um
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
we have these past two years appointed
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
an outreach coordinator with the goal of
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
increasing our outreach since we know
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
that that's something we definitely must
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
improve on
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
at this point our outreach consists of
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
compiling newsletters to legislators
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
which you may have received one i think
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago with all of the
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
bills that we have taken action on um
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
this past year and crafted testimony on
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
and voted in favor or against um so we
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
have been doing that for several
 
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.870 align:start position:0%
have been doing that for several
newsletters

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
newsletters
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
since last year and the beginning of
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
this year and we hope to continue that
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
and begin those on a monthly basis just
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
so legislators can be updated on
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
what the council is doing and we also do
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
have social media accounts on facebook
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
and instagram and twitter through which
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
we do post updates on our statements and
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
our positions
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
as well as our meeting dates and times
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
and our members and their biographies
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
and where they're from
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
so i definitely
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
encourage anyone who's interested to
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at our social media accounts
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
we definitely agree that increasing our
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
outreach is something that is essential
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the council which is why we
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate that amendment 4 the
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb 457 includes an outreach
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
coordinator position so one of our
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
members can actively take charge of
 
00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
workers on fellows thank you madam chair
 
00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:26.069 align:start position:0%
workers on fellows thank you madam chair
um

00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%

miss drondo uh can can i'm a little
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with the fact that there's 21
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
members of the council and the terms
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
that you serve are at least two years so
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
that's only 10 new people a year
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
that have an opportunity to participate
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering if you could share how
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
the members that are on the council
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
came to be selected
 
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.910 align:start position:0%
came to be selected
and

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
kind of two questions and the other
 
00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
question is in terms of outreach is
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
there any outreach to other students so
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
that they have some opportunity to
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
participate even if they're not
 
00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
yes definitely um i think to your first
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
point i am not the most knowledgeable
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
since as the youth co-chair i'm not in
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
charge of or involved in the application
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
process um
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
but uh i think that is sort of outlined
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
in the legislation itself and i know
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
that for instance to be on the council
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
myself i actually heard about it from
 
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
a fellow um member who mentioned that
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
she was on the council and she had
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
enjoyed it and encouraged me to apply so
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
the application was online and i
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
sent it to our email address and then i
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
taken by representative porter who was
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
the legislative coach at the time and
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
forwarded to
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
the governor secretary of state senate
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
president and speaker of the house
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
to be evaluated
 
00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of our outreach
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
we have been focusing on outreach to
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
other youth which is why we do put an
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
emphasis on our social media
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
which has allowed us to reach a lot of
 
00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
youth in the state and let them know
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
about what we do
 
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.349 align:start position:0%
about what we do
um

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
and then another aspect of our
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
programming that we really enjoy and
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
hope to continue doing our public forums
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
and in the past we have hosted these at
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
high schools and community centers
 
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.270 align:start position:0%
high schools and community centers
um

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
and they're essentially events on
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
different issues where we bring
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
regional experts on different issues and
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
we bring in state representatives and we
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
have student panels and these are
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
outreach events designed for youth to
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
attend so that they can learn more about
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
the council and also about the issues
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
that are relevant to youth
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
we were unable to host any last year
 
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
given the pandemic but we are hoping to
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
host some virtually this year and we
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
keeping those forums as the amendment
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
would do will allow us to continue our
 
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
outreach directly to youth with really
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
meaningful um
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
programming so that they can learn more
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
about the council and these different
 
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
about the council and these different
issues

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
and be empowered to engage in new
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative broder has a
 
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.950 align:start position:0%
thank you representative broder has a
question

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
yes i actually have a statement because
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents is on this um
 
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.310 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents is on this um
council

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
his name is brody parrott
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
and all i did was point him in the
 
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
direction of the
 
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.270 align:start position:0%
direction of the
um

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
application because it's something that
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
he himself was very interested in and he
 
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:38.960 align:start position:0%
went through the whole process on his
 
00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.829 align:start position:0%
went through the whole process on his
own

00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
so this is available to anyone who um
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
who applies
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's at the recommendation of a friend
 
00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
or a fellow representative so let's not
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
i want to recognize that we ourselves
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
have responsibility to introduce youth
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
other questions representative roy
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
thank you um i i know you said that you
 
00:41:14.069 --> 00:41:14.079 align:start position:0%

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
could you give us a breakdown of the uh
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the demographics of the of the
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
committee with regard to
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
private school parochial school public
 
00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't have access to the roster
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
immediately so i'm not entirely sure
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
about the numbers and the demographics
 
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i know that we do have public school
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
private school college home school
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
online school
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
and workforce representation at the
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
moment um
 
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:48.880 align:start position:0%
although i don't have um the clear
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown right in front of me but i can
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
look for that and send it along if you
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
would be interested
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for follow-up um
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%

you have anyone from any parochial
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
schools for example catholic high
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
schools or colleges
 
00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
i am not entirely sure but i do not have
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
the roster in front of me so i i may
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
just be unaware i can send that along
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%

request of the sponsors number one and
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%

and i think
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the advisory council is
 
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.069 align:start position:0%
the fact that the advisory council is

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
thing i think having uh

seconded by roy

and i will speak to this
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
it was a repeat
 
00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
it didn't incorporate any of the
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations that this committee made
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
to the author last year
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
this session the oplc reviewed it and
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
found a number of issues
 
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
found a number of issues
with

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
its its broad approach
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's it is not ready for prime
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
time and i don't think it's
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
as written i don't think it's
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily a good base to work from so
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%

put forward from the last iteration of
 
00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
this bill seemed to have been

this bill seemed to have been
incorporated

00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
maybe if we kill it this time the lesson
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
to be talked about because
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
while my education was very brief in
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
this area i think i'm not so much
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
interested in naming a day as i am a
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
permanent building director to uh
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
honor somebody like wentworth cheswell
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
who was really quite a remarkable man
 
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
little education i've gotten
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
i i'm not i just don't want to throw
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
these away i don't know what to do with
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
them but
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
maybe i can't for now but i'd let them
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
come back uh i certainly much more this
 
00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
come back uh i certainly much more this
is

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
this woman was certainly courageous
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
but wentworth shedswill did a lot more
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
for our republic
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:54.390 align:start position:0%
and uh
i

00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
this is just a
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's not a simple area as far as i'm
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
concerned i'd like to see something done
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair i was just
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
going to point out that
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
we did have an amendment i believe put
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
forward by
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative scitec on this bill
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
and was curious if he wanted to have
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
that considered
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
we have to deal with the itl before we
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i i just represented
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
i would certainly vigorously support my
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
amendment for reasons if we get there to
 
00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.270 align:start position:0%
amendment for reasons if we get there to
uh

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.470 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
but let's we'll wait for that
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
yes i would agree with representative
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
scitec that we should certainly not pass
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
this bill unamended
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
because we had the information that the
 
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
honoree preferred her married name to
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
her maiden name and didn't like the
 
00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
nickname so
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
i think it would be embarrassing
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
for us to pass the bill on moments
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile we're discussing itl and
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative goldie wishes to say
 
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.069 align:start position:0%
representative goldie wishes to say
something

00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and
 
00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
days into statute um naming days
 
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
days into statute um naming days
i'm

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.710 align:start position:0%
i'm
against

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
but i i think this might need just a
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
little more
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
study and looking into uh as
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative scitec has said
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
so i would be in favor of retaining we
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything from
 
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
the peace uh trade port on the airport
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
or a number of other things dealing with
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
this bill and i'm
 
00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
leaning towards retaining
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
and groups and fellows
 
00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i just um
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
am reacting to what representative
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
scitec said about retaining and i think
 
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's important to
 
00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.030 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's important to
honor

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
honor
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
um some of these people that we have
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
named bills about
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
but there may be a better way to do it
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
than just passing individual bills for
 
00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
example i'm not saying i'm not trying to
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
put anything on the table but i just
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
think that there are other possibilities
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
that can be explored
 
00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i would prefer retain so i'm going to
 
00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.309 align:start position:0%
so i would prefer retain so i'm going to
vote

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
no on the itl
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
i still i still move itl i i just
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
i think you could find uh we could find
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement on cash naming uh
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
he's uh for uh wentworth chaswell which
 
00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:50.720 align:start position:0%
would be another issue altogether
 
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.829 align:start position:0%
would be another issue altogether
that

00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
as far as just taking this this name
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
off the calendar day i think that we
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
should just put that
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
put that to rest right now and then
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to something else
 
00:55:03.359 --> 00:55:04.549 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to something else
representative

00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
well a couple things first that there's
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
such a thing as a friendly ipl i'm going
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
to call it that
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
but uh i'm going to say that
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative goalie sort of
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
embarrassed me the fact is
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
we really haven't talked
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
heard from keys and it's kind of nervy
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
to just name the building without
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
running it by them and having
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
letting them
 
00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:28.470 align:start position:0%
letting them
uh

00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
bless the thing i don't know why they
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
would object but the fact is it's
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
impolite and i think it's a wonderful
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:40.640 align:start position:0%
other uh comments
 
00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.670 align:start position:0%
other uh comments
questions

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
all right in that case the motion is itl
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:56.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
realistically why does the new hampshire
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
state legislature have to be involved in
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
the naming of something that's in
 
00:56:02.309 --> 00:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
portsmouth can't the city of portsmouth
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
just handle that why is why is this all
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
because it was included in a bill that
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
let's just say that we don't normally do
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
this but we can actually we do normally
 
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:18.640 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
we get naming bills every year we named
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
a roundabout in uh
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh off 101 in the name of a local
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.789 --> 00:56:44.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature the only body that's
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
required to do this can the city of
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
portsmouth not handle this on their own
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
i believe that the peace authority has
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know that's it's their building they
 
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
can call it what they want however if we
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
tell them to call it something different
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
they have to go along is i believe the
 
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
right representative schmidt has a
 
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
right representative schmidt has a
comment

00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair so
 
00:57:17.069 --> 00:57:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
represent county representative
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
steve fournier uh with regard to this
 
00:57:26.789 --> 00:57:26.799 align:start position:0%
issue but of course uh peas is not the
 
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
property of the city of portsmouth
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
nor the city of newington it's property
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the state um and uh the the state
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh has
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
the control over the legislature
 
00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh sorry as the board of
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
peace because it appoints most of the
 
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
members um
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
we've named bridges
 
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.190 align:start position:0%
we've named bridges
for

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%

her virtues a day
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
on the state statutes
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
i do think we can consider the naming of
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
the terminal at peace
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
and come up with a
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
name either her proper name or
 
01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
someone else that might be more
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that terminal and i
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:23.839 align:start position:0%
our legitimate
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
one of our legitimate issues is what we
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
call that terminal this is the perfect
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt do you should
 
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:40.640 align:start position:0%

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair uh
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've already pointed out and it is known
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
haynes i believe was the last stains um
 
01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:54.150 align:start position:0%
haynes i believe was the last stains um
uh

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
was a slave of the
 
01:00:58.710 --> 01:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
first president of the united states
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh and she
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
made not just a a dash for her freedom
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh and but she fought for it
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh the the former president
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh or justice column george washington
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
made numerous attempts
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
to have her
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh return to his ownership
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh so it was an ongoing battle uh you
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
know as i said the book
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
is held by the portsmouth library in
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
their rare books room uh that tells the
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
story of her struggle to
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
maintain her liberty
 
01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
there could scarcely be uh something
 
01:01:43.109 --> 01:01:43.119 align:start position:0%
that would be more indicative of a
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
person's worth than their
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh than their successful struggle
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
against the most powerful man in the
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
united states
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh and uh so naming uh a terminal for
 
01:01:55.119 --> 01:01:55.910 align:start position:0%
uh uh and uh so naming uh a terminal for
her

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh it could be uh
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
a symbol of
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
our respect
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%

and
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%

all right
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
the communication is a little bit
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
difficult this morning i did not hear
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
that last remark
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
the motion was by representative lekkis
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative allegro ought
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
to pass with amendment 0256 which you
 
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
have already passed
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair you came so loud
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
um looking back on my notes
 
01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
um looking back on my notes
we

01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
actually voted on ought to pass with
 
01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
actually voted on ought to pass with
amendment

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
back on the 26th
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no outcome
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
then we voted on itl
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
and there was no out
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
the votes were nine to nine right so we
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
are now going to have
 
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
since we there was intervening business
 
01:07:03.589 --> 01:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
we can make a new motion about to pass
 
01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
with the amendment
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have to reconsider either of
 
01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.390 align:start position:0%
we don't have to reconsider either of
those

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
no if they if we had finished with the
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment motion and
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
it failed then we would have to
 
01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.309 align:start position:0%
it failed then we would have to
reconsider

01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
reconsider
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
since it is
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
there was intervening business namely
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl
 
01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
um i'm still a little confused i i
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
thought with a thai vote
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
that that would be considered having
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
failed yes representative the motion of
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with the amendment failed
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
a subsequent motion of itl also failed
 
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
we can with there has been
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
things have elapsed time has elapsed
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
business has been done and now we make a
 
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
new motion that is on its passive
 
01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.230 align:start position:0%
new motion that is on its passive
amendment

01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
there's been no successful amen no
 
01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
successful motion on this bill except
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the adoption of the amendment
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay president would you like to speak
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
to your motion i would thank you um
 
01:08:11.109 --> 01:08:11.119 align:start position:0%
from the testimony we heard
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
the uh you know for both the itinerant
 
01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
vendors and the uh peddlers um this the
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
amendment combined the two
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state's office is is
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
doing almost nothing i mean they're
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
collecting the fee and issuing the
 
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.749 align:start position:0%
collecting the fee and issuing the
license

01:08:27.749 --> 01:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
but um they're really not doing any
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
checks on the people
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know who applied other than they did
 
01:08:33.679 --> 01:08:35.349 align:start position:0%
you know who applied other than they did
apply

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:36.470 align:start position:0%
apply
and

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
testimony was that they've never had to
 
01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
make use of the bombs that are put up
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
at least in the memory of the assistant
 
01:08:44.709 --> 01:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
and in his memory there's uh
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
never been any complaints um so
 
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
never been any complaints um so
basically

01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
in my view this bill is doing nothing
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities and towns
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
have the ability to pass ordinances
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
related to this on their own
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing i mean there was concern
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
expressed about people that might be
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
going door to door to uh
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
either to maybe case houses to see if uh
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know no one's home so they might uh
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh at least my interpretation of what we
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
said so they might you know rob the
 
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.070 align:start position:0%
said so they might you know rob the
place

01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
or commit a burglary and um
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
or they might be uh you know
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
going door to door to offer some
 
01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
fraudulent product
 
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:32.829 align:start position:0%
fraudulent product
and

01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
um the issue there is i mean such people
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
are unlikely to uh i mean almost
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
certainly aren't going to get a license
 
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
certainly aren't going to get a license
anyway

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't see it offering much
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
protection the only possibility is that
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know i suppose someone said the
 
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
police could check and see if they have
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
a license
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't really
 
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.870 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't really
um

01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
you know they could and that you know
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
they could report them for that but i
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
think in most cases um
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
people that do this sort of thing are
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of maybe taking
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of people
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
and in most cases they're not going to
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
end up calling the police
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i really don't i see this offering
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
and i really don't i see this offering
um

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know almost no benefit whatsoever
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
and for the legitimate people um doing
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
business who do get a license it's some
 
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
additional trouble and cost and i think
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
the people that are doing this kind of
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
work are kind of on the bottom end of
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know there may be exceptions but i
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
mean they're struggling to get by i
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
suspect in most cases and i don't see a
 
01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
reason to put
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
even a relatively small burden on them
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that's why i uh
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know i'm going to be voting on to
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
sons of uh
 
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.590 align:start position:0%
sons of uh
allegra

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
allegra
 
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
allegra
um

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
i agree with everything that
 
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative lekka said
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
but what i'll do is reserve my own
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
reserve putting it into my own words to
 
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.430 align:start position:0%
reserve putting it into my own words to
come

01:10:59.430 --> 01:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
only if it's necessary later
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just uh i i don't have 218
 
01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
right in front of me um it would take me
 
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
a minute or so to look for it but
 
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.669 align:start position:0%
a minute or so to look for it but
i

01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
the title is itinerant vendors so aren't
 
01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
we talking about the people who set up
 
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:24.400 align:start position:0%
um a tent and sell things out of a tent
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
in a parking lot where this is not a
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
bill about going door-to-door
 
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:11:32.550 --> 01:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
that was 217
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that we adopted the
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
last time we discussed this bill
 
01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
combines the two bills and repeals both
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
the amended title the amended title is
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
now repealing rsa 20 relative to hawkers
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
and peddlers and rsa 321 relative to
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
itinerant vendors
 
01:11:57.910 --> 01:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay i'm i'm sorry i think i must have
 
01:12:01.990 --> 01:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.590 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's not her
 
01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.270 align:start position:0%
it's not her
0256

01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:07.280 align:start position:0%
0256
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it simply
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
deletes both rsas
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
deletes the mention of them in the
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
 
01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak
represent

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
the thing that
 
01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
the deal breakers i can't think of a
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
better word is when i heard that even if
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
the person applying for the license puts
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
down criminal background
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i just wanted to say so
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair again i'll
 
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
repeat my refresh my remarks from the
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
last time
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh we should definitely should not be
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
removing uh the state
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
statute with regard to hawkers and
 
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.070 align:start position:0%
statute with regard to hawkers and
peddlers

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
peddlers
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
the committee had this a very vigorous
 
01:13:11.970 --> 01:13:11.980 align:start position:0%
discussion on this about 10 years ago
 
01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:13.270 align:start position:0%
discussion on this about 10 years ago
[Music]

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the testimony from the towns
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
as i recall was all
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of having some sort of state
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
involvement uh so that uh
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
put at the mercy of people who are going
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
to come to a town
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
and then go to another town and another
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
town and another town that's what they
 
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.270 align:start position:0%
town and another town that's what they
do

01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
um and and to the degree that the state
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
has issue
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
issues or license it's not the money
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
they make that was misinterpreted the
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
last time they made the remark the the
 
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
aspect is not whether the state makes
 
01:13:54.790 --> 01:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
any money at it the the the question is
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
whether the state loses any money at it
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
which they don't because the cost of the
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
license operation is covered by the
 
01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:03.910 align:start position:0%
license operation is covered by the
license

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
and for the state to have at least a
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
registry so that the town can call up
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
and find out whether they've complied
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
with the first step
 
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
of the statute which is to get a license
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that the towns can still
 
01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh act against these people just means
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
that they everybody has to be on the
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
alert with no central uh uh collection
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
of information agency which the state
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
would be under the statute so leave it
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
alone it's doing no harm and it's doing
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
some good for sure
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
thank you now that i found the right
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
amendment um i'm opposed to this bill
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
because one i mean in addition to that
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
all the things other people have said
 
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
about you know people taking advantage
 
01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.669 align:start position:0%
about you know people taking advantage
of

01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
of
um

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
senior citizens and that sort of thing
 
01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
that if people are going door to door in
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
a rural section of the state like where
 
01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
i live
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
they they are not going to it's not
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
going to be feasible for them to try to
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
stop in every town and go to the town
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
clerk and get a license because the town
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
clerks aren't even open on all days and
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
if if they're really
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
up and up
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
on the up and up then it would be easier
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
for them to just get a license with the
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
state and then they can go to any town
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
in in the state and and do their their
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
business so it even from a business
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
perspective this doesn't make any sense
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
first the license is meaningless but the
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
second question is from representative
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
fellows the can the town not insist on
 
01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:50.830 align:start position:0%
fellows the can the town not insist on
its

01:15:50.830 --> 01:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
own um
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
licensing in addition to whatever the
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
state license is yes you can and and
 
01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes so so what
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent allegra
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'm i'm
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
going to vote for the repeal uh in other
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
words i'm going to vote for 218. i have
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh three reasons first is that peddling
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
is a
quintessential

01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
quintessential
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
american act of commerce
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
and it seems that what we've done in
 
01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
this and in so many other cases is we've
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
taken that liberty away and now we want
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
to sell it back with a license uh
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
something that we should all be at
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
liberty to do is to sell something to
 
01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.350 align:start position:0%
liberty to do is to sell something to
somebody

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
number two is that uh
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is as representative lekker
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
said and i just want to emphasize it and
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
express it in my own terms
 
01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
crooks do not register so
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
this law as it currently stands is moot
 
01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.590 align:start position:0%
this law as it currently stands is moot
third

01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
third
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know about other folks on this
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee but i've known a number of
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
people who work as peddlers
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
or hawkers whatever you want to call
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
them setting up sandwich stands at fairs
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
going door to door to try to sell their
 
01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.830 align:start position:0%
going door to door to try to sell their
wares

01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
wares
 
01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.189 align:start position:0%
wares
they're

01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
working hard
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
to scratch out a living
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
and we're going to force them to be
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
licensed to do this now
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
here's the real crux of this for me
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line and some of the
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
testimony or
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
comments i heard might not have even
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
been in this room
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
i heard someone say that if they saw
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
somebody driving down their street and
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
going door to door
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
they would be worried
 
01:17:46.229 --> 01:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
then a
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative just a few moments ago
 
01:17:49.199 --> 01:17:50.310 align:start position:0%
representative just a few moments ago
said

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
or expressed that going from town to
 
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.950 align:start position:0%
or expressed that going from town to
town

01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
and door to door
 
01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's what they
 
01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.630 align:start position:0%
that's what they
do

01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think referring to uh
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
these people are expecting that they
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
are dishonest
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
because of the means that they a lot of
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
these people can't afford a storefront
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
or to pay a web designer so they can
 
01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
sell their wares online they go
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
door-to-door they're scratching out a
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
living i think that referring to them as
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're expecting them to be uh
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
dishonest or criminal
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
is uh highly
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
prejudicial and that's why i'm in favor
 
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
of letting these people
 
01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
make their living without
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
additional regulation
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i will be
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
voting against this motion um as i've
 
01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
stated in
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh the previous
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
exact session we had on this
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
that these are
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
folks that are doing transient sales
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
like we discussed that the by the time
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
one town catches on if they have an
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance that you shall get a license
 
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
it shall be registered these individuals
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
already in the next town i think it's
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to track
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
where their movement is and
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
who they really are if we don't have a
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
state tracking and state licensing on
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
this um so for that reason i'll be
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
voting against and i don't think this
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
prohibits anyone
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
from selling their wares
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
whether they have to go through the city
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
or the town or to the state for
 
01:19:28.719 --> 01:19:29.830 align:start position:0%
or the town or to the state for
licensing

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
no one is denied the opportunity to do
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
that without delay with the license
 
01:19:35.669 --> 01:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
hey madam chair i would just like to say
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
that when i commented and said that they
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
go town to town in in door to door that
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
i did not say that they were dishonest
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
my comment was that it would be easier
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
for them to get one license from the
 
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:56.149 align:start position:0%
for them to get one license from the
state

01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak on house
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay the motion is ought to pass with
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
amendment 0256 made by representative
 
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.390 align:start position:0%
amendment 0256 made by representative
leckus

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
leckus
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
and the clerk i raised my hand madame
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
chair i agree thank you representative
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
schmidt you may speak thank you for for
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
speaking no no it's okay it's you got a
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
lot to do there
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
i i didn't say that's what i i also
 
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
spoke on this issue i didn't say that's
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
what they do
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
i said that's what they do
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay they go from town to town now it is
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
an old-fashioned existence but that
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that nobody does it um and
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh that hawkers and peddlers are uh all
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
dishonest i i but certainly to the
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
degree that people go from door to door
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
in and from town to town uh is a
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat precarious existence um and uh
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
to the degree that and this is one of
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
the things that
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
that is a common phenomenon in towns uh
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
and that's at all so common in the
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
cities is that people have long
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
driveways um and uh and they they
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
many people like their privacy they
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
prize it that's one of the reasons they
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
live out in the towns uh one of the
 
01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
reasons they live out in the towns is so
 
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
they can have more privacy they have
 
01:21:30.630 --> 01:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
frequently have long driveways and their
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
houses are kind of out of sight
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's what they like and that's fine i
 
01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with that if i had
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
a big piece of property maybe i'd have
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
that arrangement too
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the point is that to the degree that
 
01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.350 align:start position:0%
so the point is that to the degree that
that

01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.149 align:start position:0%
that
that

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:46.229 --> 01:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
there may be some people
 
01:21:48.630 --> 01:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
who uh will take advantage of a of an
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity um
 
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
you're you're a betting effectively uh
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're in a nefarious activities but
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that people want to be
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
in privacy some people put up a sign
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
says no trespassing or no peddlers and
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on uh
 
01:22:06.239 --> 01:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on uh
uh

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
it all goes to
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
respecting the people's desire for
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
privacy and not to be bothered
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
um but not everybody that feels that way
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
puts up a sign so we have a strat we
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
scheme i'll call it not no negative
 
01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
connotation to the to the term but we
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a concept in statute that's been
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
there for decades
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been doing any harm it's been
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
giving the state and the towns a little
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
bit of methodology and modality to
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
to try to keep people safe
 
01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.270 align:start position:0%
to try to keep people safe
and

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
this this desire to
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
clear the statutes of everything that
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
somebody conceives to be unnecessary
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
or out of touch with with modern day
 
01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.870 align:start position:0%
or out of touch with with modern day
realities

01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
realities
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
uh is no argument to do it when there's
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
clearly some benefit to it and it's been
 
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
there for years
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
no problem so let's leave it to do its
 
01:23:07.679 --> 01:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
no problem so let's leave it to do its
job

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt is
 
01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
there anyone else represent bailey
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
i i was interested by representative
 
01:23:18.149 --> 01:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
lakers's remark that
 
01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:18.950 align:start position:0%
lakers's remark that
it

01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
they collect the fees and it
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
pays for the collecting of the fees but
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
but nothing ever happens like it's the

all right and yes excuse me how can
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
there be even a discussion of consent
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
with a split vote of 10 to 9. it was
 
01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.950 align:start position:0%
with a split vote of 10 to 9. it was
facetious

01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
facetious
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%

01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
we will discuss that among us
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
all right so the minority recommends itl
 
01:25:17.750 --> 01:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't know if there's going to be
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
a report
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
i apologize for for not recognizing the
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
chairs uh you know joe attempted humor
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
is the phrase
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
that would be insulting to call it an
 
01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative

all right
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to move itl on house bill
 
01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.790 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to move itl on house bill

01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%

01:25:59.350 --> 01:25:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative site seconds
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say that this is
 
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.510 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say that this is
another

01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:12.709 align:start position:0%
another
repeat

01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
we got it back we had it last year we
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
worked on it extensively
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
and this version does not include any of
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
the work that we did so i think that the
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
people that spent quite a lot of time
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
working on it are
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been disrespected
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'd also like to point out that the
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure can't
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
tell if it's a regulatory board or a
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
advisory board so it's very badly
 
01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
advisory board so it's very badly
written

01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
there's no rule writing authority
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's no discipline possibilities for
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
someone who is a
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
music therapist and misbehaves and there
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
are no penalties so
 
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
basically it's a way for somebody to
 
01:26:58.870 --> 01:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
show to hank to hand
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
their music therapist certification and
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
the check
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
and get a stamp that says now you can
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
get insurance reversal that's all it
 
01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.910 align:start position:0%
get insurance reversal that's all it
does

01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
i don't appreciate that
 
01:27:14.239 --> 01:27:15.590 align:start position:0%
i don't appreciate that
uh

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:18.070 --> 01:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's it's a sloppy bill i wouldn't want
 
01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
to pass it
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i would also mention that every
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
single person who spoke in favor of this
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
was either a music therapist
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
or someone who was receiving music
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
therapy and wanted their insurance to
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
pay for it that's all it's cute it's not
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
a question of whether music therapy is
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
useful or desirable
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
it's simply who pays for it
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
if i can remember my parliamentary
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry on this uh last year was this
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
licensing is designed to protect public
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
and however meritorious this discipline
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
may be i cannot see a threat
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
worthy of legislation
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
of state interest
 
01:28:06.070 --> 01:28:06.080 align:start position:0%

i was just uh attempting to make a bit
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
of a joke saying i assume this pi had an
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
if i know in it
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
it was properly formatted yes i do
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak on this
 
01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:35.430 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to speak on this

representative schmidt
 
01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will just say
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
slightly disagree with my distinguished
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh colleague from the latin department
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just health and safety but it
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
is to impose some standards in
 
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.390 align:start position:0%
is to impose some standards in
professions

01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
professions
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
so that that the that the public
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh had should have some uh degree of
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
assurance that the practitioner has some
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
comp level of competence um and that
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's not to be sneezed at if the the
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
chairs characterization of the bill is
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
sloppy and uh and so forth may well be
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
the case uh
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
the people who offer the bill may not be
 
01:29:24.629 --> 01:29:24.639 align:start position:0%
any more immune to the effects of the
 
01:29:26.709 --> 01:29:26.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic than we are
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
so uh i will be voting against the
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
motion uh because i
 
01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
think uh that the
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
practitioners have made a decent
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
argument even if the
 
01:29:42.390 --> 01:29:42.400 align:start position:0%
if the form of the bill is uh
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh is defective in this instance
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bailey and
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the part that concerned me was
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
that the audio therapists testified that
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
they thought this encroached on their
 
01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:01.669 align:start position:0%
they thought this encroached on their
turf

01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
turf
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
that and that would speak to your
 
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
point that it was poorly written that
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
the boundaries between the two fields
 
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah uh
 
01:30:17.590 --> 01:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt if i may address
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
you on this point there's actually some
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
maybe a little crack of some
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
slight area of agreement that i think we
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
can forge but i want i've resisted
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
saying this about the last bill let me
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
just throw it in fast i've never seen us
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
so divided on on the nothing bill i mean
 
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.070 align:start position:0%
so divided on on the nothing bill i mean
so

01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
our common sense tells you you don't see
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
people swarming the streets and
 
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.750 align:start position:0%
people swarming the streets and
defrauding

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
defrauding
 
01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative schmidt there was
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
someone somewhere in this proceeding
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
this session and i don't have the memory
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
to know it where one of the disciplines
 
01:30:59.030 --> 01:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
had strong professional standards but
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
not licensing do you remember who that
 
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.590 align:start position:0%
not licensing do you remember who that
was

01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
and music therapists have both
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
professional standards they are
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
organization there is a certification
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
and there are there is a professional
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
organization that sets standards and
 
01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
people can meet those standards
 
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:26.790 align:start position:0%
people can meet those standards
uh

01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
and call themselves a certified uh
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
music therapist
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.709 --> 01:31:38.719 align:start position:0%
could i um make a suggestion
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative yes i'm so sorry i didn't
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
raise my hand
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
apologies um
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
since there seems to be so
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
since we
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
since we looked at this book could you
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
speak a little louder i can't understand
 
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:53.189 align:start position:0%
speak a little louder i can't understand
you

01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:53.199 --> 01:31:54.070 align:start position:0%
you
okay

01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
i think i didn't have my volume online
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
much better much better sorry
 
01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
um since um
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
we have such concerns over the bill
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
about the way it's written and the fact
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
that it didn't include some of the
 
01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.550 align:start position:0%
that it didn't include some of the
um

01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.229 align:start position:0%
um
language

01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if we could get through
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
this vote and i'm going to vote no in
 
01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
hopes that we'll retain the bill
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
because we do have a language that has
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
passed this committee before
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
and we could use that language to
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'll ask i'll ask i'll add i
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is going to be a
 
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
but you worked on it last year
 
01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:42.470 align:start position:0%
but you worked on it last year
and

01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
the work was completely ignored
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
oh i think representative schmidt had
 
01:32:50.950 --> 01:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
his hand up before mine
 
01:32:52.790 --> 01:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes but he's already spoken three times
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
so true okay thank you madam chair sorry
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
about that i think that
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a philosophical
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
difference in our committee and that's
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know something that happens i just
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
for the record since we've talked about
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
the sort of components we would like
 
01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
to see in such legislation
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a good idea to
 
01:33:12.639 --> 01:33:14.149 align:start position:0%
i think it would be a good idea to
include

01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
music therapists art therapists and any
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
other type of therapist that work
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
especially with patients
 
01:33:24.149 --> 01:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
after trauma and the specialized type of
 
01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:25.030 align:start position:0%
after trauma and the specialized type of
care

01:33:25.030 --> 01:33:25.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
that the patients who do well with these
 
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
types of therapies receive and include
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
it with the
 
01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:33.669 align:start position:0%
it with the
overall

01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
statutes around therapists in general
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.709 align:start position:0%
and i think that
um

01:33:40.709 --> 01:33:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
i think that given the seriousness of
 
01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.550 align:start position:0%
i think that given the seriousness of
which

01:33:44.550 --> 01:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
this committee has taken mental health
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
issues in the past and this session i
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
think that it would be something that
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
would benefit us all
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
to look at these modalities as another
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
couple tools in the toolbox
 
01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.229 align:start position:0%
couple tools in the toolbox
um

01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
to assist people
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
resistance for whatever reason to talk
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
therapy to have these other options
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
available to be covered by their health
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
insurance is certainly something that
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
would be good i wish we didn't even have
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
to legislate that i wish it was already
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
happening but i think given how
 
01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:21.870 align:start position:0%
complicated ptsd
 
01:34:21.870 --> 01:34:23.350 align:start position:0%
complicated ptsd
[Music]

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
childhood trauma etc is i think that we
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
should look at all these modalities that
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
are available and unlicensed
 
01:34:30.719 --> 01:34:31.510 align:start position:0%
are available and unlicensed
to

01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
retain this bill
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
and look at creating better statutes
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
around these types of alternative
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
therapies that are helpful to many
 
01:34:42.790 --> 01:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
people that's just my two cents
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
and why i will vote against the motion
 
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
to itl so that we can retain it
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
um so to my distinguished colleague from
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
salem uh
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
we are in in this day and age uh in so
 
01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
many ways uh captives uh
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
as well as beneficiaries to some degree
 
01:35:08.239 --> 01:35:09.030 align:start position:0%
as well as beneficiaries to some degree
of

01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
the insurance sector uh and so
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
this situation is such that
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
that things that are uh you know put
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
forward as therap
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
as therapies
 
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh very often are covered by insurance
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh and therefore um to the degree that
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
someone is is
 
01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a license no matter how
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
qualified and how much they're
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledged by their by their by their
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh professional boards
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
or oversight agencies uh to be competent
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
and and worthy of a license to the
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
degree that the state does not provide
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
them a license opportunity the insurance
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
companies won't pay for the coverage so
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that's just a reality that that
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
they have to deal with and the fact of
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement by their peers uh does
 
01:36:03.430 --> 01:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
not entitle them to coverage by
 
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:04.709 align:start position:0%
not entitle them to coverage by
insurance

01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that this committee of
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
which the democratic members are all
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
experienced with except representative
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
brian whereas on the
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
on the republican side we have a bunch
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
of people for whom this is all brand new
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
um and and uh not all obviously the
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
experience members are not in that
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
category but the new members are not
 
01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
experienced and so for them it's a new
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
world uh and so
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
you see the it's not just a
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
philosophical difference but also
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
what we've dealt with excuse me
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt thank you for
 
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.270 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt thank you for
your

01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
discussion about the nature of the
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
committee would you care to comment
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
my only concern one of my major concerns
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that we
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're saying you know we need to pass
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
this so that insurance covers it
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
passing this would not guarantee
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage that's just wonderful
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
the insurance company can still decide
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to cover it this
 
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't mandate coverage all it does is
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
provide for a license so
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should be in the
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
business of picking and choosing
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
things based on hopefully the
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company to cover something
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
represent side check i want to ask the
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
question out loud
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
point blank
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
do we
 
01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
accept as a criterion for licensing only
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
for sure not maybe only but the fact
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
that that will provide insurance
 
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:43.590 align:start position:0%
that that will provide insurance
coverage

01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
public health public safety and
 
01:37:48.310 --> 01:37:48.320 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage should that be a new
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
criterion can you just accept that yes
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i would like to mention to
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
01:37:57.510 --> 01:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
that her concern about therapy that the
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
music therapists explicitly said they
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
are not mental health therapists
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
more aligned with the
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
speech language pathologists they are
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
primarily working in the schools
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're not like the art therapists who
 
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.590 align:start position:0%
they're not like the art therapists who
were

01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
mental health therapists with this the
 
01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:20.950 align:start position:0%
mental health therapists with this the
specialist

01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and madam chair did have a
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
hand up before you speak i wasn't
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to respond to what you
 
01:38:30.629 --> 01:38:30.639 align:start position:0%
said i did want to say though to the
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
point about insurance i think
 
01:38:36.229 --> 01:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
that is just an auxiliary component of
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing a profession that's
 
01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.030 align:start position:0%
recognizing a profession that's
legitimate

01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
and should have standards in licensing
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
or certification i think that while it's
 
01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:46.639 align:start position:0%
not formally on the list
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh given how insane our health insurance
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh is about coverage i think it is
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
something unfortunately we have to
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
consider that legitimizing professions
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
through licensing
 
01:38:58.229 --> 01:38:58.239 align:start position:0%
and certification at the state level is
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
a really important thing
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
for the tools in the toolbox i think
 
01:39:04.709 --> 01:39:04.719 align:start position:0%
that is an important auxiliary component
 
01:39:06.229 --> 01:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
of it but
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know
 
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:09.590 align:start position:0%
uh i don't know
i

01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at
 
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.550 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at
that

01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%

02:59:59.190 --> 02:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the um
 
03:00:02.389 --> 03:00:02.399 align:start position:0%
executive committee um i am uh
 
03:00:04.070 --> 03:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative rosemary rung for the
 
03:00:06.550 --> 03:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
record i represent hillsborough district
 
03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:09.439 align:start position:0%
21 which is the town of merrimack
 
03:00:11.510 --> 03:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
i come before you to introduce house
 
03:00:13.750 --> 03:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill 141
 
03:00:14.950 --> 03:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
which would
 
03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
establish a registry for firefighting
 
03:00:19.110 --> 03:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
foams in new hampshire
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
that contain pfas
 
03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason this bill is so important
 
03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
is that we've seen in new hampshire
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
several communities whose drinking water
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
has been contaminated by pfas chemicals
 
03:00:35.670 --> 03:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
it could be from a landfill it could be
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
from in merrimack we have uh industrial
 
03:00:38.479 --> 03:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
from in merrimack we have uh industrial
contamination

03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
03:00:43.030 --> 03:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
and it's it doesn't take a lot of pfas
 
03:00:45.990 --> 03:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
for it to have serious health impacts so
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
understanding where pfas is in our state
 
03:00:51.030 --> 03:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
is important as many
 
03:00:53.670 --> 03:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
residents derive their drinking water
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
from groundwater
 
03:00:55.680 --> 03:00:56.950 align:start position:0%
from groundwater
and

03:00:56.950 --> 03:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:00:59.670 --> 03:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
we know that as pfas leeches into the
 
03:01:01.590 --> 03:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
ground from the use of fire fighting
 
03:01:01.600 --> 03:01:02.950 align:start position:0%
ground from the use of fire fighting
foams

03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
foams
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
that contain pfas
 
03:01:07.190 --> 03:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
it contaminates the groundwater
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to ask the committee to
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
consider this bill it ought to pass i'd
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
actu i'd like now to actually have
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
former representative uh the honorable
 
03:01:18.710 --> 03:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
nancy murphy speak on this bill
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
it was first
 
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
introduced and passed uh the committee
 
03:01:24.870 --> 03:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
in-house last year
 
03:01:28.790 --> 03:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
but was ended up in covid purgatory
 
03:01:31.030 --> 03:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
so if i could ask nancy murphy chairman
 
03:01:33.030 --> 03:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you could indulge me to allow her to
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
speak more in more detail and answer any
 
03:01:38.309 --> 03:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
questions the committee has
 
03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:44.490 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:44.490 --> 03:01:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:51.429 --> 03:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:52.950 --> 03:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair and honorable
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:01:56.230 --> 03:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
my name is nancy murphy i'm a merrimack
 
03:01:57.830 --> 03:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
resident who had the honor of serving my
 
03:01:59.510 --> 03:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
community in the house as a rep last
 
03:01:59.520 --> 03:02:00.550 align:start position:0%
community in the house as a rep last
term

03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
while there um i filed uh hb 150 1569
 
03:02:07.670 --> 03:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it was a bill that would require des
 
03:02:09.670 --> 03:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
to create and maintain a public uh
 
03:02:11.910 --> 03:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
publicly accessible a triple f
 
03:02:14.469 --> 03:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
registry uh that was my appreciation and
 
03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
thanks to representative wrong and the
 
03:02:18.950 --> 03:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill's co-sponsors reappears today as hb
 
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:21.110 align:start position:0%
bill's co-sponsors reappears today as hb
141.

03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
141.
 
03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
um i i um
 
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
sort of just briefly for people that
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what a triple f is um it
 
03:02:30.389 --> 03:02:30.399 align:start position:0%
stands for aqueous film forming foam
 
03:02:33.190 --> 03:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's a class b fluorinated legacy foam
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it has pfas in it it works by
 
03:02:37.269 --> 03:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
cooling and smothering a fire so it
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
can't reignite
 
03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
it's often used to fight flammable
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
liquid fires at military installations
 
03:02:43.990 --> 03:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
and airports
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
when a triple f is utilized to put out
 
03:02:48.309 --> 03:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
fires the spray contents wind up on the
 
03:02:48.319 --> 03:02:49.429 align:start position:0%
fires the spray contents wind up on the
ground

03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
ground
 
03:02:51.830 --> 03:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
the foam which contains pfas
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
seeps out into the soil and binds to the
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
soil particles and stays there
 
03:02:57.830 --> 03:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
every time it rains or water reaches the
 
03:02:59.990 --> 03:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
soil pfast compounds are forced into the
 
03:03:02.309 --> 03:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
groundwater potentially contaminating
 
03:03:04.630 --> 03:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
the drinking water
 
03:03:06.630 --> 03:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
chair can i just
 
03:03:09.030 --> 03:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
ask that the representatives adult
 
03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
former representative
 
03:03:13.590 --> 03:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
indulgence we've got some cross talk yes
 
03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
that i'm hearing
 
03:03:17.269 --> 03:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i hear it too i'm not i don't know
 
03:03:19.750 --> 03:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
if whoever's has the background noise
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
including the dog please mute yourself
 
03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.399 align:start position:0%
actually everyone should mute yourself
 
03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though there's a television
 
03:03:34.230 --> 03:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
or radio playing in the background
 
03:03:36.150 --> 03:03:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you appears to have been muted
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
by whatever background noise it was
 
03:03:42.070 --> 03:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
please continue miss murphy oh thank you
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
um i i asked i i provided my testimony
 
03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
here in terms of questions um are pfes
 
03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:48.550 align:start position:0%
here in terms of questions um are pfes
really

03:03:48.550 --> 03:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
all that big of a deal and why is a
 
03:03:53.110 --> 03:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
triple f concern
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
like many other states across the nation
 
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is dealing with the
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
environmental and public health impacts
 
03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
of pfas of our air water and soil
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
they take decades to break down in
 
03:04:04.309 --> 03:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
nature and they bio accumulate in the
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
human body
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
they've turned up in water supplies and
 
03:04:09.750 --> 03:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
in every county in new hampshire
 
03:04:11.830 --> 03:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
many public and private drinking water
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
supplies are contaminated which based
 
03:04:16.150 --> 03:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
upon current research emerging science
 
03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
and new enforceable drinking water
 
03:04:19.510 --> 03:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
standards would deem them unsafe to
 
03:04:21.990 --> 03:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
drink we need safe drinking water to
 
03:04:22.000 --> 03:04:22.950 align:start position:0%
drink we need safe drinking water to
live

03:04:22.950 --> 03:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
live
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
though we're all exposed to toxins on a
 
03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
daily basis some new hampshire citizens
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
are at a greater risk of associated
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
health impacts from pfas exposure
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
simply due to proximity to a pollution
 
03:04:36.389 --> 03:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
or contamination source
 
03:04:39.030 --> 03:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
or occupational exposures like dod
 
03:04:41.190 --> 03:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
military sites such as pease air force
 
03:04:41.200 --> 03:04:42.230 align:start position:0%
military sites such as pease air force
base

03:04:42.230 --> 03:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:04:43.990 --> 03:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and that experienced by firefighters
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
using a triple f
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
their body's uh ability to detoxify
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
chemicals can make a difference and the
 
03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulation and other properties of
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
these environmental toxins
 
03:04:57.590 --> 03:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
unborn babies and young children
 
03:04:57.600 --> 03:04:58.870 align:start position:0%
unborn babies and young children
exposed

03:04:58.870 --> 03:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
exposed
 
03:05:00.870 --> 03:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
can be exposed in utero because it
 
03:05:02.950 --> 03:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
crosses the placenta and during
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding or bottle feeding uh with
 
03:05:08.230 --> 03:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
formula mixed with pfas contaminated
 
03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
water um the baby's blood levels go up
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
um infants and young children have the
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
highest levels of pfas in their blood
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
around age 12 it seems to go down
 
03:05:20.070 --> 03:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
because the children grow um and it's
 
03:05:21.910 --> 03:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
sort of pfas gets dispersed in their
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
body but by adulthood
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
pfas exposed males have higher levels
 
03:05:28.950 --> 03:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
than females as they don't shed pfas
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
through menstruation or
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding health impacts um are
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
certainly concerning uh associated with

03:06:09.750 --> 03:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
covalent vaccine
 
03:06:11.110 --> 03:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
reduces birth weight and head
 
03:06:13.110 --> 03:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
circumferences in babies
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
and uh they're looking to see right now
 
03:06:18.309 --> 03:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
there's growing evidence that it also
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
affects growth learning and behavior of
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
infants and older children
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
um it's really important that this
 
03:06:28.230 --> 03:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
a triple f registry be created
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
a triple f foams are a major source of
 
03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
pfes contamination and environmental
 
03:06:37.439 --> 03:06:39.269 align:start position:0%
pfes contamination and environmental
exposure

03:06:39.269 --> 03:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
03:06:41.190 --> 03:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
this registry will create a publicly
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
accessible data collection tool that
 
03:06:45.910 --> 03:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
will enable des to track the presence of
 
03:06:48.790 --> 03:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
and thus citizen exposure to class b
 
03:06:50.710 --> 03:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam associated pfest
 
03:06:52.389 --> 03:06:52.399 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
03:06:54.309 --> 03:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
when des knows where the p fast from the
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
a triple f is impacting groundwater or
 
03:06:58.870 --> 03:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
is likely to do so it can take action to
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
assist communities in the protection of
 
03:07:02.710 --> 03:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
that drinking water in public health
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
i see this bill as sort of the first and
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
necessary step in a process that could
 
03:07:09.030 --> 03:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
eventually coordinate with the work of
 
03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:11.110 align:start position:0%
eventually coordinate with the work of
dhhs

03:07:11.110 --> 03:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
it would make it possible to plot an
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
overlay on gis mapping uh class b
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam-associated pfas
 
03:07:17.920 --> 03:07:19.030 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam-associated pfas
exposure

03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
and potential health impact data from
 
03:07:20.560 --> 03:07:21.990 align:start position:0%
and potential health impact data from
dhhs

03:07:21.990 --> 03:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
dhhs
 
03:07:23.830 --> 03:07:23.840 align:start position:0%
it would be a valuable data collection
 
03:07:25.269 --> 03:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
tool that would have great potential to
 
03:07:27.030 --> 03:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
assist both agencies
 
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
it would bring us one step closer to
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
providing data that can lead to answers
 
03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
that are being asked now by des dhhs and
 
03:07:35.429 --> 03:07:35.439 align:start position:0%
at least two statutory committee
 
03:07:37.429 --> 03:07:37.439 align:start position:0%
commissions that i can think of relative
 
03:07:39.429 --> 03:07:39.439 align:start position:0%
to pfas drinking water contamination and
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
health impacts
 
03:07:45.190 --> 03:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
des um supported uh this bill in 2020
 
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh they
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
their their suggestion they felt that it
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
would identify where foams would have
 
03:07:54.870 --> 03:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
been released it would help the agency
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
prioritize investigative and clean up
 
03:07:59.590 --> 03:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
resources and ensure clean safe drinking
 
03:08:01.030 --> 03:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
water is provided to new hampshire
 
03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
water is provided to new hampshire
residents

03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:08:04.230 --> 03:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
also the fact that it would be public
 
03:08:06.070 --> 03:08:06.080 align:start position:0%
would help inform the public about this
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
topic of high interest
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
with limited resources in time why
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
should we do this
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is ranked number one in
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
the nation for pediatric cancer breast
 
03:08:19.510 --> 03:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
cancer bladder cancer and esophageal
 
03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
cancer bladder cancer and esophageal
cancer

03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's known to be associated with cancer
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
and other concerning health issues
 
03:08:26.469 --> 03:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
and cancer we know is an environmentally
 
03:08:28.309 --> 03:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
triggered chronic disease
 
03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cancers are
 
03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:31.510 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cancers are
preventable

03:08:31.510 --> 03:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
preventable
 
03:08:33.429 --> 03:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
although it's a simple registry may not
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
seem particularly important nor that it
 
03:08:37.590 --> 03:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
should be considered a priority for for
 
03:08:40.070 --> 03:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
this committee when access to and the
 
03:08:41.910 --> 03:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
availability of safe drinking water
 
03:08:44.230 --> 03:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
water that we need to to nurture and
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
sustain life
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
and public health protections from toxic
 
03:08:49.830 --> 03:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
chemicals that have such concerning
 
03:08:51.429 --> 03:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
associated health
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
outcomes and long-term environmental
 
03:08:55.429 --> 03:08:55.439 align:start position:0%
impacts around the line that simple
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
registry tool becomes far more valuable
 
03:09:00.389 --> 03:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
i would ask that the committee please
 
03:09:02.070 --> 03:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
consider the value of this bill to the
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
many thousands of granite staters whose
 
03:09:05.269 --> 03:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
drinking water and health is at risk
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
from pfas and a triple f and allow 141
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to move forward and be
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
voted on by the full house
 
03:09:14.230 --> 03:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
effective and safe methods for putting
 
03:09:15.830 --> 03:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
out oil fires are
 
03:09:17.269 --> 03:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
critical to protecting health and
 
03:09:19.429 --> 03:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
property however pfas containing
 
03:09:21.830 --> 03:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam has created a toxic
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
legacy across the state and poses an
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
occupational hazard to firefighters who
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
train with it and use it likewise when
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
class b foam seeps into groundwater
 
03:09:34.150 --> 03:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
and contaminates drinking water citizens
 
03:09:36.150 --> 03:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
across the state are unknowingly being
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
exposed exposed to these very dangerous
 
03:09:39.910 --> 03:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
chemicals that are known to be linked to
 
03:09:42.309 --> 03:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
such concerning health outcomes policy
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
makers must take action to protect
 
03:09:46.150 --> 03:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water public healthy in the
 
03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
environment i ask that you vote otp on
 
03:09:51.990 --> 03:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
hb 141 so the des will have a tool that
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
it needs to help protect new hampshire's
 
03:09:55.910 --> 03:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
vital natural resources and the public
 
03:09:57.910 --> 03:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
health of granite staters thank you for
 
03:09:59.590 --> 03:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
your time
 
03:10:01.030 --> 03:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you miss murphy are there any
 
03:10:03.429 --> 03:10:03.439 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
03:10:03.439 --> 03:10:05.190 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
representative

03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
would you uh send your testimony by
 
03:10:07.279 --> 03:10:08.469 align:start position:0%
would you uh send your testimony by
email

03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
email
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely surely thank you
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
03:10:15.990 --> 03:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.230 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
representative

03:10:18.230 --> 03:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
the honorable
 
03:10:22.630 --> 03:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
i can't remember your name nancy
 
03:10:24.070 --> 03:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
nancy yeah
 
03:10:25.830 --> 03:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any
 
03:10:29.030 --> 03:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
idea about how often this occurs in the
 
03:10:32.070 --> 03:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
state like how many times a year this
 
03:10:35.670 --> 03:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
foam is discharged
 
03:10:37.510 --> 03:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your question
 
03:10:38.950 --> 03:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
um actually
 
03:10:40.870 --> 03:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
that part of the that's part of the
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
problem is um there's not been a lot of
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
documentation and and record keeping um
 
03:10:49.349 --> 03:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
it depends upon the department some
 
03:10:50.950 --> 03:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
departments you have used it more than
 
03:10:52.790 --> 03:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
others certain areas like the fire the
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
training academy would use it all the
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
time uh for training purposes
 
03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
many fire departments don't use it at
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
all so the um the issue is that um
 
03:11:06.389 --> 03:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of of this um
 
03:11:08.070 --> 03:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam stored in different
 
03:11:10.469 --> 03:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
places all over the state and i know uh
 
03:11:12.150 --> 03:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
when i wrote this bill senator tom
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
sherman had written a senate bill 257
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
which um
 
03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
was adopted and in 2019 and part of his
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill required that um des survey
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities um about what they have
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
in stock and that actually was just i
 
03:11:31.590 --> 03:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
just saw a december um
 
03:11:31.600 --> 03:11:32.309 align:start position:0%
just saw a december um
uh

03:11:32.309 --> 03:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:11:35.510 --> 03:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
report from that from ges and i i mean
 
03:11:36.389 --> 03:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
depending upon the there's only about 50
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
compliance and i think in uh 58 percent
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
of compliance responded to the survey
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
and about 32 percent of those people
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
that responded had no a triple f
 
03:11:49.439 --> 03:11:53.190 align:start position:0%
that responded had no a triple f
um

03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
there were reports of 8 375 gallons
 
03:11:57.910 --> 03:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
either in storage or on apparatus were
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
identified and that will be need to be
 
03:12:01.750 --> 03:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
disposed of and then another five
 
03:12:03.110 --> 03:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
additional responding firefighting
 
03:12:04.870 --> 03:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
entities listed an additional six
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred and twenty one
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
gallons of a triple f in new hampshire
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
um the the part is is it's it's this
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
storage it's um the usage and
 
03:12:16.870 --> 03:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
looking the important part is to look
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
back and to see where it was was
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
discharged because
 
03:12:23.429 --> 03:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
it may not be used now but a prior spill
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
could have impacted the groundwater in
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
certain areas so that's the concern it's
 
03:12:29.030 --> 03:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually not going to
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
most places are not using it they're
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
using fluorine-free
 
03:12:36.150 --> 03:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
foam so it's not it's it's really much
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
less of an active problem now but the
 
03:12:39.990 --> 03:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
damage has been done so that's really
 
03:12:42.790 --> 03:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at is to see um where
 
03:12:46.469 --> 03:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
it is and and uh you know what what uh
 
03:12:49.110 --> 03:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
groundwater needs to be be tested
 
03:12:51.990 --> 03:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
so follow up please
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
03:12:58.389 --> 03:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
if it's not
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
your biggest or big concern seems to be
 
03:13:03.349 --> 03:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
what has already happened
 
03:13:05.590 --> 03:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
but this bill
 
03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
but this bill
doesn't

03:13:07.110 --> 03:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:13:07.120 --> 03:13:08.230 align:start position:0%
doesn't
doesn't

03:13:08.230 --> 03:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:13:09.830 --> 03:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
only requires them
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about what they have now and
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
going forward correct no
 
03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
no thank you for the question no this
 
03:13:20.790 --> 03:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
actually requires that um the fire
 
03:13:23.190 --> 03:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
departments or it wasn't just fire
 
03:13:25.349 --> 03:13:25.359 align:start position:0%
departments because there it is uh this
 
03:13:27.190 --> 03:13:27.200 align:start position:0%
almost stored in places other than fire
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
departments um and i try to look at the
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
the um the language
 
03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
the um the language
uh

03:13:34.229 --> 03:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:34.239 --> 03:13:35.269 align:start position:0%
uh
where

03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:13:38.790 --> 03:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
it says on on in section c and d
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
of all locations where this film is or
 
03:13:44.469 --> 03:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
has been stored captured collected
 
03:13:46.710 --> 03:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
managed or disposed of
 
03:13:48.550 --> 03:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
and indeed
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
any known dates and locations where the
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
phone has been discharged in the past
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:59.120 --> 03:14:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chairwoman i i do
 
03:14:10.950 --> 03:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh is there
 
03:14:15.510 --> 03:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
when fire departments mostly that i'm
 
03:14:17.830 --> 03:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
concerned with providing information of
 
03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the historical data
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
that they have used these such as uh
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
class uh b type of fires
 
03:14:28.229 --> 03:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
or other incidents where
 
03:14:30.550 --> 03:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
their intention was to extinguish the
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
fire for the uh the public good does
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
anything in this
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh bill
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
hold harmless to municipalities
 
03:14:40.319 --> 03:14:41.269 align:start position:0%
hold harmless to municipalities
who

03:14:41.269 --> 03:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
at the time that was the only
 
03:14:46.469 --> 03:14:46.479 align:start position:0%
extinguishing agent that had the class b
 
03:14:46.479 --> 03:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
extinguishing agent that had the class b
capabilities

03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:48.950 align:start position:0%
capabilities
or

03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
also too is more than just class b type
 
03:14:52.870 --> 03:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
of fires
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
a triple f was also using uh alcohol and
 
03:14:58.469 --> 03:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
ketones which is why
 
03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
that particular phone was
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
so dramatic and so universally used but
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill because this
 
03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
information will be provided by the
 
03:15:12.229 --> 03:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities honed them within harm of
 
03:15:16.150 --> 03:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:18.229 --> 03:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your question um no it
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to any liability the
 
03:15:22.389 --> 03:15:22.399 align:start position:0%
purpose was not for liability it was
 
03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
really to to have a tool to investigate
 
03:15:25.840 --> 03:15:26.790 align:start position:0%
really to to have a tool to investigate
where

03:15:26.790 --> 03:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:15:29.750 --> 03:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is or where it has been so that the
 
03:15:32.229 --> 03:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
groundwater can be examined and drinking
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
water can be protected so without the
 
03:15:37.750 --> 03:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
the information in a central place for
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
des they don't know
 
03:15:42.229 --> 03:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
it would it would clue them into where
 
03:15:43.910 --> 03:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
they might need to because it's going to
 
03:15:45.590 --> 03:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
be a big task we know
 
03:15:48.309 --> 03:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
department of defense sites we know you
 
03:15:52.150 --> 03:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
know fire um fire departments airports
 
03:15:54.710 --> 03:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
we we know it's everywhere um and it
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
will help prioritize work for des
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
because um i i know um
 
03:16:02.469 --> 03:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
this pfest thing has sort of become a
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
nightmare for our state and um this is
 
03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
one of the the uh
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
the uh big contributors of of be fast so
 
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
i it does not address
 
03:16:15.190 --> 03:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't the intent
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh to to do for liability or anything
 
03:16:19.990 --> 03:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
like that i mean i think it's i think
 
03:16:22.309 --> 03:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
our whole state is covered so it's not
 
03:16:25.030 --> 03:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard for anybody to
 
03:16:27.830 --> 03:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
i would think sue anybody or or or
 
03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:29.110 align:start position:0%
i would think sue anybody or or or
really

03:16:29.110 --> 03:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:16:31.349 --> 03:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
a hold liability when it's our whole
 
03:16:33.750 --> 03:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
our whole federal government our
 
03:16:36.309 --> 03:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
you know our our states our towns our
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities i
 
03:16:40.870 --> 03:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a huge issue so it's really
 
03:16:40.880 --> 03:16:41.830 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a huge issue so it's really
a

03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
a a
 
03:16:46.790 --> 03:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
registry for purposes of determining
 
03:16:49.349 --> 03:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
safety of the water more than it is and
 
03:16:51.190 --> 03:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
that has any it has nothing to do with
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
with life
 
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative you had a question well
 
03:16:56.710 --> 03:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you madam
 
03:17:01.830 --> 03:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
chair uh it will be very brief uh i see
 
03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
in line 13 section d it says within 120
 
03:17:05.200 --> 03:17:06.070 align:start position:0%
in line 13 section d it says within 120
days

03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
of the effective date you want the
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to give you
 
03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
of any of their known dates
 
03:17:16.309 --> 03:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
in some of our larger departments where
 
03:17:18.229 --> 03:17:18.239 align:start position:0%
they probably have somewhere in the
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
avenue of
 
03:17:23.190 --> 03:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
30 000 reports that they uh that they
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
respond to annually
 
03:17:28.550 --> 03:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
many of it was done in the past prior to
 
03:17:31.990 --> 03:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
the use of computers do you feel the 120
 
03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:33.269 align:start position:0%
the use of computers do you feel the 120
days

03:17:33.269 --> 03:17:33.279 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:17:35.510 --> 03:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned this bill is enough
 
03:17:35.520 --> 03:17:36.389 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned this bill is enough
time

03:17:36.389 --> 03:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to provide that
 
03:17:38.399 --> 03:17:40.229 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to provide that
information

03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
i would certainly be uh
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
think that an amendment if if the time
 
03:17:46.469 --> 03:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
frame was really the issue i think i
 
03:17:47.830 --> 03:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the the time frame was set with the
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
goal of compliance um and to to have an
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
end date and to a start date and i i'm
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
sure for especially larger departments
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
um that would be challenging i i know
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
des is um it's been
 
03:18:05.590 --> 03:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
any interactions that i've seen with
 
03:18:07.990 --> 03:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
them around pfes has been very um
 
03:18:10.710 --> 03:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
amenable to to time frames but certainly
 
03:18:12.870 --> 03:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
if the committee felt that that time
 
03:18:15.670 --> 03:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
frame was was a problem you know i i
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
would certainly understand a need to
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
to change that
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
very good thank you representative thank

03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i understand your
 
03:18:59.830 --> 03:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
question uh
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
that other other commissions you mean or
 
03:19:02.239 --> 03:19:03.349 align:start position:0%

the hb 737 which is the um
pfas

03:19:16.309 --> 03:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
commission related to bedford merrimack
 
03:19:21.429 --> 03:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
litchfield and uh londonderry probably
 
03:19:21.439 --> 03:19:22.150 align:start position:0%
litchfield and uh londonderry probably
and

03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:19:22.160 --> 03:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
very much a lot of the work that we're
 
03:19:26.550 --> 03:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
doing on all these commissions and i
 
03:19:28.550 --> 03:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
would imagine it's similar in in your
 
03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
commission is um
 
03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
trying to get a handle on this problem
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we and the problem is we all know it
 
03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
exists we talk about it we have we have
 
03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
concerned citizens really concerned
 
03:19:43.750 --> 03:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
about their health um and there's no
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
data collection there's no way to to
 
03:19:47.990 --> 03:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
give people a sense of where do we need
 
03:19:51.190 --> 03:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
to prioritize um assistance from des or
 
03:19:54.070 --> 03:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
dhhs so i know in the other commissions
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um targeting particular health impacts
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
you know that from like the c8 study um
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
to start there um i know d uh dhhs has a
 
03:20:07.030 --> 03:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
new um computer program that's that's
 
03:20:08.710 --> 03:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
coming in i think that will be helpful
 
03:20:10.630 --> 03:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
um and i i think like this registry
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
would be helpful as as much to dhhs as
 
03:20:18.630 --> 03:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
it would to uh to des so i i am i think
 
03:20:20.790 --> 03:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be valuable any data that we could
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
get gives us uh a foundation and i think
 
03:20:25.190 --> 03:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we're struggling on in a lot
 
03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:26.800 align:start position:0%
of commissions is that we just don't
 
03:20:29.110 --> 03:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
have the data we're not collecting it so
 
03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
this was a tool that
 
03:20:32.950 --> 03:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
the es fell would be would be helpful to
 
03:20:32.960 --> 03:20:34.229 align:start position:0%
the es fell would be would be helpful to
start

03:20:34.229 --> 03:20:34.239 align:start position:0%
start
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up medium chair
 
03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure that um
 
03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:39.830 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure that um
other

03:20:39.830 --> 03:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
groups we would have as access to this
 
03:20:45.670 --> 03:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
data through d yes is that what you're
 
03:20:45.680 --> 03:20:46.630 align:start position:0%
data through d yes is that what you're
saying

03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:20:47.830 --> 03:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for the question yes it
 
03:20:49.349 --> 03:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
would be a public it would be it would
 
03:20:50.950 --> 03:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
des would be would keep it and it would
 
03:20:53.190 --> 03:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
be publicly available yes for for
 
03:20:54.550 --> 03:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
whatever needs that that other
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
commissions would have shore okay thank
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you representative
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um look at the
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
bill i noticed that the phrase class b
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam is used in five places
 
03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam is used in five places
however

03:21:09.110 --> 03:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
however
 
03:21:11.110 --> 03:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
in only one of those five does it say
 
03:21:12.389 --> 03:21:12.399 align:start position:0%
does it add you know class b
 
03:21:13.910 --> 03:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam
 
03:21:15.830 --> 03:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
to which pfast chemicals have been
 
03:21:17.590 --> 03:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally added
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and my question is are there class b
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
firefighting phones that do not include
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh pfas and if so
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
isn't this going to require reporting of
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
things that really aren't a concern
 
03:21:31.750 --> 03:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
in some cases
 
03:21:34.150 --> 03:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge class b firefighting
 
03:21:34.160 --> 03:21:35.190 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge class b firefighting
foams

03:21:35.190 --> 03:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
foams
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
um have pfest
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
and actually a um we have a i know a
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
person that will be testifying
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
after me is is a pretty good expert on
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
firefighting um equipment and foams and
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
such and certainly can probably answer
 
03:21:52.389 --> 03:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
these questions but to my note to my
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge um
 
03:21:55.590 --> 03:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
class b
 
03:21:58.309 --> 03:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh firefighting foams repel carbon
 
03:22:00.630 --> 03:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
they're fluorinated uh so and they have
 
03:22:00.640 --> 03:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
they're fluorinated uh so and they have
pfas

03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
so um i
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
actually think that was an olf um
 
03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:07.830 align:start position:0%
actually think that was an olf um
creative

03:22:07.830 --> 03:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
creative
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:14.870 --> 03:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah it's just i noticed it
 
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
because i was wondering why it was in
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
one place and not all the places and i'm
 
03:22:20.389 --> 03:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
also i guess the expert maybe can answer
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
but wondering whether there might not be
 
03:22:24.229 --> 03:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
developed if there aren't already a
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
class b firefighting phone that would
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
not happen fast thank you yes thank you
 
03:22:30.309 --> 03:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge yes thank you
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:36.550 --> 03:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:22:38.309 --> 03:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh and looking at
 
03:22:41.349 --> 03:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
and i just want to follow up on
 
03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien's take on this
 
03:22:47.510 --> 03:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
because uh being a retired firefighter
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
03:22:52.630 --> 03:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
the reports shall include
 
03:22:55.590 --> 03:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
and this is shell location date time and
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
volume of the discharge
 
03:23:01.910 --> 03:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
um is it like i said as a retired
 
03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
firefighter we didn't keep records of
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
the amount we dispersed in a given
 
03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:07.910 align:start position:0%
the amount we dispersed in a given
location

03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm just wondering on when this is a
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
shall report
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
how you
 
03:23:15.990 --> 03:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
think this information will be collected
 
03:23:19.110 --> 03:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
if there is no record of it
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um i i i
 
03:23:23.030 --> 03:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
think that's an excellent point and i
 
03:23:24.630 --> 03:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
think that's going to be an expectation
 
03:23:27.190 --> 03:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
i you know i don't think fire i have
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
many family members who are firefighters
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
and um in discussions with them i know
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
historically things were not necessarily
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
kept and there was not a uh in
 
03:23:39.190 --> 03:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
anticipation that there would be a need
 
03:23:41.190 --> 03:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
to do to to do so
 
03:23:43.510 --> 03:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think the point will be more to
 
03:23:45.510 --> 03:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
provide the information that's available
 
03:23:47.190 --> 03:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
and i think unders i think gs is going
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
to certainly understand that
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
not everybody is going to have all the
 
03:23:52.469 --> 03:23:52.479 align:start position:0%
information that there will be things
 
03:23:52.479 --> 03:23:53.190 align:start position:0%
information that there will be things
that

03:23:53.190 --> 03:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
can't be answered but i think it's a um
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
a best
 
03:23:58.160 --> 03:23:59.030 align:start position:0%
a best
best

03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
best
 
03:23:59.040 --> 03:24:00.309 align:start position:0%
best
um

03:24:00.309 --> 03:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
recollection it's it would be the you
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
know what what whatever um records are
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
available i think that's the point i i
 
03:24:09.910 --> 03:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't think any expectation of of you
 
03:24:12.150 --> 03:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
know 30 years ago that people are i
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
think it's that's probably not possible
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
but whatever information there is to be
 
03:24:17.120 --> 03:24:18.150 align:start position:0%
but whatever information there is to be
had

03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
had
 
03:24:20.229 --> 03:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
should be collected
 
03:24:23.190 --> 03:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow follow up
 
03:24:23.200 --> 03:24:23.990 align:start position:0%
follow follow up
so

03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:27.269 --> 03:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
should child be changed to make
 
03:24:29.030 --> 03:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
or if available
 
03:24:32.790 --> 03:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.389 --> 03:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.429 --> 03:24:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
if avail i i don't know i i don't know
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know i'm i'm wondering if
 
03:24:51.510 --> 03:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
there's a way to to you know maybe a
 
03:24:53.190 --> 03:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
men's language that says something to
 
03:24:55.510 --> 03:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
the effect that uh
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know as rec per records or or per
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
perv you know whatever's on site right
 
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
for record keeping that's available to
 
03:25:05.190 --> 03:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the departments um something that so
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's so it's clear that it's just not
 
03:25:12.309 --> 03:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
that there's an acknowledgement of the
 
03:25:15.110 --> 03:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
expectation of the request to report but
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the reporting is not complete
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
due to lack of of available information
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
or or this the um specific information
 
03:25:25.030 --> 03:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay because you understand where i'm
 
03:25:27.190 --> 03:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
going with this with the shell we're
 
03:25:29.429 --> 03:25:29.439 align:start position:0%
asking requiring them to provide
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
something that they may not have built
 
03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
right and right thank you i i would
 
03:25:33.920 --> 03:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
right and right thank you i i would
agree

03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
agree
 
03:25:38.229 --> 03:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody can can can can uh
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
respond to something that they don't
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have access to and i think
 
03:25:45.190 --> 03:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
that the intent is to obtain the
 
03:25:47.590 --> 03:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
information that is available
 
03:25:50.550 --> 03:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
yes ms murphy yeah i have a question
 
03:25:51.750 --> 03:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that you're asking every
 
03:25:56.469 --> 03:25:56.479 align:start position:0%
fire department in the state
 
03:25:59.590 --> 03:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
to research 30 odd years of records to
 
03:26:01.590 --> 03:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
get this information
 
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:10.469 --> 03:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your question um i um
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
the departments would would within
 
03:26:19.510 --> 03:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
however they manage staffing i i expect
 
03:26:21.269 --> 03:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
that it's something that would would
 
03:26:22.710 --> 03:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
would probably
 
03:26:25.510 --> 03:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
require if maybe for a larger department
 
03:26:27.910 --> 03:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh additional staffing support
 
03:26:30.309 --> 03:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
um for initially i don't think it would
 
03:26:32.309 --> 03:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
be anything given given what we know in
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the use that it's not going to
 
03:26:35.429 --> 03:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
be used now
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
this is this is sort of a catch-up
 
03:26:40.309 --> 03:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
time that i don't think ongoing it would
 
03:26:42.309 --> 03:26:42.319 align:start position:0%
be a a um
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
an ongoing expectation of that would
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
require additional staffing um so i i
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know i recognize that it would be
 
03:26:49.760 --> 03:26:51.030 align:start position:0%
you know i recognize that it would be
um

03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
it would require some some uh you know
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
some some
 
03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
manpower for a period of time and you
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
know i think that would be up to the
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
departments i i don't certainly don't
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
have a sense of of the cost
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:15.269 --> 03:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:27:18.710 --> 03:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
ma'am i'm um
 
03:27:23.190 --> 03:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
you've kind of you've kind of hit the
 
03:27:25.349 --> 03:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
harness nest here because i also have 25
 
03:27:27.429 --> 03:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
years in the fire service myself
 
03:27:29.510 --> 03:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i am a
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
fire service historian by hobby and i'm
 
03:27:33.830 --> 03:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
a published author of
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
the historical firefighting book
 
03:27:39.269 --> 03:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
um one of the things
 
03:27:39.279 --> 03:27:40.229 align:start position:0%
um one of the things
that's

03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
massively concerning about this bill
 
03:27:45.830 --> 03:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
and i and i don't know if you you can
 
03:27:47.910 --> 03:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
try to answer this um
 
03:27:49.590 --> 03:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
realistically what you're asking for i'm
 
03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to just tell you right now is
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to be virtually impossible
 
03:27:55.750 --> 03:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
okay because you're not talking about 30
 
03:27:57.110 --> 03:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
years of records you're talking about 60
 
03:27:59.990 --> 03:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
years of records records that were never
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
ever kept or maintained in reference to
 
03:28:07.590 --> 03:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:09.190 --> 03:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
please understand that those of us in
 
03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
the fire service have have a very
 
03:28:14.229 --> 03:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern over pfas and and as
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
you stated it's an emerging
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
it's an emerging thing when it comes to
 
03:28:21.190 --> 03:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
cancer not only in the fire service but
 
03:28:23.429 --> 03:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
but other places
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
you you stated that
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty much everywhere in
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
new hampshire well my question to you is
 
03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
this if it's really kind of everywhere
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and you're looking to
 
03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
conduct testing
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
for specific reasons
 
03:28:40.950 --> 03:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
why bother with the fire service why
 
03:28:42.309 --> 03:28:42.319 align:start position:0%
bother with
 
03:28:43.750 --> 03:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
the places
 
03:28:45.429 --> 03:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
the training areas that we know it's a
 
03:28:45.439 --> 03:28:46.950 align:start position:0%
the training areas that we know it's a
given

03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
given
 
03:28:48.229 --> 03:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
if you're really looking for this why
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
not just conduct the tests that you're
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
going to conduct anyway and cut
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
cut this requirement totally out of it
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your question and thank
 
03:29:01.670 --> 03:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
you for your fire service um i i think
 
03:29:03.830 --> 03:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
it's it it's pretty clear to all of us
 
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:05.680 align:start position:0%
that there is no way that we're going to
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
be able to get information from 30 years
 
03:29:09.830 --> 03:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
ago or 60 years ago i'm sure it doesn't
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
exist i'm sure maybe information from 10
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
years ago might not even exist
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
the point was to get as much information
 
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
as was as was available
 
03:29:19.120 --> 03:29:19.910 align:start position:0%
as was as was available
um

03:29:19.910 --> 03:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:22.870 --> 03:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know the the um the
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
testing we certainly when i when i say
 
03:29:27.190 --> 03:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
it's everywhere we know it will we can
 
03:29:29.269 --> 03:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
expect it in the places that you would
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
agree you know for the fire departments
 
03:29:34.630 --> 03:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
and airports and those kinds of things
 
03:29:34.640 --> 03:29:36.469 align:start position:0%
and airports and those kinds of things
but

03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:29:39.349 --> 03:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
i mean des we know staffing for des is
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
limited resources there are limited as
 
03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
limited resources there are limited as
well

03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
and this would be a tool that would
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
enable them to
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
target the areas that may impact
 
03:29:53.830 --> 03:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:56.710 --> 03:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
drinking water protection or impact the
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
the largest uh population
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
um and you know that would be for them i
 
03:30:03.910 --> 03:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be cool for them to use
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
um to to in their discretion to figure
 
03:30:09.429 --> 03:30:09.439 align:start position:0%
out how they were going to target um you
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
know the different areas of the state uh
 
03:30:14.710 --> 03:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
and and yeah i know the tool that uh the
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
um the survey that came out of uh senate
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
bill 257 was a help i think it gave a
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of a
 
03:30:24.309 --> 03:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
a window into you know where
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
most of the majority of the the um the
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
foam is stored
 
03:30:30.150 --> 03:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
but there's still so much to learn and i
 
03:30:30.160 --> 03:30:30.870 align:start position:0%
but there's still so much to learn and i
think

03:30:30.870 --> 03:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:30:34.389 --> 03:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know i i i agree it's a it's a huge
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
task i i i
 
03:30:39.349 --> 03:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
totally agree and i understand i i
 
03:30:41.269 --> 03:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
fighting in merrimack here for the last
 
03:30:43.349 --> 03:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
five years about
 
03:30:45.910 --> 03:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know six wells so i can imagine
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking six wells with a lot of
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
contamination not with when you have
 
03:30:51.910 --> 03:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
multiple places with multiple uses and
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
records that aren't great um
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
but we have to start somewhere and um i
 
03:30:59.510 --> 03:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
think that that the um
 
03:31:01.830 --> 03:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
this registry allows
 
03:31:05.110 --> 03:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
you know um the state to start someplace
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
so thank you great question
 
03:31:15.190 --> 03:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
keep in mind if you're asking for
 
03:31:16.640 --> 03:31:18.389 align:start position:0%
keep in mind if you're asking for
municipalities

03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
03:31:21.429 --> 03:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
to do the dig
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
you you've just now given us an unfunded
 
03:31:23.359 --> 03:31:25.110 align:start position:0%
you you've just now given us an unfunded
mandate

03:31:25.110 --> 03:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
03:31:28.630 --> 03:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know you're looking at
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
the cities in nashua manchester
 
03:31:33.510 --> 03:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
concord anybody that's got highways
 
03:31:35.990 --> 03:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
airports you're talking about a very big
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
dig here
 
03:31:40.790 --> 03:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
to to try to
 
03:31:44.229 --> 03:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
even begin to look at this um
 
03:31:45.750 --> 03:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know would it wouldn't it make more
 
03:31:47.830 --> 03:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
sense to just draw a line here and say
 
03:31:47.840 --> 03:31:48.630 align:start position:0%
sense to just draw a line here and say
okay

03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:51.910 --> 03:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know starting whatever january july
 
03:31:51.920 --> 03:31:53.110 align:start position:0%
you know starting whatever january july
1

03:31:53.110 --> 03:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
1
 
03:31:54.469 --> 03:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to attract this moving
 
03:31:54.479 --> 03:31:55.910 align:start position:0%
we're going to attract this moving
forward

03:31:55.910 --> 03:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
and not try to
 
03:31:59.429 --> 03:31:59.439 align:start position:0%
have the state ultimately the state
 
03:32:01.269 --> 03:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
would have to fund
 
03:32:03.910 --> 03:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
this look back across new hampshire and
 
03:32:05.830 --> 03:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it just make sense to just
 
03:32:08.950 --> 03:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
draw a line and start forward
 
03:32:11.510 --> 03:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
oh thank you for your question i i agree
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
we have to start someplace and it would
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
be great if we could just start now the
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
problem is is this the impact
 
03:32:20.469 --> 03:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
is where we've already the impact
 
03:32:22.389 --> 03:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
already exists so so
 
03:32:24.550 --> 03:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
so as much as i'd you know it would be a
 
03:32:26.070 --> 03:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
nice clean and easy to say okay from
 
03:32:28.070 --> 03:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
this point on but really from this point
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
on i can't imagine that other than
 
03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
storage that there really would be any
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
use of of
 
03:32:34.950 --> 03:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
of a triple s like so i i i get that it
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
won't be
 
03:32:40.630 --> 03:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
as as much
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
labor intensive or or there would be as
 
03:32:45.750 --> 03:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
much involved in working foe and i and i
 
03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely see the the value of that
 
03:32:51.429 --> 03:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
however the problem is is is we're
 
03:32:54.070 --> 03:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
trying to find out where have we where
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
what areas are already impacted areas
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we might not have that you know
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
might not have been directly next to an
 
03:33:01.590 --> 03:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
airport there might be you know the
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater plumes and and things might
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
have just impacted areas that i know
 
03:33:07.750 --> 03:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
here in merrimack that you know we would
 
03:33:10.229 --> 03:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
not have been expected so
 
03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
03:33:13.429 --> 03:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
certainly understand
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
the desire to move forward i think you
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
know that's certainly a starting place
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
but um in order to
 
03:33:19.920 --> 03:33:22.229 align:start position:0%
but um in order to
to

03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
address the the contamination that is so
 
03:33:26.550 --> 03:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
widespread we need to know where it
 
03:33:28.469 --> 03:33:28.479 align:start position:0%
already is
 
03:33:30.710 --> 03:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
here one more time
 
03:33:33.269 --> 03:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
one more
 
03:33:35.110 --> 03:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
miss murphy you're aware that there are
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal exemptions for certain
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
classifications when it comes to the
 
03:33:41.429 --> 03:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
current use of this foam
 
03:33:42.950 --> 03:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
this this is not something that is
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
completely stopped
 
03:33:44.720 --> 03:33:45.750 align:start position:0%
completely stopped
so

03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
i would hope that at least from that
 
03:33:48.000 --> 03:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
i would hope that at least from that
point

03:33:49.190 --> 03:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:33:51.830 --> 03:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
you would be admittable to to
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
considering the fact that it's it is not
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
all gone away
 
03:33:58.229 --> 03:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that doing a look from a line
 
03:33:58.239 --> 03:34:00.070 align:start position:0%
and that doing a look from a line
forward

03:34:00.070 --> 03:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your question
 
03:34:09.750 --> 03:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's always value and and you
 
03:34:11.670 --> 03:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
know anything we know any data that we
 
03:34:13.269 --> 03:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
have is valuable
 
03:34:15.190 --> 03:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
um you know but i from you know my
 
03:34:17.510 --> 03:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
understanding and i'm certainly not
 
03:34:20.389 --> 03:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
um an expert on all of the regulations
 
03:34:22.550 --> 03:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
but i i do know that there were some
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
changes and and that at from
 
03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
2020 on that um
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
the use was the the um class b with uh
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
with pfas were not going to be used as
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
they have in the past that there were
 
03:34:40.870 --> 03:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
non-fluorine alternatives
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
um so it was my understanding that that
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
was going to be
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
more of a um
 
03:34:48.950 --> 03:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
the intent was to try to to sort of
 
03:34:51.110 --> 03:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
limit the pfest exposure in the
 
03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:53.429 align:start position:0%
limit the pfest exposure in the
environment

03:34:53.429 --> 03:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
environment
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr ms murphy are there any
 
03:34:58.950 --> 03:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:05.429 --> 03:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
i like to call uh

03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
just unmute yourself
 
03:35:19.590 --> 03:35:19.600 align:start position:0%

reside in rindge new hampshire
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's own history with 3m the

one-time manufacturer of class b a
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
triple f
 
03:35:57.349 --> 03:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
is notably not in favor of new hampshire
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
residents as 3m fights new hampshire for
 
03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
its precautions and intentions
 
03:36:05.429 --> 03:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
and its ability to protect its own
 
03:36:07.670 --> 03:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
citizens in order to maintain their
 
03:36:10.630 --> 03:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
control of the scope of the pfas problem
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a leader in firefighter
 
03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
pfas exposure initiatives and has the
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
strongest delegation of congressionals
 
03:36:21.750 --> 03:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we've ever had the pleasure to work
 
03:36:21.760 --> 03:36:22.710 align:start position:0%
that we've ever had the pleasure to work
with

03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:36:25.349 --> 03:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
when it comes to firefighters and pfas
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
used in their a triple f and in the most
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
highly fluorinated textiles seen by
 
03:36:33.830 --> 03:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
science that is their turnout gear
 
03:36:35.910 --> 03:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
the long overdue need to track and
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
register a toxic a triple f outweighs in
 
03:36:43.269 --> 03:36:43.279 align:start position:0%
any potential opposition to the aspect
 
03:36:45.670 --> 03:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
of the job of a firefighter
 
03:36:48.309 --> 03:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
these are toxic exposures and no
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
different than any other chemical
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
exposure that must be reported as part
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the daily work by officers of the
 
03:36:57.990 --> 03:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
departments that serve their communities
 
03:37:00.950 --> 03:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
as the firefighter pfas exposure
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
experience grows one of the areas that
 
03:37:05.349 --> 03:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
will benefit the citizens of new
 
03:37:08.790 --> 03:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire is to log these exposures this
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
is done on a daily basis all over the
 
03:37:13.750 --> 03:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
country when responding to an incident
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
and there are numerous free apps and as
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
advocates for this issue we can't stress
 
03:37:21.349 --> 03:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
strongly enough how important it is that
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters protect themselves and
 
03:37:25.750 --> 03:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
their families by logging their
 
03:37:25.760 --> 03:37:27.269 align:start position:0%
their families by logging their
exposures

03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
exposures
 
03:37:29.910 --> 03:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
the same goes from our municipalities
 
03:37:32.469 --> 03:37:32.479 align:start position:0%
who are paying the cost of firefighters
 
03:37:34.870 --> 03:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
stricken with cancers that are known to
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
be affiliated with the pfas chemicals
 
03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
in our work we speak with firefighters
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
who must try to recall their own a
 
03:37:45.910 --> 03:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
triple f use that they file as they file
 
03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
for claims for compensation
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
and are saddled with trying to recall
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
what incident they used class b foam at
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
going back decades in their careers as
 
03:37:59.429 --> 03:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
their cancers are now prevalent in their
 
03:37:59.439 --> 03:38:00.870 align:start position:0%
their cancers are now prevalent in their
bodies

03:38:00.870 --> 03:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
if you have no records to show of
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
exposures to these carcinogens you may
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
not have the ability to protect the
 
03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
citizens who may wish to claim damages
 
03:38:13.190 --> 03:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
from deniers with endless amounts of
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
money in their coffers who scoff at the
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
thought that their chemicals are harmful
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
a triple f manufacturers have a long
 
03:38:24.870 --> 03:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
history of awarding perks and incentives
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the form of gifts trips and dinners
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
to firefighters in an effort to keep
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
them close this has led to a false sense
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
of protection within the fire service
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
this is magnified by the fact that the
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
makers of class b phone belong to the
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
firefighting film coalition who provides
 
03:38:46.229 --> 03:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
junk science to the fire service for
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
them to swallow excuse me ms ms cotter
 
03:38:51.670 --> 03:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
could you please confine your testimony
 
03:38:55.429 --> 03:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
to this bill we're not debating what the
 
03:38:57.670 --> 03:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
evils of pfas
 
03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
we're debating whether we should create
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
a registry
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes new hampshire des was first in the
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
nation in 2017 to advise firefighters to
 
03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
test the well water in their firehouses
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
and has written strong language that
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
showcases the concern new hampshire has
 
03:39:18.309 --> 03:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
for its firefighters
 
03:39:20.790 --> 03:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
we see no reason for new hampshire des
 
03:39:23.349 --> 03:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
to not continue as a leader in the role
 
03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
of initiating this a triple f registry
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
for its bravest and its citizens who are
 
03:39:31.110 --> 03:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
living in fear of unknown toxic
 
03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
exposures in a day and age when
 
03:39:36.550 --> 03:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
electronic data is collected sent and
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
stored in milliseconds we express our
 
03:39:41.910 --> 03:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
gratitude to the representatives who
 
03:39:43.670 --> 03:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
have drafted this bill
 
03:39:45.269 --> 03:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:46.630 --> 03:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there questions for ms

thank you are there questions for ms

seeing none thank you very much
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call mr mike wimpsap from
 
03:39:55.840 --> 03:39:58.950 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call mr mike wimpsap from

03:39:58.950 --> 03:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon madam chair uh for
 
03:40:03.190 --> 03:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
the record my name is mike winsat
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
service director of the waste management
 
03:40:05.910 --> 03:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
division for the new hampshire
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
03:40:09.590 --> 03:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
03:40:11.190 --> 03:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
03:40:13.830 --> 03:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
on house bill 141 today
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
des does support this bill
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
and especially the intent of trying to
 
03:40:21.190 --> 03:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
provide additional reporting so that we
 
03:40:23.830 --> 03:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
have a better understanding of where
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
pfas containing foams may have been
 
03:40:29.269 --> 03:40:29.279 align:start position:0%
either stored managed or disposed of or
 
03:40:29.279 --> 03:40:30.870 align:start position:0%
either stored managed or disposed of or
used

03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
used
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
we do have some concerns regarding uh
 
03:40:36.070 --> 03:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
two two items on the bill the first is a
 
03:40:38.630 --> 03:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
kind of a technical one and i think uh
 
03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative goalie may have gone
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
to this with his questioning and that is
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we have um
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
the bill currently would require des to
 
03:40:50.070 --> 03:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
go through rule making to provide the
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
forms and the and the structure for this
 
03:40:54.870 --> 03:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
reporting by fire departments
 
03:40:57.910 --> 03:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
and um then it also requires that the
 
03:41:00.389 --> 03:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
reporting begin 120 days after the
 
03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
effective date of the bill
 
03:41:03.750 --> 03:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we're a little concerned that that
 
03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
may not provide enough time
 
03:41:08.229 --> 03:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
for the agency to develop the forms go
 
03:41:10.469 --> 03:41:10.479 align:start position:0%
through the formal rulemaking process
 
03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
advertise that to the folks who would be
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
reporting and then give them time to do
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
the reporting that's necessary so we
 
03:41:18.870 --> 03:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
might suggest an amendment that might
 
03:41:21.510 --> 03:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
extend that time out to 180 days or
 
03:41:22.950 --> 03:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
whatever the committee might feel is
 
03:41:24.870 --> 03:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate um
 
03:41:27.190 --> 03:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
and and these the second issue is one
 
03:41:28.309 --> 03:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's unfortunately one that
 
03:41:29.830 --> 03:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
comes up with a lot of bills where we
 
03:41:31.750 --> 03:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
where we support the intent
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
but uh we did provide a fiscal note
 
03:41:35.670 --> 03:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
worksheet on this bill when it was sent
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
to us for when a request was sent by lba
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
and uh we did indicate that would
 
03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
probably take on the order of about an
 
03:41:44.389 --> 03:41:44.399 align:start position:0%
additional half of a full-time
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
equivalent position to it to to
 
03:41:46.720 --> 03:41:47.830 align:start position:0%
equivalent position to it to to
structure

03:41:47.830 --> 03:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
set up and
 
03:41:51.990 --> 03:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
administer this program and we do note
 
03:41:53.190 --> 03:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
that the bill doesn't make any
 
03:41:54.870 --> 03:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation for
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
for that for for that kind of personnel
 
03:42:00.389 --> 03:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
so we just want to register that concern
 
03:42:02.710 --> 03:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh but beyond that again we we think a
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
public registry will help inform the
 
03:42:06.389 --> 03:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
public this is a topic of very high
 
03:42:06.399 --> 03:42:07.269 align:start position:0%
public this is a topic of very high
interest

03:42:07.269 --> 03:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:42:09.910 --> 03:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a number of examples where
 
03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
the use or release of pfas containing
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
class b foams have impacted drinking
 
03:42:17.590 --> 03:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
water in our communities and so we think
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
that this will help advance our efforts
 
03:42:21.269 --> 03:42:21.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that everybody has safe clean
 
03:42:23.110 --> 03:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
drinking water and with that i'll be
 
03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:42:28.870 --> 03:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
from the committee for mr williamson
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
representative just have one on the
 
03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
website i know that you're an expert in
 
03:42:36.229 --> 03:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
this but is it uh
 
03:42:38.790 --> 03:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
did i hear that the uh while this is
 
03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:40.150 align:start position:0%
did i hear that the uh while this is
meritorious

03:42:40.150 --> 03:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
meritorious
 
03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:41.510 align:start position:0%
meritorious
that

03:42:41.510 --> 03:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:42:44.229 --> 03:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
new firms have been developed where this
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
problem will be like lead paint and
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
eventually go away
 
03:42:50.150 --> 03:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative scitec actually um i'm
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly where things are at i
 
03:42:56.229 --> 03:42:56.239 align:start position:0%
have had conversations with industry
 
03:42:58.389 --> 03:42:58.399 align:start position:0%
folks over the last couple of years i
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
know they are working hard to develop a
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
class b foam
 
03:43:03.750 --> 03:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
that is as effective
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
and there are some phase outs for the
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
use of class b foams
 
03:43:10.229 --> 03:43:10.239 align:start position:0%
this is a very specialized foam that is
 
03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
intended to be used for flammable liquid
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
fires and so of course the hazards
 
03:43:15.990 --> 03:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
associated with those fires are very
 
03:43:18.309 --> 03:43:18.319 align:start position:0%
very high not just from a fire but an
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
explosion that can occur as a result of
 
03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
vapors coming off of the of the heated
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh flammable liquid and so uh you know
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
these are required at airports
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
and they are still used
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
where a
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
flammable liquid is is a concern at a
 
03:43:35.510 --> 03:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
fire so
 
03:43:37.590 --> 03:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that my understanding the
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
last time i spoke with industry
 
03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
representatives is that they are working
 
03:43:42.710 --> 03:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
on this but they have not yet developed
 
03:43:45.910 --> 03:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
a class b foam that is pfas free
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
that works as effectively as these uh
 
03:43:50.630 --> 03:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
class b forms now it's important to
 
03:43:52.710 --> 03:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
understand that the class b foams that
 
03:43:54.229 --> 03:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
are in use now
 
03:43:56.469 --> 03:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
do have pfas although they do not
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
contain they've been reformulated so
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
that the pfas compounds that they
 
03:44:00.479 --> 03:44:02.229 align:start position:0%
that the pfas compounds that they
contain

03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
contain
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
do not include some of the
 
03:44:05.910 --> 03:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
more troublesome
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
pfas compounds that we're concerned
 
03:44:09.110 --> 03:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
about so
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
pfos for example which is for
 
03:44:13.429 --> 03:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
fluoroctane sulfonate which is a primary
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
component of these early what we call
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
legacy foams um that that that that as a
 
03:44:21.429 --> 03:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
component of these foams has been phased
 
03:44:22.469 --> 03:44:22.479 align:start position:0%
out so
 
03:44:23.910 --> 03:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
if you will there's still pfas
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
containing foams we still have concerned
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
about the con the contents of the foams
 
03:44:30.469 --> 03:44:30.479 align:start position:0%
but they are not as troublesome as say a
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
foam that was used 10 or 15 years ago
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:44:40.229 --> 03:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:44.550 --> 03:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
so the
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
des is estimated that the if i heard you
 
03:44:52.150 --> 03:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
write half person staff
 
03:44:54.550 --> 03:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the entire state of new hampshire
 
03:44:54.560 --> 03:44:55.990 align:start position:0%
for the entire state of new hampshire
for

03:44:55.990 --> 03:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
all of the municipalities that have used
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
this in it in the city of manchester
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
alone at least 5 000 locations that can
 
03:45:06.630 --> 03:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
that could probably be argued or this
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
might have happened either in user and
 
03:45:10.150 --> 03:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
training how on earth did you come up
 
03:45:10.160 --> 03:45:10.870 align:start position:0%
training how on earth did you come up
with

03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:45:13.550 --> 03:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
the number of half a person
 
03:45:13.560 --> 03:45:14.870 align:start position:0%
the number of half a person

03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question representative
 
03:45:18.630 --> 03:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
pearson um and i do want to emphasize we
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
don't have any half persons working at
 
03:45:25.030 --> 03:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:27.429 --> 03:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
we calculate calculate the amount of
 
03:45:27.439 --> 03:45:28.630 align:start position:0%
we calculate calculate the amount of
time

03:45:28.630 --> 03:45:28.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
that someone will have to work on
 
03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
something um in fractions because
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
obviously a particular assignment
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily take an entire
 
03:45:38.469 --> 03:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
position it's full time when we look at
 
03:45:40.870 --> 03:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
this it will clearly be very front
 
03:45:42.870 --> 03:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
loaded with work in terms of developing
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
the reporting system
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
getting that system through the rule
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
making process in the appropriate forms
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:45:53.269 --> 03:45:53.279 align:start position:0%
doing any uh you know perhaps
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
i t department to develop a system for
 
03:45:57.269 --> 03:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
managing database for managing that
 
03:45:57.279 --> 03:45:58.469 align:start position:0%
managing database for managing that
information

03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
and then collecting the information that
 
03:46:01.990 --> 03:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
will come in and so in the very
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
beginning it might well be more than
 
03:46:05.510 --> 03:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
that but as we were trying to be
 
03:46:07.429 --> 03:46:07.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable as we calculated out over
 
03:46:07.439 --> 03:46:08.469 align:start position:0%
reasonable as we calculated out over
time

03:46:08.469 --> 03:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:46:11.110 --> 03:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
after those initial reports come in our
 
03:46:13.429 --> 03:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
expectation would be that the intensity
 
03:46:15.670 --> 03:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
and frequency of reporting would be a
 
03:46:18.469 --> 03:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
lot less um so you know it's it's always
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
an inexact science trying to calculate
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
these things but we our best estimates
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
were that an equivalent of a half of a
 
03:46:27.030 --> 03:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
position would be required to
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
stand up implement and then uh over time
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
manage this program
 
03:46:33.510 --> 03:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
hold on manager
 
03:46:33.520 --> 03:46:35.590 align:start position:0%
hold on manager
follow

03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:46:36.389 --> 03:46:36.399 align:start position:0%
so the up
 
03:46:38.150 --> 03:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
that was made was based on the fact that
 
03:46:41.189 --> 03:46:41.199 align:start position:0%
the municipalities will be expending
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh manpower and time to conduct these
 
03:46:49.750 --> 03:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
surveys and not the des is that correct
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the information that is
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
required for those municipalities to
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
report it would be their job to to to
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
compile that information um to go to
 
03:47:00.870 --> 03:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
your earlier question if i may
 
03:47:01.990 --> 03:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know it's we have a lot of
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
requirements that sometimes ask for
 
03:47:05.590 --> 03:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
information that just simply isn't
 
03:47:08.550 --> 03:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
available and so if a as long as the
 
03:47:10.950 --> 03:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
municipality made a good faith effort to
 
03:47:13.429 --> 03:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
collect what information they had if
 
03:47:15.910 --> 03:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
their reporting was not complete respect
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
to volumes or specific dates but they
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
provided the information they had
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
available i i think we would not see
 
03:47:24.950 --> 03:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
that as a compliance issue we would
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
obviously be we would understand that
 
03:47:28.950 --> 03:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know just because you write down a
 
03:47:28.960 --> 03:47:31.110 align:start position:0%
you know just because you write down a
requirement

03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:47:33.510 --> 03:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
for something that happened in the past
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
you can't necessarily expect the party
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
to have all of that information
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes and representative pearson there is
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
also no money
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
in that estimate for
 
03:47:46.550 --> 03:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
the effort the towns the cities probably
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
would expend researching their records
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:56.710 --> 03:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you have a
 
03:47:56.720 --> 03:48:00.389 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you have a
question

03:48:00.389 --> 03:48:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just to inject
 
03:48:05.910 --> 03:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh a a a
 
03:48:07.990 --> 03:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
potentially interesting fact
 
03:48:11.110 --> 03:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
into the discussion uh i'm sure madam
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
chair you'll recall
 
03:48:14.469 --> 03:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
and some of the senior members of the
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee will recall that roughly
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
three to four years ago we had a bill
 
03:48:22.630 --> 03:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
with regard to firefighting foams
 
03:48:25.429 --> 03:48:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh and so my question for mr wimsat is
 
03:48:25.439 --> 03:48:27.110 align:start position:0%
uh and so my question for mr wimsat is
whether

03:48:27.110 --> 03:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:48:30.229 --> 03:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
he recalls or he of his own knowledge
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
whether uh he participated in uh the
 
03:48:36.150 --> 03:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh deliberations we had a
 
03:48:39.910 --> 03:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh and we examined this
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
whole complex of
 
03:48:46.229 --> 03:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
the existing firefighting foams and and
 
03:48:46.239 --> 03:48:48.309 align:start position:0%
the existing firefighting foams and and
what

03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:48:49.830 --> 03:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
improving them removing the more toxic
 
03:48:55.510 --> 03:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
and dangerous chemicals from them was
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so forth uh so
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm just injecting that because mr
 
03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
wimsat may have been involved in in that
 
03:49:05.830 --> 03:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
in that process and that information
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to to the committee
 
03:49:13.590 --> 03:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt yes i
 
03:49:18.150 --> 03:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
have participated um in testifying on
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
other bills and also on sub committees
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
that have worked on issues related to
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
this firefighting question and as uh
 
03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
ms murphy indicated earlier we have
 
03:49:30.630 --> 03:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
issued a report based on the the we work
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
very closely with the fire marshal's
 
03:49:33.990 --> 03:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
office to reach out to
 
03:49:36.150 --> 03:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh the firefighting companies in the in
 
03:49:39.110 --> 03:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
the state to get information about their
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
stocks of pfas foams because we were
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
working on a program for for taking back
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
those legacy foams the older foams that
 
03:49:48.150 --> 03:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
i mentioned that have higher
 
03:49:50.550 --> 03:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
concentrations of more concerning pfas
 
03:49:53.110 --> 03:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
compounds so we have made some progress
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
on that and we've also worked on a
 
03:49:56.309 --> 03:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
number of sites where drinking water has
 
03:49:58.950 --> 03:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
been impacted by the use of these foams
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
or the disposal of these foams so we're
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
learning more each day but we we still
 
03:50:05.030 --> 03:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
have a lot more to learn
 
03:50:07.269 --> 03:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
right i think that whatever was produced
 
03:50:09.510 --> 03:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
with regard to that particular bill and
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
those stu and that study committee uh
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
report would be useful in in this topic
 
03:50:17.750 --> 03:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
in any case
 
03:50:20.229 --> 03:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows thank
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um mr wim said do you
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
know if any other states collect this
 
03:50:30.150 --> 03:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:31.510 --> 03:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows that's
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
a good question i i don't know
 
03:50:35.590 --> 03:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
specifically any states that have
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
actually you know established laws for
 
03:50:39.269 --> 03:50:39.279 align:start position:0%
the collection of this information i
 
03:50:41.349 --> 03:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
know that a number of other states are
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
very aware of this problem and have been
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
working on many fronts to collect
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
information about how and where
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
not just class b firefighting foams but
 
03:50:50.080 --> 03:50:50.870 align:start position:0%
not just class b firefighting foams but
other

03:50:50.870 --> 03:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:50:53.429 --> 03:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
materials that contain pfas have been
 
03:50:55.830 --> 03:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
used and disposed of because
 
03:50:57.349 --> 03:50:57.359 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately as we've learned
 
03:50:59.030 --> 03:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
more about this over the last five years
 
03:51:00.550 --> 03:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
or so
 
03:51:02.469 --> 03:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
fast contamination exists in a lot of
 
03:51:05.030 --> 03:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
places and it's impacted a number of
 
03:51:06.790 --> 03:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
both public and private drinking water
 
03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:13.269 align:start position:0%
both public and private drinking water
systems

03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for mr
 
03:51:14.880 --> 03:51:19.349 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for mr
wilmset

03:51:19.349 --> 03:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
03:51:24.309 --> 03:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
03:51:30.630 --> 03:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:36.070 --> 03:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.910 --> 03:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.389 --> 03:51:43.399 align:start position:0%
hi there i just wanted to say um that in
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
2008 minnesota did do an extensive
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
survey it's called the delta project and
 
03:51:54.550 --> 03:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
i i did send it along along with my
 
03:51:56.550 --> 03:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
03:51:58.469 --> 03:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
that you folks should have
 
03:52:01.429 --> 03:52:01.439 align:start position:0%
and it really gives a great
 
03:52:03.910 --> 03:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
review of the questions that were asked
 
03:52:06.870 --> 03:52:06.880 align:start position:0%
to the fire services and their responses
 
03:52:09.429 --> 03:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
of what they knew it might be something
 
03:52:09.439 --> 03:52:10.469 align:start position:0%
of what they knew it might be something
that

03:52:10.469 --> 03:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
that mike may want to take a look at for
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire des as well
 
03:52:16.000 --> 03:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
new hampshire des as well
um

03:52:16.870 --> 03:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
and also in i also included it as well
 
03:52:23.429 --> 03:52:23.439 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony was the state of
 
03:52:27.990 --> 03:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
michigan that also did a survey um and i
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
think they worked with their new
 
03:52:32.309 --> 03:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire ge i'm sorry they're michigan
 
03:52:36.150 --> 03:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
des in regards to uh surveying their
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
fire uh fire services so you can see
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
their response as well they actually
 
03:52:45.429 --> 03:52:45.439 align:start position:0%
went on record to um put all 1400 fire
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
stations on their
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
potential pfas contamination sites so
 
03:52:52.469 --> 03:52:52.479 align:start position:0%
but there's some great material in there
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you want folks want to take a look at
 
03:52:54.000 --> 03:53:06.389 align:start position:0%
if you want folks want to take a look at
that

03:53:06.389 --> 03:53:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:06.399 --> 03:53:12.630 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:12.640 --> 03:53:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:53:26.150 --> 03:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:28.309 --> 03:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
call it to the committee's attention as
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
well that our former committee member
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
former representative mark prue a former
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
firefighter as well
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
it was on the committee and was involved
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill that i referenced in my
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
earlier remarks
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
and he's somebody that the committee
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
might want to contact with regard to
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
his expertise on the subject because
 
03:53:57.189 --> 03:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
i believe he's engaged in some
 
03:53:57.199 --> 03:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
i believe he's engaged in some
training

03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
training
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
activities currently
 
03:54:03.670 --> 03:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
and he might well have information with
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:12.560 --> 03:54:13.389 align:start position:0%
 
there

03:54:13.389 --> 03:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:54:28.290 --> 03:54:28.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:28.300 --> 03:54:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:54:33.670 --> 03:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
all right well um
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
while we're here does anyone have a
 
03:54:44.410 --> 03:54:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:44.420 --> 03:54:55.429 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.269 --> 03:55:01.279 align:start position:0%
yes i was
 
03:55:08.630 --> 03:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.910 --> 03:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:17.110 --> 03:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
i i
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
will move
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
in expedia at the legislature
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'll second
 
03:55:24.319 --> 03:55:25.590 align:start position:0%
i'll second
well

03:55:25.590 --> 03:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm chair if i may is
 
03:55:29.990 --> 03:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative schumann i thought had a
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
known do you have an amendment on this
 
03:55:35.030 --> 03:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's what i was going to say
 
03:55:37.269 --> 03:55:37.279 align:start position:0%
if we kill this bill
 
03:55:39.590 --> 03:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh can we
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
proceed with
 
03:55:43.349 --> 03:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
the hearing on the non-germain amendment
 
03:55:45.189 --> 03:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
next monday
 
03:55:46.150 --> 03:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
we would
 
03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
well actually you're right we should
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
probably not actually vote itl but i
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
think we should discuss it from that
 
03:55:52.640 --> 03:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
think we should discuss it from that
standpoint

03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you then we will recess
 
03:55:58.630 --> 03:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
before the vote
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
send goalie your comments
 
03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
03:56:04.389 --> 03:56:04.399 align:start position:0%
that this
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
is an
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
unworkable um
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
solution i mean working for
 
03:56:14.070 --> 03:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
city of manchester and
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
like representative o'brien said being
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
from nashua uh knowing the number of
 
03:56:20.150 --> 03:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
calls we do a year and going back and
 
03:56:22.389 --> 03:56:22.399 align:start position:0%
searching and researching records over
 
03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
numerous years um is going to be at an
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
expense and
 
03:56:29.910 --> 03:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think finding all of these locations
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
and recording them is going to be um
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
almost impossible
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
i'm surprised that some of the local
 
03:56:39.189 --> 03:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
departments aren't here to talk about
 
03:56:39.199 --> 03:56:40.309 align:start position:0%
departments aren't here to talk about
that

03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:42.710 --> 03:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
because i think it will be
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
time consuming
 
03:56:48.630 --> 03:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
and probably not even
 
03:56:50.710 --> 03:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
being able to get it done i mean i could
 
03:56:53.349 --> 03:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
see going from here on out going forward
 
03:56:55.510 --> 03:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
but backtracking i don't think
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh is a reality so that's why i go along
 
03:56:59.590 --> 03:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
with this
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
that's what i seconded it because i
 
03:57:03.189 --> 03:57:03.199 align:start position:0%
believe it's a
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh downshifting to municipalities of the
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
of the difficulty of tracking
 
03:57:12.790 --> 03:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
decades of use and trying to report it
 
03:57:15.110 --> 03:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
in 120 days
 
03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
and with no funding for the
 
03:57:16.479 --> 03:57:20.229 align:start position:0%
and with no funding for the
municipalities

03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
scitec yeah uh
 
03:57:23.429 --> 03:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
to whom this question maybe to the
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor i'm
 
03:57:26.560 --> 03:57:27.910 align:start position:0%
sponsor i'm
representative

03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're there so i'm not really asking
 
03:57:30.080 --> 03:57:30.790 align:start position:0%
you're there so i'm not really asking
you

03:57:30.790 --> 03:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
but what i'm thinking about the business
 
03:57:37.910 --> 03:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
end of this is the drinking water supply
 
03:57:40.389 --> 03:57:40.399 align:start position:0%
you build a house or you're checking the
 
03:57:40.399 --> 03:57:41.910 align:start position:0%
you build a house or you're checking the
municipal

03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
water or
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
my the condo association i'm in in
 
03:57:45.520 --> 03:57:47.110 align:start position:0%
my the condo association i'm in in
londonderry

03:57:47.110 --> 03:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
londonderry
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
and they've got to lower
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
what difference does it make what's in
 
03:57:53.429 --> 03:57:53.439 align:start position:0%
the ground it's what you're coming out
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
of your pipe and what you have to do to
 
03:57:59.429 --> 03:57:59.439 align:start position:0%
treat your water to get it down to
 
03:58:03.030 --> 03:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
the size like whatever
 
03:58:06.070 --> 03:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
you know going forward sounds not a bad
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
idea i suppose but
 
03:58:12.550 --> 03:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
jeff i don't mean to be looking at you
 
03:58:12.560 --> 03:58:13.590 align:start position:0%
jeff i don't mean to be looking at you
um

03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:15.189 --> 03:58:15.199 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to put you on the spot i'm
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
03:58:19.590 --> 03:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter
 
03:58:22.150 --> 03:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
does it matter i have to purify my water
 
03:58:23.990 --> 03:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter what the survey says
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
or what was there it might affect me as
 
03:58:29.429 --> 03:58:29.439 align:start position:0%
a builder whether i wanted to drill a
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
well there or not i'm talking too much
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is what good does it actually
 
03:58:34.720 --> 03:58:36.229 align:start position:0%
my concern is what good does it actually
do

03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:58:38.229 --> 03:58:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
03:58:42.150 --> 03:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.590 --> 03:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:58:46.469 --> 03:58:46.479 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
as i as i stated earlier you know fire
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
service history is is a substantial
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
hobby of mine and i probably
 
03:58:55.910 --> 03:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
knowing that knowing the players that
 
03:58:57.269 --> 03:58:57.279 align:start position:0%
circle in that world in new hampshire
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to tell you that probably
 
03:59:00.389 --> 03:59:00.399 align:start position:0%
without exception i i have more
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
historical fire service documents than
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
just about anybody
 
03:59:06.469 --> 03:59:06.479 align:start position:0%
my numbers for the city of manchester
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:11.670 --> 03:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to tell you that what is
 
03:59:14.790 --> 03:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
being asked here is not possible it's
 
03:59:17.349 --> 03:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
just not possible so i appreciate the
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
intent i appreciate the concern i i
 
03:59:22.070 --> 03:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
certainly share the concerns of
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the member of the public whose
 
03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
husband is a retired worcester
 
03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
lieutenant and you know this is an issue
 
03:59:29.670 --> 03:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
that the fire service does truly care
 
03:59:29.680 --> 03:59:31.269 align:start position:0%
that the fire service does truly care
about

03:59:31.269 --> 03:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
but we're not we're not debating that
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
we're debating house bill 141 and 141 i
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
i just you know sometimes i look at this
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
and go okay maybe is there a way this
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
could be tweaked to make it workable or
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i gotta tell you i've been racking
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
my brain about it and it just isn't it's
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
just not there
 
03:59:51.429 --> 03:59:51.439 align:start position:0%
it in and i appreciate i'm sure what you
 
03:59:53.269 --> 03:59:53.279 align:start position:0%
said as far as the downshifting of costs
 
03:59:53.279 --> 03:59:54.389 align:start position:0%
said as far as the downshifting of costs
it's

03:59:54.389 --> 03:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:59:56.309 --> 03:59:56.319 align:start position:0%
clearly that that's the avenue to which
 
03:59:58.309 --> 03:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
they think this is going going to work
 
03:59:58.319 --> 03:59:59.110 align:start position:0%
they think this is going going to work
so

03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:01.110 --> 04:00:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know between between the downshift
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
costs and the impossibility
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
of of any fire department coming up with
 
04:00:08.469 --> 04:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
the the information they're looking for
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
um a few things one is um
 
04:00:19.030 --> 04:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
the section statute that this repeals
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
and reenacts
 
04:00:22.870 --> 04:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
already requires reporting the use of
 
04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
the firefighting phone with pfas going
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
forward so that's already in statute
 
04:00:31.030 --> 04:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i just did a little poking around and
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
a comment from representative pearson
 
04:00:33.120 --> 04:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
a comment from representative pearson
there

04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
class b firefighting foams that
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
do not contain pfast they may not work
 
04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
quite as well i'm sure they'll be
 
04:00:42.790 --> 04:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing development
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
and at some point i imagine
 
04:00:45.990 --> 04:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
firefighting foam without p with pfas
 
04:00:50.150 --> 04:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
won't be used but this bill would
 
04:00:52.229 --> 04:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
require ongoing reporting of the use of
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
any class b firefighting foam
 
04:00:57.030 --> 04:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh well maybe that could be fixed
 
04:00:58.710 --> 04:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
given the other concerns i think we need
 
04:01:02.150 --> 04:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:04.710 --> 04:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative harassing
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairperson um having been a
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
town planner for 20 years
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
i have some experience in
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
particularly locating developments but i
 
04:01:14.389 --> 04:01:14.399 align:start position:0%
think that
 
04:01:15.990 --> 04:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:01:17.590 --> 04:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is maybe something you want to
 
04:01:19.030 --> 04:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
retain because
 
04:01:20.550 --> 04:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion about just
 
04:01:21.910 --> 04:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
dropping in a well and you're concerned
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
about not what's in the ground but what
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
comes out of your tap and of course
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's important but what comes out of
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
the ground and what's on the ground in
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
it can be very important when you locate
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
a development or locate homes you don't
 
04:01:37.269 --> 04:01:37.279 align:start position:0%
want to actually build start developing
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
an area that may have some contaminants
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
on it this would help identify areas
 
04:01:44.150 --> 04:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
that you could maybe clean up prior to
 
04:01:46.150 --> 04:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
the development of a project at least
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know what your costs are going to be
 
04:01:49.510 --> 04:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
before you start investing
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of work in the development of the
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
project i would hate to see a developer
 
04:01:54.309 --> 04:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
go in
 
04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
and want to do a site where there may
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
have been some fire testing 10 years
 
04:01:59.349 --> 04:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
previously i certainly understand the
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
problem of the record-keeping and the
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
data that's out there but if it's at all
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
possible i think des did say this during
 
04:02:05.439 --> 04:02:06.870 align:start position:0%
possible i think des did say this during
the

04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
discussion was that they understand that
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's some places the information is
 
04:02:13.349 --> 04:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
just not going to be available another
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
thing i have as well a concern that i
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
would have as well is that when you have
 
04:02:18.469 --> 04:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
business or industries that are located
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
in an area and there is a contamination
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
that occurs or is found in that area
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
they may originally point the finger at
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
that industry or that business even
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
though they may not have nothing to do
 
04:02:29.520 --> 04:02:30.630 align:start position:0%
though they may not have nothing to do
with

04:02:30.630 --> 04:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
somebody may say well there may have
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
been an illegal dumping of pfas if you
 
04:02:36.550 --> 04:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
can show that there's a disbursement of
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
fire retardants at that time that were
 
04:02:38.640 --> 04:02:39.750 align:start position:0%
fire retardants at that time that were
pfas

04:02:39.750 --> 04:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
then they could say it's not us it was a
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
test of the fire department so don't put
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
the liability on the business and this
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
would be another way to prove that
 
04:02:49.990 --> 04:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the business could use to defend itself
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
against an accusation that they were
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
contaminating the ground
 
04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i think that i think it would be
 
04:02:57.189 --> 04:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
better for the community to retain it
 
04:02:59.830 --> 04:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
rather than to itl it so that you can
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and look at these
 
04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
things and maybe put them exemptions in
 
04:03:05.030 --> 04:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
there uh that would
 
04:03:05.040 --> 04:03:05.910 align:start position:0%
there uh that would
cover

04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
cover
 
04:03:08.469 --> 04:03:08.479 align:start position:0%
the problems that you would have with
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
eric gathering all the information we
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
should at least try
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair first i would
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
like to answer rob
 
04:03:25.990 --> 04:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
i think it was representative lakers uh
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
but being on a
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
the fire department for 35 years having
 
04:03:33.510 --> 04:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
worked at the nashua airport uh airport
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
fire certified
 
04:03:38.229 --> 04:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we did use an awful lot of foam
 
04:03:38.239 --> 04:03:39.349 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we did use an awful lot of foam
uh

04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
this particular foam that you're talking
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
about yes there are other protein based
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
foams that you can use on class b
 
04:03:49.990 --> 04:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
flammable liquid fires that aren't as
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
harmful some of them the old ones used
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
to be made out of fish cuts they stunk
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
like hell but they did the trick
 
04:04:02.550 --> 04:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
the thing is with this one in particular
 
04:04:02.560 --> 04:04:03.590 align:start position:0%
the thing is with this one in particular
is

04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:07.349 --> 04:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
again it's still in use as far as i know
 
04:04:07.359 --> 04:04:08.309 align:start position:0%
again it's still in use as far as i know
it's

04:04:08.309 --> 04:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:04:10.150 --> 04:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
the hazards materials that fire
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
departments have to deal with today it's
 
04:04:15.429 --> 04:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
today's modern society that is inviting
 
04:04:18.070 --> 04:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
more type of products into their lives
 
04:04:18.080 --> 04:04:18.950 align:start position:0%
more type of products into their lives
that

04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:04:20.790 --> 04:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
where used to be natural type of
 
04:04:22.950 --> 04:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
products so therefore what this
 
04:04:25.269 --> 04:04:25.279 align:start position:0%
particular foam does
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
it could be used on just gasoline type
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
fires the answer is yes
 
04:04:30.479 --> 04:04:31.910 align:start position:0%
fires the answer is yes
but

04:04:31.910 --> 04:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:04:36.469 --> 04:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol in particular those products are
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
miscable and water and because of
 
04:04:45.110 --> 04:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
miscobol and water this particular foam
 
04:04:47.750 --> 04:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
works well in trying to put a film over
 
04:04:50.790 --> 04:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
it and that's how it extinguishes it
 
04:04:52.389 --> 04:04:52.399 align:start position:0%
also could be used in lower
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
concentrations to put on a a brush fire
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it does have multi-purpose but
 
04:05:00.150 --> 04:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
getting to this
 
04:05:02.790 --> 04:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
i originally was going to support
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative goalie's uh
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
itl but then it was mentioned uh perhaps
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill
 
04:05:13.349 --> 04:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
and this is a very serious subject it's
 
04:05:16.229 --> 04:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
opening up the door to something uh that
 
04:05:17.990 --> 04:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
else is happening i don't know if you
 
04:05:19.510 --> 04:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
know it but if you when you wear your
 
04:05:22.229 --> 04:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
firefighter gear the same stuff that the
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters wear and fighting the fires
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
is made out of the same
 
04:05:28.950 --> 04:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh products that we're talking about
 
04:05:31.510 --> 04:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
here so just by putting on your coat and
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
your bunker pants you are exposed
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
but the thing is this is a situation
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
that does have in some communities uh
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
something pertained
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh i would wouldn't mind giving it uh
 
04:05:47.429 --> 04:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
because of the needs of those
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
communities of giving them the crack to
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
look at it but there's a lot of changes
 
04:05:55.750 --> 04:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of work the 180 20
 
04:05:55.760 --> 04:05:56.710 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of work the 180 20
days

04:05:56.710 --> 04:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
days
 
04:05:59.189 --> 04:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
of notification you know that's going to
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
be have to be reworked and
 
04:06:03.429 --> 04:06:03.439 align:start position:0%
make sure that municipalities aren't
 
04:06:05.510 --> 04:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
going to be uh held harmless
 
04:06:09.030 --> 04:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
and trying to come up with ideas so
 
04:06:09.040 --> 04:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
and trying to come up with ideas so
i'll

04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
i would be open to retaining this
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
only because the subject matter it is
 
04:06:16.080 --> 04:06:17.269 align:start position:0%
only because the subject matter it is
something

04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:06:19.670 --> 04:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh being on the fire department we have
 
04:06:22.630 --> 04:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
hazards materials teams we are concerned
 
04:06:24.150 --> 04:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
with the environment
 
04:06:27.349 --> 04:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
and if one of the products we are using
 
04:06:30.710 --> 04:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
is causing some you know harm although
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
not maliciously
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's one of the agents we use
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
to help the public and extinguishing the
 
04:06:36.800 --> 04:06:37.750 align:start position:0%
to help the public and extinguishing the
fires

04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
fires
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
maybe it might be worth behoovers
 
04:06:42.309 --> 04:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
to retain it
 
04:06:43.990 --> 04:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
take a good look at it and if the
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation from the committee that
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
retained it is to itl
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
then let's go for it but uh
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's something that is uh
 
04:06:55.750 --> 04:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
worthy i think of us to take a look at
 
04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well uh first of
 
04:07:06.710 --> 04:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
all uh it's clearly a 28-inch a 28a
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
issue representative pearson also
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
already likely referred to that earlier
 
04:07:15.670 --> 04:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh but there's no question that this uh
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
not viable not workable and it's since
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a very strong 28a issue with no
 
04:07:24.550 --> 04:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
funding provided in the bill it's just
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
not workable so
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that we had some
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
of an amendment
 
04:07:35.910 --> 04:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
that could use the bill as a vehicle we
 
04:07:37.990 --> 04:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
can study
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
this issue which is worthy of
 
04:07:42.229 --> 04:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
consideration by the committee with
 
04:07:43.910 --> 04:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
especially with our expertise with all
 
04:07:45.830 --> 04:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
the firefighters
 
04:07:47.910 --> 04:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
and for former municipal people on the
 
04:07:47.920 --> 04:07:49.590 align:start position:0%
and for former municipal people on the
committee

04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
we could study anything we want to we
 
04:07:53.110 --> 04:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to have a bill but the bill
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
could serve as a viable vehicle for
 
04:07:59.269 --> 04:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment i have no idea what the
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment is but
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
apparently it's non-tremaine by one
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
remark i heard earlier so
 
04:08:07.830 --> 04:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
that might be the route we want to go we
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to retain the bill in order
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
to study the issue
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:12.479 --> 04:08:14.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair yes that that
 
04:08:18.630 --> 04:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
basically is the point i was going to
 
04:08:18.640 --> 04:08:19.590 align:start position:0%
basically is the point i was going to
make

04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh if the committee agrees with my
 
04:08:24.870 --> 04:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
non-jermaine amendment and
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the amendment i'm hoping to put forward
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the subject
 
04:08:33.030 --> 04:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
matter of this bill and
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
by virtue of replacing it with that
 
04:08:35.359 --> 04:08:37.030 align:start position:0%
by virtue of replacing it with that
amendment

04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:08:39.670 --> 04:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
this particular bill would not be shown
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to legislate
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
therefore a bill with similar
 
04:08:44.800 --> 04:08:46.550 align:start position:0%
therefore a bill with similar
[Music]

04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
tenants in it could come forward next
 
04:08:48.880 --> 04:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
tenants in it could come forward next
year

04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
with no problem
 
04:08:53.830 --> 04:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i hope that the sponsors are still
 
04:08:56.389 --> 04:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
listening i would urge them to go
 
04:08:58.630 --> 04:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
forward with that idea
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
and making some of the corrections that
 
04:09:03.830 --> 04:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
were suggested here today
 
04:09:04.790 --> 04:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:09:04.800 --> 04:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
thank you

lot kinder than ours
 
04:09:15.670 --> 04:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
the our town would not pay for this map
 
04:09:17.030 --> 04:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
they would tell them they're not
 
04:09:19.030 --> 04:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
interested in saving developers money
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
they tell you the developer i built some
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
houses in salem and i decided i want to

us
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
just saying
 
04:09:37.199 --> 04:09:38.469 align:start position:0%
just saying
ah

04:09:38.469 --> 04:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
ah
 
04:09:41.030 --> 04:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's nice that we have local control
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.389 --> 04:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to i want to jump on
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
something that uh representative schmidt
 
04:09:48.479 --> 04:09:50.070 align:start position:0%
something that uh representative schmidt
said

04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:09:52.389 --> 04:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
in reference to to the look back that we
 
04:09:54.469 --> 04:09:54.479 align:start position:0%
did when we had when representative prue
 
04:09:56.070 --> 04:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
was on this committee we did in fact
 
04:09:59.590 --> 04:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
have a committee that looked at
 
04:10:01.590 --> 04:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
this issue two years ago
 
04:10:01.600 --> 04:10:02.950 align:start position:0%
this issue two years ago
and

04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:10:05.670 --> 04:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
looking back at the at the time the film
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
industry had brought some uh
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
some quote unquote technical experts to
 
04:10:13.670 --> 04:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
our committee to try to shuck and jive
 
04:10:13.680 --> 04:10:14.710 align:start position:0%
our committee to try to shuck and jive
uh

04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:21.750 --> 04:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
we we kind of i think i think we beat
 
04:10:23.349 --> 04:10:23.359 align:start position:0%
him down pretty hard i mean mark and i
 
04:10:26.150 --> 04:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
were kind of brutal on those guys
 
04:10:27.349 --> 04:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
you know but
 
04:10:29.910 --> 04:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
but look honestly you know let's let's
 
04:10:32.389 --> 04:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
not get lost in the weeds here as far as
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know yes
 
04:10:36.070 --> 04:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely the fire service those of us
 
04:10:37.110 --> 04:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
that have been in the fire service
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
really do have a have a concern over
 
04:10:41.830 --> 04:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
over the gear and over the pfast that's
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
involved in all that
 
04:10:46.870 --> 04:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
no question but again focusing back on
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that we're looking at house
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill 141 it which doesn't talk about
 
04:10:52.870 --> 04:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
gear which doesn't talk about really
 
04:10:54.790 --> 04:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
anything in relationship to the people
 
04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
that have used this this is really just
 
04:10:56.399 --> 04:10:57.189 align:start position:0%
that have used this this is really just
about

04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
trying to take a deep dive into
 
04:11:02.630 --> 04:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
ground water contamination and i think
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
that can handle a very different way
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:10.640 --> 04:11:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
in

04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:11:13.189 --> 04:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
and just
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
this this right we looked at this two
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
years ago i mean the subcommittee the
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee did some good work two
 
04:11:19.349 --> 04:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
years ago so i think putting this back
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
into another subcommittee
 
04:11:24.950 --> 04:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
to to do what we did two years ago
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
is going to probably produce the same
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
result so i mean if that's
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:34.710 --> 04:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative fellows
 
04:11:37.590 --> 04:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my my thought
 
04:11:39.349 --> 04:11:39.359 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
retaining it would be a good idea
 
04:11:41.199 --> 04:11:42.309 align:start position:0%
retaining it would be a good idea
because

04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
if we could just make it
 
04:11:47.269 --> 04:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
not retro not reporting
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
events in the past but just going
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
forward that that would not be a huge
 
04:11:54.790 --> 04:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
burden on the towns to report that and i
 
04:11:56.710 --> 04:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
think it's important
 
04:11:56.720 --> 04:11:57.910 align:start position:0%
think it's important
for

04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
not just groundwater issues but also for
 
04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
the firefighters because it would also
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
be a record of their exposure also
 
04:12:07.750 --> 04:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes except the current law already
 
04:12:11.110 --> 04:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
requires reporting going forward
 
04:12:12.950 --> 04:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
so we don't need to build
 
04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is already there
 
04:12:18.150 --> 04:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay i'll i'll look at that
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
existing statue
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:26.790 --> 04:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and that's one of
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
the points i was just going to bring up
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
leading into
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
i would
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
ask that the
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee go and read
 
04:12:37.429 --> 04:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
what this bill is looking to replace rsa
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
154 colon 8b because i pulled it up and
 
04:12:43.830 --> 04:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
brings back some memory of when we did
 
04:12:46.229 --> 04:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
pass this bill um
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
a few years back
 
04:12:48.000 --> 04:12:48.950 align:start position:0%
a few years back
and

04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
that it does
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
require beginning january 1st 2020 no
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
person local government or state
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
agencies shall discharge or otherwise
 
04:12:58.469 --> 04:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
use for training or testing purposes
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
class b firefighting foam which pfest
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
chemicals has been intentionally added
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
however testing
 
04:13:07.110 --> 04:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
shall be done at regulated facilities
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
that are contained in treated disposals
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
done properly
 
04:13:13.189 --> 04:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
um so we've already said that
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
they cannot be used um we've also
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
des department shall survey
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities throughout the state
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
on the quantity stock and legacy forms
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
and determine the cost of instituting a
 
04:13:30.149 --> 04:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
take back program
 
04:13:32.469 --> 04:13:32.479 align:start position:0%
and beginning on july 1 2021 the
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
department shall institute a take back
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
program on these farms for the purpose
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
of safe and contained disposal
 
04:13:42.710 --> 04:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
and then finally madam chair in in this
 
04:13:45.750 --> 04:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh rsa is anytime a class b
 
04:13:47.429 --> 04:13:47.439 align:start position:0%
and specifically to what you just spoke
 
04:13:47.439 --> 04:13:48.469 align:start position:0%
and specifically to what you just spoke
to

04:13:48.469 --> 04:13:48.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:13:50.710 --> 04:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
anytime a class b firefighting foam to
 
04:13:52.389 --> 04:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
which pfast chemicals has been
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
intentionally added is discharged
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
municipality making the discharge shall
 
04:13:58.870 --> 04:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
notify the department of environmental
 
04:14:01.030 --> 04:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
services within 48 hours of such
 
04:14:01.040 --> 04:14:02.309 align:start position:0%
services within 48 hours of such
discharge

04:14:02.309 --> 04:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is doing everything this rsa
 
04:14:08.070 --> 04:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
already does everything we're talking
 
04:14:10.630 --> 04:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
about that we're looking to retain so i
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't believe there is a reason to
 
04:14:14.149 --> 04:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
retain this because
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
um it is all being documented now here
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
on going forward
 
04:14:21.189 --> 04:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
um so with that i
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
urge the committee not to retain it i
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
think the work's been done previously
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
and if you go look at the rsa uh you
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
will see that and thank you
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative allegro i just had a
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
procedural question of the chair please
 
04:14:37.670 --> 04:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
um since we have a motion on the floor
 
04:14:39.269 --> 04:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
are we allowed to
 
04:14:40.950 --> 04:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
before we deal with that consider
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.030 --> 04:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
since it's an itl motion we cannot
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly consider our amendments you
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
have to have an ought to pass
 
04:14:57.269 --> 04:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation to consider amendments
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
however my intention is to let us
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
debate this until it seems like we've
 
04:15:04.870 --> 04:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
reached a conclusion
 
04:15:07.990 --> 04:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and then on next monday we are scheduled
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
to hear that amendment and after that we
 
04:15:10.880 --> 04:15:12.070 align:start position:0%
to hear that amendment and after that we
can

04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:15:12.080 --> 04:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
can
uh

04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:14.710 --> 04:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
withdraw this motion
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
or and move on to pass with the
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
amendment or we can
 
04:15:19.199 --> 04:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
amendment or we can
uh

04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the itl if we don't like
 
04:15:21.920 --> 04:15:22.790 align:start position:0%
go ahead with the itl if we don't like
that

04:15:22.790 --> 04:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:15:25.189 --> 04:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
i understand thank you all right
 
04:15:26.790 --> 04:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
no that's where we should go that's the
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
way we should do it carol
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
right where we will not take a vote
 
04:15:32.550 --> 04:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
today but we should
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
finish the debate and uh
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
come to make up our minds
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
representative schultz do you still have
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
a question or comment
 
04:15:43.910 --> 04:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative goalie answered it and
 
04:15:46.149 --> 04:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
didn't even know it
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
good job
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
 
04:15:50.080 --> 04:15:51.030 align:start position:0%
representative lekkas
uh

04:15:51.030 --> 04:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
my question's already been asked
 
04:15:53.590 --> 04:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
excellent we're gonna answer your
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
psychic uh i have a question to the
 
04:15:58.070 --> 04:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
chair am i allowed to vote
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative goalie frequently votes
 
04:16:01.040 --> 04:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
representative goalie frequently votes
correctly

04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:09.189 --> 04:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
you are however allowed to vote
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
the same way as him as he does for a
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:21.349 --> 04:16:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt and then phillips
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
no no i i i already said my piece you we
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
should do what you suggested
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh and the the motion can be withdrawn
 
04:16:31.269 --> 04:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
at the appropriate moment we can
 
04:16:33.189 --> 04:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
look at this amendment whatever the heck
 
04:16:35.830 --> 04:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:35.840 --> 04:16:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
then

04:16:37.110 --> 04:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:16:38.630 --> 04:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm just wondering
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
if we can ask mr wimsett um about
 
04:16:43.680 --> 04:16:44.389 align:start position:0%
if we can ask mr wimsett um about
that

04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
this section of the rsa we looked at
 
04:16:46.800 --> 04:16:47.830 align:start position:0%
this section of the rsa we looked at
about

04:16:47.830 --> 04:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:16:51.030 --> 04:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
um that says effective i think january
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
2020 that municipalities should have
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
been reporting this
 
04:17:04.070 --> 04:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
he's still with us yes he is all right
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
mr wimsat we will uh
 
04:17:15.030 --> 04:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:23.910 --> 04:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon madam chair sorry there's
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
a little delay there while i was uh
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
promoted to be a speaker again
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
um i i did hear the question and yes we
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
are collecting that information
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
um and uh i don't think we've gotten an
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
awful lot of reports but we certainly i
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
i think i believe we have received some
 
04:17:44.229 --> 04:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
reports i'm aware of a few circumstances
 
04:17:47.429 --> 04:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
where some class b foam was used um
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes we we have some direct
 
04:17:52.550 --> 04:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that because our emergency
 
04:17:55.670 --> 04:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
response folks who are on call 24 7
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of support to the fire
 
04:17:59.030 --> 04:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
service when
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
um there are uh say for example a
 
04:18:03.990 --> 04:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
petroleum truck that rules over or
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
something we often get called for the
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
environmental piece of that we provide
 
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
direct support to the fire service so
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
we're often
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
in the know when that kind of
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance has occurred and uh so i do
 
04:18:17.429 --> 04:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
believe we have some information about
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
that yes
 
04:18:21.429 --> 04:18:21.439 align:start position:0%
so follow up
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes just um so does that mean that
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
you're going to keep track of that
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
information so three years from now
 
04:18:31.750 --> 04:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to see that anybody from
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the public who wanted to see that would
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
have access to that information
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
right so so anytime we get involved in a
 
04:18:41.830 --> 04:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
response or receive a report it becomes
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
part of our records and those are public
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
records that would be available
 
04:18:46.640 --> 04:18:47.510 align:start position:0%
records that would be available
well

04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
i guess just to clarify
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
is it going to be in some kind of log or
 
04:18:55.510 --> 04:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
would that all of those incidents be
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
kind of like in a spreadsheet something
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
like that
 
04:19:00.950 --> 04:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think right now probably the answer is
 
04:19:02.710 --> 04:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
the latter it's it's very likely in a
 
04:19:06.070 --> 04:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and but said that also if we
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
receive a report about an incident
 
04:19:10.550 --> 04:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
it goes into our um
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh database of sites in a place that's
 
04:19:15.990 --> 04:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
had a release where we've done some
 
04:19:18.229 --> 04:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
received information and if you're
 
04:19:20.149 --> 04:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
familiar with our one stop system where
 
04:19:21.910 --> 04:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
you can go online and search in the
 
04:19:24.550 --> 04:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
community for for information it would
 
04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
likely be available there as well but
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes we very likely
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
have it in the spreadsheet
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:19:33.760 --> 04:19:36.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
goalie

04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
like may a question of mr wimsat while
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
he's still here with us
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be um
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
taking a survey of municipalities on the
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
legacy phones and the socks they have
 
04:20:00.790 --> 04:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
and then it says
 
04:20:02.630 --> 04:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
according to the statue beginning july
 
04:20:02.640 --> 04:20:03.429 align:start position:0%
according to the statue beginning july
1st

04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
you'll start instituting a take back
 
04:20:06.640 --> 04:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
you'll start instituting a take back
program

04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:20:10.389 --> 04:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
are you folks uh how is that going so
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
far and uh are you in
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh a place to start that on july 1st
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
sure so so we will be reporting on that
 
04:20:18.720 --> 04:20:19.590 align:start position:0%
sure so so we will be reporting on that
um

04:20:19.590 --> 04:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
early on we were doing pretty well
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
because we had identified actually
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
a small source of funding through an
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
unrelated enforcement action that we
 
04:20:29.189 --> 04:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
were working on
 
04:20:31.030 --> 04:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
and a facility that could take these
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
legacy foams and treat them
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that that facility was in
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
new york state
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
and for a variety of reasons there have
 
04:20:41.429 --> 04:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
been questions that's been called into
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
question whether that facility can
 
04:20:43.359 --> 04:20:44.710 align:start position:0%
question whether that facility can
safely

04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
safely
 
04:20:46.550 --> 04:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
treat those materials
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
and at least temporarily it is no longer
 
04:20:52.309 --> 04:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
able to accept foams for destruction
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
so as a result there really isn't a good
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh option for disposal right now
 
04:21:00.309 --> 04:21:00.319 align:start position:0%
and so we are trying to sort out where
 
04:21:01.750 --> 04:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to go on that so we will
 
04:21:03.670 --> 04:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
certainly report on that by the deadline
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm sorry to say we're not going
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
to have
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
a take-back program set up and ready and
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
operational because we don't have
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
regionally or even really nationally
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
there are no good
 
04:21:16.870 --> 04:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
solutions for where these materials can
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:24.309 --> 04:21:24.319 align:start position:0%

no we're going to recess the meeting
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%

04:21:39.510 --> 04:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
we could be changed
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%

04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
exact or try to
 
04:22:09.910 --> 04:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
the few remaining bills we have we have
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
a leftover
 
04:22:12.080 --> 04:22:13.990 align:start position:0%

lunch break
 
04:22:40.149 --> 04:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
and he confirmed that we technically
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
should have
 
04:22:41.600 --> 04:22:43.189 align:start position:0%
should have
reconsidered

04:22:43.189 --> 04:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
reconsidered
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
our previous vote on ought to pass as
 
04:22:46.080 --> 04:22:47.429 align:start position:0%

yes and in the future if it ever comes
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
up again i will do so i i
 
04:22:56.790 --> 04:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
remembered a different section of masons
 
04:23:02.210 --> 04:23:02.220 align:start position:0%

04:23:08.630 --> 04:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
apply on the house floor but not in
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
committee or something like that but i
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to be sure that going
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
forward the process would be correct
 
04:23:19.040 --> 04:23:21.250 align:start position:0%
forward the process would be correct
yes

04:23:21.250 --> 04:23:21.260 align:start position:0%

i agree
 
04:23:36.309 --> 04:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't even i wouldn't even want to
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have any uh issues or
 
04:23:41.920 --> 04:23:46.070 align:start position:0%

concerns

04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
in that case we will uh
 
04:23:49.199 --> 04:23:50.950 align:start position:0%

getting someone from fiscal
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%

04:24:02.319 --> 04:24:03.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:25:01.990 --> 04:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
to explain how fiscal works and relative
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
to emergency workers so
 
04:25:07.279 --> 04:25:09.590 align:start position:0%
to emergency workers so
that

04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.830 --> 04:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
he's currently chair of fiscal and has
 
04:25:13.990 --> 04:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
been on it uh
 
04:25:16.149 --> 04:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
many times
 
04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
should that be on monday next that he
 
04:25:21.189 --> 04:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
will talk to us now as soon as you get
 
04:25:29.830 --> 04:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:31.590 --> 04:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
that was that was a question that came
 
04:25:33.429 --> 04:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
up and
 
04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any of us has had
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
what was the question
 
04:25:50.229 --> 04:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
how the
 
04:25:52.790 --> 04:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
emer how whether fiscal could deal with
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
emergency orders
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
assuming this is the amendment to 417.
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
or any the other emergency bills we
 
04:26:10.070 --> 04:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
we were concerned about oversight and
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal is definitely one of the places
 
04:26:16.630 --> 04:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
that oversight would make sense
 
04:26:19.269 --> 04:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
representative elect as my concern was
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
whether we should send it to governor
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
and council or governor and with the
 
04:26:25.349 --> 04:26:25.359 align:start position:0%
oversight of the fiscal committee
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
so that's where i just want to hear
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
where fiscal stood in versus the council
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
approving expenditures and
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriations actually there is a uh
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
statute which i don't remember the the
 
04:26:38.550 --> 04:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
number of hand uh representative mcguire
 
04:26:39.990 --> 04:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
pointed it out
 
04:26:41.830 --> 04:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:26:41.840 --> 04:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
that um
says

04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
any expenditures over some amount that
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
had to go
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
to governor and council also had to go
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
to fiscal so i think this existing
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
statute made it happen
 
04:27:09.910 --> 04:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the moment you can because it's not
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
governor of council that was why
 
04:27:23.429 --> 04:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
i think it was rsa 1413a
 
04:28:11.910 --> 04:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.309 --> 04:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
yeah fourteen is legislative officers
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
and proceedings and fiscal
 
04:28:18.239 --> 04:28:19.429 align:start position:0%
and proceedings and fiscal
fourteen

04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
fourteen
 
04:28:19.439 --> 04:28:20.469 align:start position:0%
fourteen
thirty

04:28:20.469 --> 04:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
thirty
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
dash a is the fiscal committee
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:55.990 --> 04:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
yeah 14 colon 30-a roman 6 says any
 
04:28:58.309 --> 04:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
non-state funds in excess of a hundred
 
04:28:59.750 --> 04:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
and thousand
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
including refunds of expenditures
 
04:29:05.030 --> 04:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
federal aid local funds gifts requests
 
04:29:07.429 --> 04:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
grants and funds from any other
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
non-state sources
 
04:29:11.110 --> 04:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
which under state law require the
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
approval of governor and council for
 
04:29:15.189 --> 04:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
acceptance and expenditure
 
04:29:16.229 --> 04:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
may be
 
04:29:18.950 --> 04:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
accepted and expended by the proper
 
04:29:21.510 --> 04:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
persons or agencies in the state
 
04:29:23.510 --> 04:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
government only with the prior approval
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal committee of the general
 
04:29:25.120 --> 04:29:28.710 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal committee of the general
court

04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:30.710 --> 04:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
so by adding governor and council to
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
governor and council i guess it uh
 
04:29:32.640 --> 04:29:34.229 align:start position:0%
governor and council i guess it uh
invokes

04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
invokes
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
that bit of statute
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
has the government needed to wait other
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
statutes already
 
04:29:42.790 --> 04:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
well that's
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and that's my
 
04:29:46.790 --> 04:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
question is if we just by putting
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
governor council does it revert back to
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
that rsa or not because this is in 21p
 
04:29:55.590 --> 04:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
colon 43 emergency statute
 
04:29:57.349 --> 04:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to need to reference that
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
statute when we do this to make sure
 
04:30:01.110 --> 04:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative weiler may be able to
 
04:30:03.110 --> 04:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
help us on that
 
04:30:04.550 --> 04:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
as soon as he gets here we'll have to
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%

04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%

yeah this morning
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh those two bills you mentioned madam
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
chair were actually listed for today on
 
04:32:07.990 --> 04:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
one part of the
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
website calendar and then it changed
 
04:32:10.720 --> 04:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
website calendar and then it changed
midday

04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
midday
 
04:32:14.950 --> 04:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
well they were intended to be done next
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
week i mean i would have liked to have
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
done them today but i couldn't get
 
04:32:20.790 --> 04:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't get them in time to put them
 
04:32:22.630 --> 04:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
in the calendar they're actually in the
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
paper calendar at least i get it nailed
 
04:32:27.189 --> 04:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh for next monday
 
04:32:29.429 --> 04:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
right it's correct on the paper one and
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's some place it confused me because
 
04:32:31.760 --> 04:32:32.630 align:start position:0%
it's some place it confused me because
well

04:32:32.630 --> 04:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:34.710 --> 04:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
it probably doesn't even matter but
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
in some part of the website now that we
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
have multiple places to have an
 
04:32:41.110 --> 04:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
electronic calendar which i like
 
04:32:43.990 --> 04:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
um it was listed incorrectly but
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i think i may be the only person
 
04:32:46.319 --> 04:32:47.269 align:start position:0%
i don't i think i may be the only person
who

04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
noticed that
 
04:32:50.229 --> 04:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:32:52.070 --> 04:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
things to talk about while we're waiting
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know yes but
 
04:32:54.000 --> 04:32:54.950 align:start position:0%
i don't know yes but
it

04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:32:57.830 --> 04:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was a mistake i wouldn't like i said
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
the monday is inconvenient because you
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to announce you have to get things
 
04:33:02.950 --> 04:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
in the calendar a week and a half in
 
04:33:02.960 --> 04:33:04.709 align:start position:0%
in the calendar a week and a half in
advance

04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
advance
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
so i only had a week on that
 
04:33:10.629 --> 04:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
oh i see a hand up
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:30.820 --> 04:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
why do we have a pfast
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:43.109 align:start position:0%
why do we have a pfast
[Music]

um
 
04:33:46.150 --> 04:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
an issue with the connectivity
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
through the posting process that
 
04:33:54.869 --> 04:33:54.879 align:start position:0%

04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:02.070 --> 04:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes things are showing up on the
 
04:34:02.080 --> 04:34:03.269 align:start position:0%
sometimes things are showing up on the
docket

04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
docket
 
04:34:03.279 --> 04:34:04.629 align:start position:0%
