an opt in uh rather than an opt
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
out uh and that there is an opt out
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
process that anybody can choose and you

uh seemed like it was a good bill uh in
 
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
that case if you're just going to is it
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't be the one that make the
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
motion I could see that
 
00:09:45.069 --> 00:09:45.079 align:start position:0%

pass yes
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
R I think there was some discussion
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
around what age was appropriate but I
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
think 16 seems to be a good a good 16 I
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
mean I G I made sure when my kids had a
 
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
car that yeah they needed they needed a
 
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
credit card to get gas you know they
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
need you know so and to me 16 is
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
definitely the right age
 
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.670 align:start position:0%

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
477 commission review and make
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
recommendations regarding Technology
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
based startup businesses support from
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire okay now
 
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
here's what this is going to be a fun
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
one all right who is willing to serve on
 
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.710 align:start position:0%
one all right who is willing to serve on
this

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
commission I
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
would you are I would do we need four
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
okay but I think there's it's not going
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
to work it's not it's I think interim
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
study is the way to go you don't interim
 
00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:06.519 align:start position:0%
study a study committee a commission
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
well we need to we need to make what I I
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to kill this because I think
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
it's an opportunity for tech companies
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to access grant funding if we
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
make an effort to um support the tech
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
Alliance in this initiative I think this
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee Commerce Committee I think
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
needs to it it it requ as money at the
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
end of the day they're looking for money
 
00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:34.759 align:start position:0%
so there is federal
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
money there is federal money and there
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
is the Innovative fund that the state um
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
funds every year you should have your
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
mic on the Innovation fund right every
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
year they put they matching FS different
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
aren't they matching funs yeah that's
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
fine that's fine you really think we're
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
going to cough up with matching funds
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
through the Innovation funds depends
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
which party wins in November there's
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
there's always there's always moneyone
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
you're going to want to use the money to
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
fund education you're not going to want
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
to give it to high tech companies right
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
now it's supporting healthcare
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
workers next year it can support you
 
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
know the tech Alliance
 
00:16:17.269 --> 00:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
or I don't know I I don't want to kill
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
it because I think we're we're take
 
00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
we're not I I think we can get some
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
federal money we somehow like I say you
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
you between now and next Tuesday when we
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
ex this okay you need to find three
 
00:16:32.749 --> 00:16:32.759 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee who are
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
willing to be on it okay and then
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
otherwise otherwise I'm not going to
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
pass something if nobody wants to be on
 
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
it she's she's tagged she's it well the
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
Republicans don't want to pay for
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
anything so I mean that's the
 
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:51.240 align:start position:0%
problem um okay all right so uh we will
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
and I will talk to the um the people
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
that came in to speak in theal the tech
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
Alliance I will talk to them about the
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
Mission and look to see if there's you
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
know if we can minimize moves to
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.350 align:start position:0%
 
motion

00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
yep all
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
right and like I say I will ask I'll be
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
posing that question at exec and if we
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't have people want to do it then you
 
00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
know why why why set up a you know
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't know about you on your
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
side but on our side will be here in the
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
chairman Vice chairman meeting is is
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
there are too many commissions and get
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
three months too I mean it wasn't a
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
lengthy I think I like I said I think if
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
we I know by the time you get all the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
appointments it's the time I don't think
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
I think we can just meet for okay maybe
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
once or twice and then we'll come up
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
with some
 
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720 align:start position:0%
legislation okay is the motion clear
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
have to pass all those in favor say I I
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
one two
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
three one two three
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
four yes okay all those opposed one
 
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:13.480 align:start position:0%
two okay that's four to two
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
y okay all right all right now now we're
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
ready for some fun Senate Bill
 
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
97 use of animal products
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
testing I think we should uh interim
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
study this bill
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment right do we have
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
an amendment where do I put
 
00:18:39.029 --> 00:18:39.039 align:start position:0%
online what's that it was was yeah
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
somebody emailed it to me can I get it
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
from Carrie right it was does she have
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
it from this is yeah this is from
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
Gina yeah yes it's from Gina
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
Gina what motion are you putting I I
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
think we should just interum study the
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
bill and sort this thing out in terms of
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
you know what what exactly is
 
00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:03.799 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Dartmouth and UNH doing to
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
animals but the maybe they're doing mice
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
things you know who knows what they're
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
doing there's a bigger problem with it
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
there's no enforcement there's no
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
nothing no yeah the enforcement entity
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
was was hugely problematic right that
 
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.029 align:start position:0%
was was hugely problematic right that
that

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
didn't I'm not going that VI Justice
 
00:19:19.789 --> 00:19:19.799 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
that was
recommended

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
right so in inter study we would just
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
we'll work on it this you know and see
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
if there's some way we can get there
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
so so you're going to be working on it
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
during the summer so what I interim
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
study interim study we won't I don't

UL are you familiar with that it's the
 
00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:14.799 align:start position:0%
European equivalent to the UL standard
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
for the United States yeah it's are you
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with that I'm not familiar with
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
it so I'm Brian Allard the assistant
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
director with the Fire Marshals office
 
00:22:23.269 --> 00:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
Marshall Tumi couldn't be here today
 
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
okay I know he did submit the written
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
testimony if you support of this but I'm
 
00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:27.919 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that particular
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
standard and you're
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
saying I saw he he he's unfamiliar okay
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
but as I read the bill
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
now it
 
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
says any
 
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.789 align:start position:0%
says any
personal

00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
by and this is part of a complete
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
electrical system yeah so it's it's
 
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
saying it only is accepting Underwriters
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that's where we're a
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
little concerned because if it's made in
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
China it might not have the underwriters
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
certificate on it it might have the the
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
European the European one um I know the
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
most of the legislation across the
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
United States right now is referencing
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
the UL uh standards um and that's kind
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
of what our position has been right
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
along okay and then and uh enforcement
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
how was this going to be
 
00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:26.799 align:start position:0%
enforced this is just if you happen to
 
00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
stumble upon one of these you
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we're certainly take it away from
 
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.669 align:start position:0%
yeah we're certainly take it away from
the

00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:38.039 align:start position:0%
person not sure we we've certainly had
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
um buyers within the state that
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
potentially could have been uh due to a
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
non listed device uh we have not been
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
able to pinpoint that specifically um
 
00:23:53.269 --> 00:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
but certainly there there's a big push
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
out in New York City specifically for
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
the UL standards uh because there's been
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
several fires
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative spear the iso stands
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
for international standards organization
 
00:24:06.269 --> 00:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
and it's ISO
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
23625 colon
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
2021 for lithium batteries every country
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledges those those isos right but
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's not in this bill yeah we and
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's what we should have in the bill
 
00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
we going to amend it you want to amend
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
this bill to add
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we said we going to do that Ed the
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
iso standard yeah because everybody
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
knows those
 
00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:31.950 align:start position:0%
knows those
right

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.990 align:start position:0%
okay okay
um

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we need an amendment uh we would need
 
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.710 align:start position:0%
so we need an amendment uh we would need
an

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
an
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
amendment oneliner I guess she just just
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
ISO is all we needed to add well you say
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
ISO you could say that the specific ISO
 
00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:51.559 align:start position:0%
standard yeah well which is what they
 
00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679 align:start position:0%
did with the UL yeah just add the iso
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
standard and then that will pick up
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
everybody because that's an
 
00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.830 align:start position:0%
everybody because that's an
international

00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
international
 
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
standard but you don't want to you know
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
maybe uh do you want do you want to go
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
down to legislative services today to uh
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
get an amendment I don't know how to do
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
that but I I'll show you I'll sure can I
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
just sure okay representative Ammon uh
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
this seems to be we call prophylactic
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation it it doesn't seem to be
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
backed by actual data that that's my
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
concern um because New York City's doing
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
it that's a very populated place you
 
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
know with uh high-rise buildings and you
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
know it's we don't have we're more rural
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
arees in Manchester there's a few I
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't call them
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
highrise so I I'd be before enter and
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
studying this bill that that would be my
 
00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
studying this bill that that would be my
position

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
but representative Barrow yeah I just
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
want to say know I don't have obviously
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
you know I don't have specific data but
 
00:25:58.389 --> 00:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
um I read the Times and there have been
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
numerous stories there was one pretty
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
recently about a month ago of people
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
dying because the they had had their
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
bicycles in their apartment and um it
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
was it was really tragic recently a
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
young man I think he was like 28 um died
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
um when his bike caught fire and it was
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
an apartment building it could have
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
really and and there have been numerous
 
00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
stories about that and I when I last
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
thing when I went on um an airplane
 
00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
recently I had I had a suitcase brand
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
that has a battery one of those
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
batteries and she said is your battery
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
in the suitcase and I had to tell her
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
that I I took it out right they wouldn't
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
let it on the planes so right no I know
 
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
the airlines are very very tough about
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
so there's a reason they do that so but
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
but that's begs the question that it
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
whether it had the standard on it
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
already and it was just a malfunctioning
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
battery yeah but if I always heard the
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
the the number one problem is
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
overcharging that people plug leave it
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
plugged in and they don't they don't
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
unplug it and it overcharges and that's
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
what causes the or should we interim
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
study it I would prefer to interim study
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
it make sure we really do this right
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay yes I would prefer that is
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
everybody okay within room study yep
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay so just what we need is a little
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
more detail on how it terms of other um
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
certifications all right and how that
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
certification is supposed to work um and
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
and and mean I we certainly are not
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to the concept that we want to
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
make sure that we don't have any
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
fraudulent lithium batteries out there
 
00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
but at the same time we're you we
 
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
haven't had really any evidence that
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
that is the problem was that there was
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
they were fake ones or someone I don't
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
know I don't know how do you make a fake
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
or whatever you do but but I guess we
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
need to know how how we're going to do
 
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
that uh structure that and and before we
 
00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
put it in our statutes okay very good
 
00:28:02.029 --> 00:28:02.039 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so we don't need it don't
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
need the
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.669 --> 00:28:12.679 align:start position:0%
Ammon second by representative burough
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
study any discussion on the
 
00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
motion all right all those in favor say
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
I I one two three four five six okay
 
00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
just can I just say I just looked up um
 
00:28:35.549 --> 00:28:35.559 align:start position:0%
online there according this there have
 
00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:36.269 align:start position:0%
online there according this there have
been

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
25,000 uh fires caused by these
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
batteries over a 5year period right but
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
does it say anything about whether
 
00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
they whether they were fakes or whether
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
knows chairman hunt yes it's counterfeit
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
it can be counterfeit batteries so it
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
still have the the sticker on it yeah
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
you're right yeah it could be a
 
00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
counterfeit battery and still have the
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
sticker on
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
it all right so we do I yeah that's why
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
we need to do little more homework on
 
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:15.430 align:start position:0%

okay all right here we go to the next
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
here's the next exciting one uh
 
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
restricting the purchase of real
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
property on and around military
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
installations okay who would like to
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
make the interim study motion interim
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
study that we're going to kill it you
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
want to kill
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
it you guys really yeah me too all
 
00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.789 align:start position:0%
it you guys really yeah me too all
right

00:30:55.789 --> 00:30:55.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
chines okay
 
00:31:00.669 --> 00:31:00.679 align:start position:0%
what it is true we have we already have
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
a China
 
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
bill that we a house one that we we
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
inter we did inter so that would that
 
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
would give a reason why we wouldn't
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
bother inter studing this one because
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're already getting I just think it
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
sends a message how bad it was what itl
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
yeah one of one of the problems is it
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
says relative restricting the purchase
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
of real property on or around military
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
installations and then it goes on to
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
list a whole lot of other things that
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
have nothing not just military it's it's
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
it it read this phrase right after it it
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
says uh
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
structural structural but that's the
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
point it's not it's not a bill about
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
military I was okay as long as they said
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
something about military just as a
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
Feelgood but it got into everything did
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
you see the email birel sent that's or
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
did she send it to me anything really
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
use well she said the guy North Dakota
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
had passed it and they had they didn't
 
00:31:58.509 --> 00:31:58.519 align:start position:0%
have any problems with it in north OTA
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I go well isn't North Dakota where
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
they have all those missile sites isn't
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
that where that woman who killed her dog
 
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.509 align:start position:0%
that where that woman who killed her dog
as

00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:12.389 align:start position:0%
 
Governor

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
okay but but the idea yeah B choice so
 
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
but the big problem I had was the
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
testimony was was that if you are if if
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
you are a Chinese People's Republic
 
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
you are a Chinese People's Republic
citizen

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
that means you are part of the
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
government because you're that's and but
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
that was the testimony so that was where
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
I got hung up on whereas you know am I
 
00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:42.519 align:start position:0%
I'm G to ask you know someone any who
 
00:32:44.909 --> 00:32:44.919 align:start position:0%
from who's from China you know whether I
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
was going to rent them to my vacation
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
rental and she says oh yeah another
 
00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
South North Dakota doesn't have that
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
problem sure there's a lot of vacation
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
rentals in North Dakota but not
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
withstanding that but I just don't I
 
00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:58.840 align:start position:0%
just just don't know if that bill was
 
00:33:01.629 --> 00:33:01.639 align:start position:0%
written the same way as this one was
 
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
this one this one seemed like a non
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
struggle thing that did happen as a
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
result of that incident in North Dakota
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
was that the United States government
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
now says that if any if a if a chinese
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
firm wants to buy land within a 100
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
miles of a military base they have to
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
ask for permission from the federal
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
government if it's approved then they
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
can go buy whatever they want right so
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
at that point it's a federal issue as
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
far as security is concerned and that I
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
have quite a bit of knowledge about okay
 
00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
this thing does nothing with respect to
 
00:33:34.039 --> 00:33:36.830 align:start position:0%
this thing does nothing with respect to
security

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
so it's in conflict with the Federal
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
Regulation and it doesn't have anything
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
security okay all
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
right yeah oh R guys are having a good
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
conversation and I'm listening okay but
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
the fact you just have to yell at me and
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
say you want to speak
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay um but there there is federal
 
00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislation in effect now that puts some
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions on the sale of property
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh if it's within a 100 miles of a
 
00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.190 align:start position:0%
uh if it's within a 100 miles of a
military

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
military
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
base they have to ask for
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
permission then the feds say yes no and
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
then they can sell whatever they want or
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
buy the land or whatever yeah I thought
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
Nikki Haley got reamed because she sold
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
a bunch of land right next to him
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
military no they didn't sell it they
 
00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:30.950 align:start position:0%
military no they didn't sell it they
bought

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
bought
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
it South Carolina who bought oh in South
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
Carolina I'm sorry South Carolina that
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
they it was a there there was she
 
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
did take help for having having the
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
South Carolina but to them it was an
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
economic development issue they were all
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
very excited about having you know
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
having that that Chinese company come to
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
to South Carolina and right
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the fact that it was too
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
close to a military China owns a bunch
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
of stuff in the United States tick Tok
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
too you know yeah no but I mean they
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
built a a multi-billion dollar uh pipe
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
facility in
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
Texas uh McConnell sold some property in
 
00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:12.829 align:start position:0%
Texas uh McConnell sold some property in
his

00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
state but uh so I don't I I think it's
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
very difficult problematic but I'm anti
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
I'm anti-pry anyway
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
so China is the 18th if you count who
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
owns the most land according to Forbes
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
Magazine it's the
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
18th owner number one is Canada
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
Netherlands Saudi Arabia is in there
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
Iran is in there where do we draw the
 
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:43.000 align:start position:0%
line I mean they're 18th they don't own
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
that much but they do own businesses and
 
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
they have as part of our
 
00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
economic stability for this country uh
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
we encourage foreign investments we have
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
foreign investments on everything and
 
00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240 align:start position:0%
they are a partner of ours they're a big
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
partner actually we buy a lot of our
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
exports you know so I just I just was
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
laws okay I think we're the
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
consensus is itl yes it is so
 
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative spear second by
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay the motion
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
clear all those in favor say I I those
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh okay you know the scanning of non-
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
drivers identification card by real
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so this one yeah so you pull up
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
says no no we're talking about making an
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
so this is for people that don't drive
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
and have IDs who don't have a Auto
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
ID relatively SK non drivers IDs cars so
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
is cuz
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
I mean because you have after the
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
closing cell you it it's a very short
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
period of
 
00:38:09.069 --> 00:38:09.079 align:start position:0%
time and and I'm okay with breaking the
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
law real ID so that's that's a driver's
 
00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.750 align:start position:0%
law real ID so that's that's a driver's
license

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
dri you don't driver you can get an ID a
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
regular ID a real ID okay I did it with
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
my driver's license I think wants to
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
make the motion
 
00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:32.670 align:start position:0%
make the motion
about

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:51.349 align:start position:0%
 
change

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
change

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh you can get a real ID without a
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.589 --> 00:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
and then B in the bill in the actual
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
language of the bill yes so we don't we
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
don't amend the title the title gets
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
um the license holders consent to okay
 
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so that that would that the
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
title would be corrected by legislative
 
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
title would be corrected by legislative
services

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
and so what happened
 
00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.470 align:start position:0%
and so what happened
is

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is if actually you look at the the
 
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:37.960 align:start position:0%
bill does it show what the bill as as uh
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
introduced if you go in that was the
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
only version but it does say Amendment
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
or that oh these are just searings yes
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
no Amendment that's introduced okay yeah
 
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
so they they just screw up but yes I
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
think that's what it is we'll make we'll
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that they correct the right
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
the title right but the title doesn't
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
mean anything right okay the analysis is
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
correct yeah yeah the title the title
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
disappears after it'll be in the in the
 
00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.990 align:start position:0%
disappears after it'll be in the in the
actual

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:40:10.829 --> 00:40:10.839 align:start position:0%
um what do they call that yellow
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
book is there such a thing as a
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
non but they'll usually they'll have it
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
corrected but you can get an ID
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
ners yeah well I'm saying it it because
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's just another set of eyes so should
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
we make sure it is in one way or
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
another Kristen yeah so just make sure
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislative Services
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
is knows that they need to correct the
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
title driver's
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
license it say it yeah just it's it just
 
00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:48.839 align:start position:0%
remove the
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
non only it is yeah because the analysis
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
say license good catch so the people
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
with a non ID can't do something in real
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
estate I mean I
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
don't well I mean I know for myself then
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
when my I we took my mother's car away
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
from her and came time for license
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
renewal we just when I went to the
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
register they they asked um they said
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
they said now this was the best part
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
they said so um okay so you know we
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
can't renew the you know you don't want
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
to renew the license so you're going to
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
have to get you get an ID
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
and it looks just like a license oh and
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
it just it says non- driver's license so
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's where the non- driver expression
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
comes from and he goes so not meanwhile
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
she's she's in a nursing home right and
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
he goes I said well do you have anything
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
to prove what her address is and the
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
best I could do was the church
 
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
bulletin was coming to her that add
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
dress in the church bolon and he looked
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
at he looked at that he looked at me he
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay real estate workers
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
so okay where uh where am I on this my
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay there we go five okay um all
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
right so for for now I'll put my name in
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
May we're thinking thaon might want to
 
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:32.200 align:start position:0%
make this motion but
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
um ought to
 
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
um ought to
pass

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
yep any discussion on the
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
motion okay all those in favor say I I
 
00:42:47.359 --> 00:42:52.829 align:start position:0%
motion okay all those in favor say I I
those

00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.839 --> 00:42:54.510 align:start position:0%
 
opposed

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay so all we have left is this
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon are
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
these so these are uh
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
chairman yes can we just do 196 because
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor wants it
 
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:38.309 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor wants it
itl

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah soci said it was overcome by events
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
remember right right but that that's the
 
00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
insurance committee
 
00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:50.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so let's just do it it's
 
00:43:54.069 --> 00:43:54.079 align:start position:0%
itl I know I know everybody wants it
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
have it yeah we'll get toed for at 115
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
we technically can't me in in hindsight
 
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
I I probably should have scheduled all
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
these it just seemed like so many bills
 
00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
and subcommittee I just and I and I I
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
you know I always have to calculate for
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
some of them getting getting bogged down
 
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
on well that one wouldn't and and you
 
00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
know we had I had you know we had a
 
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:23.640 align:start position:0%
couple bogged down you know lithium and
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
and uh well now we just sit around China
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
so okay so so far we got no reason to we
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
can do everything we're aiming for
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
and second by repres car okay yes in
 
03:25:50.349 --> 03:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
exped to legislate um there's no reason
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
to create a licensing for
 
03:25:57.349 --> 03:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
appraisers it's
 
03:25:59.830 --> 03:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
anyways John Hunt's rule of lure
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
remember we only reason we create a
 
03:26:03.269 --> 03:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
license is so we can take it away from
 
03:26:05.349 --> 03:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
you when you've been bad you take it
 
03:26:09.189 --> 03:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.630 --> 03:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
too you like doctor's licenses uh he's
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
the one who said he doesn't like
 
03:26:15.950 --> 03:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
licensing don't get don't throw me into
 
03:26:15.960 --> 03:26:17.110 align:start position:0%
licensing don't get don't throw me into
that

03:26:17.110 --> 03:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:19.229 --> 03:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
H yes I think that we create that
 
03:26:20.830 --> 03:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
license so that we can take it away when
 
03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:22.990 align:start position:0%
license so that we can take it away when
you

03:26:22.990 --> 03:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
when you're bad surgeon so
 
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh all right so the motion is
 
03:26:32.510 --> 03:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
03:26:36.790 --> 03:26:36.800 align:start position:0%

03:26:44.349 --> 03:26:44.359 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:52.710 --> 03:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
okay now now we get to the fun one okay
 
03:26:52.720 --> 03:26:53.550 align:start position:0%
okay now now we get to the fun one okay
uh

03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
423 relative to mandatory disclosure of
 
03:27:00.990 --> 03:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
insurance policy limits representative
 
03:27:04.349 --> 03:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
spear I can make a motion to itl it but
 
03:27:06.630 --> 03:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a comment yes no you
 
03:27:09.189 --> 03:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
can you can then speak to your motion
 
03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative spear moves uh to
 
03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate second by
 
03:27:17.269 --> 03:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative hunt and see the value of
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
some of these things as you know as we
 
03:27:20.550 --> 03:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
heard in the hearing but the problem I
 
03:27:22.590 --> 03:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
have is the same problem that I have
 
03:27:24.389 --> 03:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
with the right to no
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
bill there's no definition of claimant
 
03:27:30.389 --> 03:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of who is allowed
 
03:27:32.349 --> 03:27:32.359 align:start position:0%
to apply for
 
03:27:35.469 --> 03:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
anybody's uh insurance coverage and I
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
think that's an an opportunity for for
 
03:27:39.830 --> 03:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
the bill to be taken serious advantage
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
of so beside the Privacy issue I think
 
03:27:45.309 --> 03:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
that this is just going to cause a whole
 
03:27:47.030 --> 03:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
lot of problems
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
could could we tweak it we talked about
 
03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:50.590 align:start position:0%
could could we tweak it we talked about
an

03:27:50.590 --> 03:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
an
 
03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment how how would you tweak it I
 
03:27:54.630 --> 03:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
thought we were talking we have an
 
03:27:56.510 --> 03:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
amendment on it no I know we talked
 
03:27:58.189 --> 03:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of just limiting
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
it to claimants as yeah but there's no
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
definition of claimants well can we do
 
03:28:05.229 --> 03:28:05.239 align:start position:0%
both if you want to otherwise I just get
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
rid of
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
it do you really want to tell how much
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
Insurance to a trial
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
order before they even decided case you
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
know you want them to know how much
 
03:28:19.750 --> 03:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
insance you
 
03:28:22.150 --> 03:28:22.160 align:start position:0%
have that's just it the potential for
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
great okay you put it that
 
03:28:31.469 --> 03:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
way well that's the only way I know
 
03:28:36.590 --> 03:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:36.600 --> 03:28:39.429 align:start position:0%
 
umbrella

03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
03:28:39.439 --> 03:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
umbrella
so

03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:46.630 --> 03:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
actually okay
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
all right so the motion is inex being to
 
03:28:49.670 --> 03:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislate any discussion on the motion
 
03:28:53.110 --> 03:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor say I I
 
03:28:56.389 --> 03:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
those opposed so moov
 
03:29:04.189 --> 03:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
hunt Okay and now we're on to
 
03:29:10.349 --> 03:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
liquor so we have a different
 
03:29:10.359 --> 03:29:20.469 align:start position:0%
liquor so we have a different
subcommittee

03:29:20.469 --> 03:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
I thought we I thought we passed more P
 
03:29:25.189 --> 03:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
more than I normally would pass yeah
 
03:29:27.790 --> 03:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but but it's theoretically these
 
03:29:30.590 --> 03:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
bills all been through one body already
 
03:29:32.750 --> 03:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
right and then when you start think when
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
you start looking at itls of bills that
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
went through the Senate you go what the
 
03:29:42.710 --> 03:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.189 --> 03:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
going well they don't do their homor
 
03:29:49.469 --> 03:29:49.479 align:start position:0%
the yeah we probably don't want to get
 
03:29:52.870 --> 03:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
into this discussion do not do motives
 
03:29:55.630 --> 03:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
of the other side you just threw them
 
03:29:57.469 --> 03:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
under the
 
03:30:00.590 --> 03:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
bus under the bus I threw them under the
 
03:30:02.910 --> 03:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
bus we'll have to see how much insurance
 
03:30:02.920 --> 03:30:06.110 align:start position:0%
bus we'll have to see how much insurance
they

03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.670 --> 03:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
have looks like we need one
 
03:30:14.189 --> 03:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
Democrat V okay so we have Pusa C was
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
post we end up doing

amendment and we have an amendment I
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:49.479 --> 03:32:56.349 align:start position:0%
 
is

03:32:56.349 --> 03:32:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:23.229 --> 03:33:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.389 --> 03:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.399 --> 03:33:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
it

03:33:41.429 --> 03:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:33:43.790 --> 03:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
um Kristen did you is there an
 
03:33:46.750 --> 03:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
electronic version of this
 
03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:47.630 align:start position:0%
electronic version of this
I

03:33:47.630 --> 03:33:47.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:33:49.790 --> 03:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
can you
 
03:33:49.800 --> 03:33:53.670 align:start position:0%
can you
go

03:33:53.670 --> 03:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:56.990 --> 03:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
history I can do a quick difference it
 
03:33:59.349 --> 03:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
says the whole bill
 
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%

03:35:19.469 --> 03:35:19.479 align:start position:0%
so the membership of the study group is
 
03:35:21.750 --> 03:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
different the amendment proposes one
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
Senator or three House
 
03:35:26.910 --> 03:35:26.920 align:start position:0%

[Music]

03:35:43.950 --> 03:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
orig we're we're just going over what
 
03:35:48.389 --> 03:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
was changed in the amendment Senate
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
member the
 
03:35:54.030 --> 03:35:54.040 align:start position:0%

03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
member this is too vague okay the
 
03:35:59.830 --> 03:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
meeting put it on the
 
03:36:04.590 --> 03:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
1711 okay and then it's a committee not
 
03:36:17.670 --> 03:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
a commission oh it's a comme it's a
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
committee aiss not a commission because
 
03:36:20.319 --> 03:36:21.510 align:start position:0%
committee aiss not a commission because
commissions

03:36:21.510 --> 03:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
or boo no
 
03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:25.990 align:start position:0%
or boo no
NOS

03:36:25.990 --> 03:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
NOS
 
03:36:29.389 --> 03:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it looks good to me yeah you
 
03:36:31.830 --> 03:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
guys do you get a copy of it here would
 
03:36:34.389 --> 03:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
mine so this is the issue is
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
how how the
 
03:36:43.309 --> 03:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
taxation um we got we got to create a
 
03:36:44.910 --> 03:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
better system because one person is
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
paying 20 6% of the the taxes collected
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
and and yes he's got a dozen stor of
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
locations but he he really should be uh
 
03:36:56.110 --> 03:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
should be a fraction of the overall
 
03:37:00.269 --> 03:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
sales and that uh evidently uh it's a
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's a free-for-all and how this product
 
03:37:05.309 --> 03:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
is coming into New Hampshire unlike
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
tobacco which goes through wholesalers
 
03:37:09.710 --> 03:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
and we regulate them we license them
 
03:37:11.550 --> 03:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
right don't we license those
 
03:37:15.550 --> 03:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
wholesalers so be be prepared that the
 
03:37:18.150 --> 03:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
the end end product is going to be a
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
lure of anybody who is wholesaling in
 
03:37:23.790 --> 03:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I think that's a good
 
03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
idea and I I assume that's what other
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
so no but say the cigarettes is already
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
wholesalers they're already in the
 
03:37:37.229 --> 03:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
business this is this is just going to
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
obviously we're going to try to capture
 
03:37:43.070 --> 03:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
who we're going to try to handle the
 
03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
same thing but I mean that's face it
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing with
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
liquor and you know and beer and you
 
03:37:52.510 --> 03:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
know I mean that's John Hunt's rule of
 
03:37:55.590 --> 03:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
lure that's why we have it when it comes
 
03:37:56.910 --> 03:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
to you know it comes to collecting
 
03:37:58.990 --> 03:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
attacks you you got to license it you
 
03:38:01.030 --> 03:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
got to regulate it and then you can
 
03:38:02.870 --> 03:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
collect the tax have a better system
 
03:38:06.030 --> 03:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
streaming of who's paying the tax so you
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
know the it is interesting to note that
 
03:38:12.189 --> 03:38:12.199 align:start position:0%
one of the uh beer distributors uh uh
 
03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
things that they hold out as being why
 
03:38:17.189 --> 03:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
they s serve an important purpose is
 
03:38:18.510 --> 03:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
that they are the ones that are
 
03:38:20.070 --> 03:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
collecting the beer
 
03:38:23.229 --> 03:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
tax the state and and they actually have
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
it written in the statute that um when
 
03:38:28.950 --> 03:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
they deliver the beer the tax has to be
 
03:38:32.870 --> 03:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
paid within 15 days so nobody caring
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
carrying carrying that and and uh which
 
03:38:39.349 --> 03:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
is a very interesting statute when you
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:38:40.960 --> 03:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
think about
it

03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:38:49.070 --> 03:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
right no it's still 15 days yeah
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:56.429 --> 03:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
days why don't you come over the mic and
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:04.950 --> 03:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman committee
 
03:39:07.269 --> 03:39:07.279 align:start position:0%
members uh Lieutenant Matt Culver from
 
03:39:09.750 --> 03:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State Liquor Commission um
 
03:39:12.189 --> 03:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
and thank you for the question the uh
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
part of the statute that was changed
 
03:39:16.630 --> 03:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
last year representative was when the
 
03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
taxes were
 
03:39:22.750 --> 03:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
due yeah so right 17913 is the limited
 
03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
Credit Law and and the chairman is
 
03:39:28.349 --> 03:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
correct that's uh 15 days
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
after uh the product is sold to retail
 
03:39:34.750 --> 03:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
those invoices are paid to the
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
wholesalers and then the wholesalers pay
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
the commission on a monthly basis of
 
03:39:43.189 --> 03:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
that 30 cents a gallon for that re that
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
sale so yes so representative spe has a
 
03:39:49.990 --> 03:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
question and it may be directed at you
 
03:39:52.269 --> 03:39:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh it it says that section two of this
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
bill which sets up the commission uh
 
03:39:58.189 --> 03:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
takes effect November 1st
 
03:40:01.309 --> 03:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
2024 that's a couple of days before the
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
election so what does that mean in in
