00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
phosphorus

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%

seat and I believe you have a motion to
 
00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:57.070 align:start position:0%

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.070 align:start position:0%
so I would like to move on to pass with
Amendment

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
hb12 motion to okay I would like to make
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
a motion to adopt the amendment uh which
 
00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:18.759 align:start position:0%
is somewhere
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
here uh yes uh Amendment uh z uh
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
224049 4H
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh to uh HB
 
00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
1293 uh and uh you like to speak oh we
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
need a second I would be most pleased to
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
second that motion would you like to
 
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your your Amendment please I
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
would be happy to speak to my Amendment
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
so uh the amendment basically uh retains
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
the intent of the original bill but it
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
reorganizes it in order to fit better
 
00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
into the structure of the chapter uh so
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
um in the original Bill uh everything uh
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
was added to uh section R RSA section uh
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
431 colon
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
4B uh and uh which is uh the section
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
that deals essentially provides the
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority uh for um doing
 
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
registrations for um F phosphate
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
fertilizer that contains phosphate or
 
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
turt turf fertilizer that contains
 
00:08:42.269 --> 00:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
phosphate um and uh 430
 
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:45.880 align:start position:0%
4314 B and also 4 a were put into law
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
back in 2013 with the intention of
 
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
reducing uh nutrient uh runoff into
 
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
water bodies and they those two uh
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
sections just regulate just provide the
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
Authority for registration and uh what
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
can be sold in the State uh so it wasn't
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
really the right place to put the uh a
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
lot of the information in that that came
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
in in uh the original version of 1293
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
because most of what 1293 uh does is it
 
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
provides the uh it
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
provides uh regulation of how uh
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
how fertilizer is applied to Lawns
 
00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
rather than the registration and sale of
 
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.509 align:start position:0%
rather than the registration and sale of
fertilizers

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
fertilizers
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
so uh what I did was I took the um I
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
took the new definitions that were in
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
the uh bill that was given to us I put
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
those into the definitions section of uh
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
431 which is 431 colon 3 and added some
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
more definitions that would be on necess
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to make the bill work
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
I also took out some of the definitions
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
that weren't
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
necessary uh so uh for instance um um Mr
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh so Eric uh satel from the Farm
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau uh mentioned that uh the
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
definition of uh of frozen ground wasn't
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
really necessary because that also
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
appeared in the um in the in the
 
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
language of the Bill of the statute
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
itself so you don't really need to
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
Define it twice
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh so uh what I've done is um
 
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.470 align:start position:0%
uh so uh what I've done is um
essentially

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and and looking at this just came
 
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.110 align:start position:0%
uh and and and looking at this just came
from

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
OLS five minutes ago so I didn't see
 
00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
exactly I haven't had a chance to read
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
over what they did what it looks like
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
like what they did was they provided all
 
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.790 align:start position:0%
like what they did was they provided all
of

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
4313 with the new information in
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
um uh put into the spaces incorrect
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
alphabetical order with the old old
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
definitions there as well which is
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
actually kind of Handy
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
um so that's what's going on with the
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
definitions portion of it uh with uh in
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
let's see on page
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay definitions are a big part of this
 
00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill so uh on page four uh
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
43 uh 431 uh colon
 
00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
4A uh I
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
have um added the uh to the title of
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
that paragraph I've added uh the the
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
word Turf to make to make it clear that
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh this is uh this is just relevant to
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
what's going on to Turf it is not
 
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
relevant to any other agricultural
 
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480 align:start position:0%
purpose uh so uh that that was something
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
that should have happened 10 years ago
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
when uh the bill was originally done but
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
it didn't uh and I did the same thing in
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
431 uh colon 4B uh and the other changes
 
00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:25.910 align:start position:0%
431 uh colon 4B uh and the other changes
uh

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
in uh in 431 a are essentially just to
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
uh make the uh to to make the language a
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more consistent with what uh
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
the um with with app code def AFCO is an
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
organization that does definitions for
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and other nutrient amendments
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
and this this just makes it a little bit
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
more consistent with uh what would be
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
needed for uh uniformity across state
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh in uh 4B I uh added um I I changed
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
things to be uh to so uh the um there's
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
a appco definition for no phosphate
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
fertilizer that is different from what
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
we current what we have in current law
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense to use that uh that
 
00:13:28.829 --> 00:13:28.839 align:start position:0%
um definition that is essentially un
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
form across all the states uh and uh so
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
the that re that afo definition has uh
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
no phosphate is being less than
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
05% phosphate rather than
 
00:13:48.189 --> 00:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
um uh rather than
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
667 what which is what's in current law
 
00:13:55.749 --> 00:13:55.759 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
um and then uh for the fertilizer that's
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
intended for newly established and
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
repaired Lawns that would be what is um
 
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
considered a low phosphate fertilizer uh
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
at in the appco definitions so uh that
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
is um and the numbers there of the 0.25
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
pounds per th square feet uh or and um
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
per application and half a pound per
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
thousand square Fe feet per year that's
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
comes from the appco
 
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.710 align:start position:0%
comes from the appco
definition

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.150 align:start position:0%
definition
um

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
um the next section is um the is a new
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
section which is application of
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
fertilizer uh to Urban Turf and Lawn and
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
urban Turf and Lawn is the appco term
 
00:14:58.749 --> 00:14:58.759 align:start position:0%
that that's used for basically uh any
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
farm and uh
 
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the first paragraph of that is
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
just making it um doubly clear that this
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
does not apply to sod farms and uh golf
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
courses as long as those um operations H
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
are are working within the best
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
management practices that are consistent
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
with what the department has on their
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
website um
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
and and I I talked with the uh a
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative of the Golf Course
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
Association and they
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
essentially uh put together their own
 
00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
best management practices manual in
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the Department using
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
the Department's uh numbers and
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
terminology so uh so that's that is you
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
know that maintains the consistency and
 
00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
they are happy with
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.629 align:start position:0%
that um
so

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh then we get into uh the meat of what
 
00:16:07.829 --> 00:16:07.839 align:start position:0%
can and can't what the restrictions on
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
application are
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
uh the any any fertilizer that is
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
applied to aan uh is uh has to be um one
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
of the ones that's defined within the
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill as a turf fertilizer uh and uh with
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
the appropriate purpose
 
00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759 align:start position:0%
uh and uh there's no application of uh
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
fertilizer shouldn't be applied during
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
heavy rain and uh the um I'm sticking
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
with the number that was in the original
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill which is uh two inches in 24 hours
 
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
bill which is uh two inches in 24 hours
and

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
um and uh the uh rather than saying what
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
the depth of uh frozen ground is it's um
 
00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:58.990 align:start position:0%
the depth of uh frozen ground is it's um
with

00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
in discussions with with various people
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
it sounded like just saying when the
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
ground is Frozen is
 
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
sufficient um and uh then um the other
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
thing is that fertilizer should not be
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
applied when turf grass is not actively
 
00:17:17.429 --> 00:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
growing and that gets us around the
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
question of what should the dates be
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
because uh if we have a variation in
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
what the growing season is because you
 
00:17:26.590 --> 00:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
know we suddenly get March where the
 
00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
whole month is over 80 degrees then the
 
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
grass will start
 
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.830 align:start position:0%
grass will start
growing

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
growing
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
and and uh or conversely if we have a
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
April when the ground is still
 
00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
completely Frozen we don't want to be
 
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
applying it even after April 1 so that
 
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
that was a a suggestion from Mr sautel
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
from the uh Farm Bureau that just um
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
having the uh having it linked to when
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
the when plants are growing is what
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
really is the the determinant um
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
and uh no application to impervious
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
surfaces and I uh if you go back to the
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
definitions impervious surfaces include
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
some things that you probably would
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
never apply fertilizer to like roofs I
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
just took that definition from the
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection act because I
 
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
inconsistent um uh definitions in
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
different parts of of state law
 
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh if you accidentally spill it
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
then you need to re on an impervious
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
surface you need to remove it uh
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
immediately and either put it on the
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
target area or dispose of it
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
properly uh and
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh and I maintained the original bills
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
set back from a storm drain of 25 ft uh
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
and clarified the language there just
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
saying that no fertilizer should be be
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
deposited where it can enter the storm
 
00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:57.310 align:start position:0%
deposited where it can enter the storm
drain

00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
drain
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.710 align:start position:0%
drain
uh

00:18:59.710 --> 00:18:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.549 align:start position:0%
uh
and

00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh consistent with uh the shoreline
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
protection act and the original Bill uh
 
00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:11.559 align:start position:0%
there's a setback from Waters uh is 25
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
feet and that's as defined in the r that
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that definition is also something that
 
00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
is from the original
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
Bill and
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh then uh basically these restrictions
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
apply to anybody who's applying
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh fertilizer to Urban Turf and Lawn uh
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a professional or a
 
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner or um uh yeah um and then the
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
next section is uh the public educ
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
education part the original Bill had
 
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
something about having it separated on
 
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
the store shelves uh so that there would
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
be a separate location for Turf
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
fertilizers with no low or no phosphor
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
phosphorus from other
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
fertilizers uh and that was uh people
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
generally didn't think that was a great
 
00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
idea uh that it was overly prescriptive
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
and what's really important is making
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
sure that there are signs that let
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
people know uh what sort of a fertilizer
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
they should be applying to Lawns and
 
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
what the what the uh proper practices
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
are so um the key part here is is that
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
the department will Design signage that
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh basically addresses all of the
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
application restrictions that are in
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and uh some of the logic
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
behind it in terms of avoiding um
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
excessive fer fertilizer in water bodies
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
and what the dangers that of that could
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
be and then those those signs will be on
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
the department website as PDFs which
 
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.669 align:start position:0%
the department website as PDFs which
retailers

00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
retailers
 
00:20:58.679 --> 00:20:59.870 align:start position:0%
retailers
then

00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
will download and print and post in
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
their fertilizer
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
areas uh
 
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.909 align:start position:0%
areas uh
and

00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
uh uh and that is so in terms of
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement no one's going to be going
 
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
around and checking up on people uh to
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
see if they're applying fertilizer
 
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
correctly we uh that that's just not
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
within either our capabilities or our
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
desires the key part of this bill in
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
terms of helping people uh do it
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
correctly are the signs that are going
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
to be in the fertilizer sections um in
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
in the stores so uh that public Ed
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
education is really key in terms of
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
making this bill work and that's the
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd be happy to answer any
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
just looking at the definition of
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
enhanced efficiency
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and it say means lawn
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
fertilizer products so does that mean
 
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.240 align:start position:0%
that it will say for lawn use on the
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
product because I understand over in on
 
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.669 align:start position:0%
product because I understand over in on
page

00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
four uh section 2 line
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
15 uh no enhanced uh efficiency
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
fertilizer shall be you know at a single
 
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
application rate but I just want to make
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
sure that we're talking about fertilizer
 
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
that is labeled long fertilizer yes so
 
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
that definition comes straight from
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
appco and uh so and uh fertilizer
 
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:38.919 align:start position:0%
manufacturers look to the app code
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
definitions when they're putting
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
together their labels thank you thank
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
please put your um
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
microphone just asking because we have
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
so many um uh substitutes here today
 
00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
that the acronyms will will be uh given
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
in long form for them so they understand
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about sure going
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
forward yes yeah so uh so AFCO I can't
 
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
remember the exact name of it the exact
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
title it's but it's basically the a
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
National Organization made up of
 
00:23:18.269 --> 00:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
Manufacturers and
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
researchers uh that figure out what the
 
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:25.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate um definitions and labels
 
00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
are for uh soil Amendment products uh in
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
order to uh make sure that there's
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
consistency across States so um and I if
 
00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
you really if you're desperate to know
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the what it actually stands for I'm
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
sure Mr Wyman can tell you but um I'm
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
that okay represent
 
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:53.320 align:start position:0%
Penza I have the easiest question so um
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
the ACT shall take effect January 1st
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
2025 is there a reason re why we're
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
out um I think that was that was what
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
was in the original bill and I did not I
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
didn't really think about that part uh
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh one of but one of
 
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
the things that that M that makes sense
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
with that is that um we we need to give
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
retailers enough time to become aware of
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
the law so that they'll know that they
 
00:24:30.909 --> 00:24:30.919 align:start position:0%
need to be posting stuff follow up
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah I understood that because
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
in regards with having the PDFs
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
available for signage and things like
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
that I just thought that it's a long
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
time January 1 versus 60 days but that's
 
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:46.799 align:start position:0%
fine thank you any other comments we
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%

motion so um so uh what this amendment
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
does is it uh replaces the entire bill
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
with uh a study committee and uh the
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
what became clear in the testimony was
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
that uh there was a real problem and the
 
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:19.480 align:start position:0%
solution that was presented in the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
original Bill didn't really address the
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
real problem the real problem is that uh
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
the communities uh around Great Bay uh
 
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
and in the Great Bay Watershed uh and I
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
I think this may be also an issue for
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
other communities in other parts of the
 
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
State uh are having difficulty meeting
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
the requirements of EPA General permits
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
and uh sometimes that re the the
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
recommended um uh fixes from EPA are
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
outside the fiscal capacity of the towns
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
that are being asked to make those um
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
those adjustments uh and even for towns
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
that do and cities that do have a larger
 
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity it's still a substantial
 
00:30:10.149 --> 00:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
burden and in some cases it's not clear
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the uh that the science being used
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
to set those permit requirements is
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily in line with the current
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
conditions on the ground and this is
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
something that uh could probably be
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
handled uh with more agility by uh the
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
state Dees than by the EPA uh there are
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
only three states where these permits
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
are uh are put done by the EPA rather
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
than the state on New Hampshire is one
 
00:30:45.149 --> 00:30:45.159 align:start position:0%
of those Massachusetts is another I'm
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
forgetting what the third was but in
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
almost every state it's the state Dees
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
or equivalent that is figuring out how
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
to do the permitting for these and that
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
allows more flexibility
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of how those permits are
 
00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
structured so I think that we should
 
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:07.320 align:start position:0%
look into having our Dees uh take on
 
00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:09.799 align:start position:0%
this job so that they can really respond
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
to uh what is uh necessary in
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
um uh to have our communities make make
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate adjustments but still but do
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
that within means another part of
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
potentially doing that within means is
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh making more uh
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
more funding available to uh towns and
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
cities to be able to to do these
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
programs once they're determined to be
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
necessary and uh a third a third thing
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
is that there are some uh uh communities
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
in for instance in the lake W Winn pasak
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
Basin that have uh put together uh a
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
joint Waters um treatment uh facility
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
that covers a number of different towns
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
s uh that and they join together and
 
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
that can provide more uh efficiency in
 
00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
terms of uh the dealing with the costs
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
those are all options that uh need to be
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
considered it's something we're not
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
going to not going to figure out before
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
the deadline for this bill so that's why
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
I'm saying we should have a study
 
00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee to look at this um
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and uh so so that's that's what the
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
basically what the study committee will
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
be studying thank you any comments from
 
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.470 align:start position:0%
be studying thank you any comments from
the

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative kraton and
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
then yes Madam chair uh I I seconded
 
00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:37.830 align:start position:0%
then yes Madam chair uh I I seconded
this

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
bill um or this amendment uh because
 
00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:45.799 align:start position:0%
although the bill I thought was not
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
something I would vote for um it
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
definitely highlighted a critical
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
problem within the state of New
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and its relationship with the
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection Agency and that
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
and the fact that
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes their more heavy-handed
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
actions can really hurt the folks in
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
this state um and so I applaud
 
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby who put this
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
together with a deadline of one November
 
00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
uh so this is a tight turn this isn't a
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
push down the road this is uh something
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
where I think we can make a difference
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
in the state um by working together to
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
to come up with reasonable Solutions
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
Penza so this is more of a procedural
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
question because I my I have an
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
amendment as well so I I don't know how
 
00:33:35.269 --> 00:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
this works right
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
so well we I support representative
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
bixby's Amendment my amendment's like
 
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
completely slicing the cat the different
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
way so does your Amendment would it
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate this amendment I don't C yet I
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
think it
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
would represent
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.149 align:start position:0%
would represent
Penza

00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
um if it's a replacement amendment that
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
would replace the bill then it would
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
take away everything that we're
 
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:09.190 align:start position:0%
take away everything that we're
discussing

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.079 align:start position:0%
now I I in in speaking with you about
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
your proposed amendment I believe that
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
um that discussion for what you're
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
proposing could be part of the study
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
committee of what they can be looking at
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
um because you are your Amendment seeks
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
to yeah okay um sorry yeah we should be
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
voting on this and then discussing your
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment but
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm at this point I'm not sure
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
that your Amendment would I think it
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
would replace this particular Amendment
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
as well so okay um any other discussion
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
about this amendment representative
 
00:34:59.069 --> 00:34:59.079 align:start position:0%
Brown yes thank you Mr chairman um the
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
question I have is has da Dees indicated
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
their willingness or ability or their
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts on their ability to do this for
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
the state thank you uh Dees has not
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this it's been a pretty
 
00:35:13.069 --> 00:35:13.079 align:start position:0%
tight turnaround in terms of getting the
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
amendment I I physically got the
 
00:35:18.829 --> 00:35:18.839 align:start position:0%
amendment about um five minutes before
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
this executive session started uh but
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that I an important
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
reason for making this a study committee
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
rather than just saying do this is
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
because uh with a study committee we can
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
bring in Dees and really discuss with
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
them what it would take for them to do
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm I'm sure that they will need
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
more funding to do it uh and and they
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
can but they can explain what that
 
00:35:46.589 --> 00:35:46.599 align:start position:0%
funding would be like uh they can
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
explain uh how this works in other
 
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
states that they that they are cooperate
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
with and they know how the process works
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I the I expect them to be fully
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
involved in the process process of this
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussion okay any other discussion
 
00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.309 align:start position:0%
discussion okay any other discussion
representative

00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair and I I want
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
to Echo representative kon's uh comments
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
a bit and say uh that I think that this
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
was a really nice job on a quick
 
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
turnaround of getting us a bill that
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully can have some impact for
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
residents of some of these towns like
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
you know the the original uh bill was
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
highly problematic for for a lot of
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
reasons uh but I think we all saw that
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
there was a real need there and as you
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
said with a with a really tight
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
turnaround whatever you know if in the
 
00:36:32.829 --> 00:36:32.839 align:start position:0%
end you know Dees says no we really
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
can't do this uh you know that's
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but as you said at least
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're moving in a positive direction to
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
try to do something for folks um so I
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
also applied representative Bixby for
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
his hard work and getting us this
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you there's no other
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
discussion then I would like the uh
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
clerk to call a role uh to vote on this
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you madam chair uh we
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
representative Howard yes represent NAB
 
00:37:35.109 --> 00:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
yes represent moris yes bman yes Madam
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
chair yes 20 amendment is
 
00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
adopted okay and I believe represent
 
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:44.280 align:start position:0%
Penza you have an amendment that you'd
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
motion I don't know what to do right
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
here I'm just gonna be completely honest
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
so you can you can
 
00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:58.630 align:start position:0%
so you can you can
you

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
can yes uh we could uh have a discussion
 
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill in general and then discuss
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
how that um potential Amendment might or
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
might not fit in and then uh without
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
actually moving the amendment
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh so do we hear a motion for
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
1294 no well
 
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if we need to well yeah
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
you want to have the discussion though
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.319 --> 00:38:41.309 align:start position:0%
 
May

00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
May
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so would you like to describe this
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that you your idea yes so it's
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
pretty simple so the um the the prime
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill you know came off
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
you know kind of guns of Blazing about
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
the um you know how we put that forward
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
but it was because of an issue that's
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
been going on in straford County so um
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
which I've heard from multiple
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
constituents first starting in Dober and
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
then of course in Rochester
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
so this amendment basically just
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
corrects the problem that um and it's
 
00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
clear it says in bold towns shall be
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited from entering into a contract
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
that has taxpayer liability including
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
fees or fines without approving such
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
contracts through the normal Municipal
 
00:39:40.309 --> 00:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
budget process so it's as simple as that
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
um that that corrects the that corrects
 
00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:45.079 align:start position:0%
a problem that where everybody was
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
really flipping out because they were
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
going to possibly be on the hook for a
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Rain Tax
 
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
so I don't I don't know how this could
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
be incorporated I'm not really sure sure
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if maybe I could add this
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
to another bill somewhere in our in our
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
genre here the stuff that we're doing
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
but um I think this is important because
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
it immediately puts a correction into a
 
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.589 align:start position:0%
it immediately puts a correction into a
a

00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
problem representative Bixby so I I
 
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
think that um this that this issue in
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
terms of um how the um the town
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
management is not necessarily being
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately constrained by the town um
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh elected body uh is really a question
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
for either the Judiciary Committee or
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
the um Municipal and County government
 
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
committee because uh I I I don't think
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
we have the expert expertise in our
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with this I think that
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
is that um that it is a problem if a
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator or city manager is uh
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
entering into a binding contract without
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
having the Authority for that voted by
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
the the municipal body uh and and and
 
00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
there although there are some you know
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
there are some things that based on the
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
way that the the town Charter or city
 
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Charter is constructed may or may not
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
give permissions and that's something
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
that we just don't know on this
 
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I think what would make
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
sense is to um make this a bill for next
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
term and uh consult with people on um
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate committees who know these
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
things and figure out the best way to
 
00:41:36.839 --> 00:41:38.030 align:start position:0%
things and figure out the best way to
write

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
write
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
it additionally I would think um you
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
might want to talk to the chairs of
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
those two committees and see if there is
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
an appropriate bill that they have
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
pending that you may be able to put this
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment attach it
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
to right yeah just one line so okay okay
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other
 
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
comments okay um why don't we proceed
 
00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:08.079 align:start position:0%

R14 and do I hear a second M
 
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Howard Madam chair I
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
second the the motion thank you um
 
00:43:53.829 --> 00:43:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative kraton do you would you
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion I yes ma'am
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
the uh as as we heard testimony and
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
talked that about this bill to me it
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
struck me that
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh environment is hugely important to
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire in fact in it
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
it's embedded into the mission statement
 
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Environmental
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
Services and the things that we listen
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
to and and uh discuss every day have
 
00:44:27.069 --> 00:44:27.079 align:start position:0%
relevant importance to the environment
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
um but I don't think this bill enhances
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
our ability to care for the environment
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
any more than if we did without it and
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
so uh as we looked at it I I thought
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
that this was uh not having the intended
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
effect of improving our environment uh
 
00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
rather it was uh it was getting lost in
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
in another document and so uh I stand by
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
the dees mission statement which is to
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
protect our environment and I just
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
reread it and it's straight up in the
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
first sentence and so I I would stand by
 
00:45:04.589 --> 00:45:04.599 align:start position:0%
what what we're doing and continue to to
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
do great things I don't think we need a
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
cacr to do that over thank you
 
00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
representative vix so
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
um I am not entirely opposed to the idea
 
00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
of having um a something in the
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution that explicitly says that
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh marks the value of the environment to
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
the state of New h but I don't think
 
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
that this uh particular amendment is the
 
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
one that does it so uh I will be voting
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
I thank you representative
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
ger thank you very much Madam chair I
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to oppose the itl motion uh
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns we have is about
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
kind of how vague the language is but
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
all fundamental rights are vague if we
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
this committee if we had right now the
 
00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
First Amendment or the Second Amendment
 
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the United States Constitution in
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
front of us for the very first time we
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
would say this is vague how do you
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
define arms what are the limitations how
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
far do the rights apply at what point
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
are they infringed the New Hampshire
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution says that every child in
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
the state has the right to an adequate
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
education we've been litigating that for
 
00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
a long time does that mean because it's
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
a vague statement does that mean because
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't been able to find a solution
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't believe that children in
 
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
the state do have a fundamental right to
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
an adequate education I don't think so
 
00:46:25.359 --> 00:46:26.309 align:start position:0%
an adequate education I don't think so
all

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental statements of rights are
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
vague by definition and then what
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
happens is through government
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
representative government we litigate
 
00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we legislate in order to determine
 
00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
how those fundamental rights are
 
00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:41.960 align:start position:0%
actually applied and realized and
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
protected in society but the purpose for
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
putting them in these foundational
 
00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
documents is to make a statement that
 
00:46:50.109 --> 00:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
they are exactly that that they are
 
00:46:50.119 --> 00:46:53.950 align:start position:0%
they are exactly that that they are
foundational

00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
rights uh we weren't
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
any of us born being able to speak and
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
yet we have a First Amendment that
 
00:47:03.069 --> 00:47:03.079 align:start position:0%
guarantees our right to the freedom of
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
speech and certainly none of us were
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
born with a gun in our hands and yet we
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
have a second amendment that protects
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
our constitutional right to bear arms
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
each and every one of us was born
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
needing to be able to breathe clean air
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
and drink clean water and eat produce
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
that comes from clean land so as far as
 
00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned there simply is no more
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental right than the right to a
 
00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
clean and healthy environment and I
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
understand and recognize my colleague
 
00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
representative kulan who had who said
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
during our discussion that it's as he
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
sees it this is kind of a placeholder
 
00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:37.950 align:start position:0%
sees it this is kind of a placeholder
for

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits yeah we've spent more than 200
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
years with lawsuits over the first and
 
00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
second amendments and other aspects of
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights there's scarcely a
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental right outlined in the United
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
States or the New Hampshire state
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
constitution that has not been the
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
subject of further clarification through
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
legislation or challenges through
 
00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
litigation uh so as I said uh among the
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
many rights that we recognized as being
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely fundamental I don't believe
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
that there is one more fundamental than
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the right that is uh that this cacr
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
proposes that we enshrine in the State
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution and for that reason I
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
oppose the uh the itl and and look
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
forward to uh fighting for it on the
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
floor thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
any other representative sopak kitis I
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
think that um we do a disservice to um
 
00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
the after Generations from where we live
 
00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:39.160 align:start position:0%
now when we don't make a statement
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
of where we feel on things and I think
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
that a cacr is that we have um given the
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
youth an environment that's
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
teetering and how I explain it to the
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
youth is that they're the people that
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
have to go along after the parade and
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
clean up the elephant poop and they are
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to have huge work ahead of them
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be sitting right on
 
00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
our shoulders and they will say what did
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
you do for us to help us through this
 
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
and this cacr is a mission St statement
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
it's a mission statement that we
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
recognize that there are
 
00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues I live in nsha just north of
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
nashwa is marac marac is a cancer
 
00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:41.599 align:start position:0%
cluster marac has um it's
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater is
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
contaminated it's got this beautiful
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
plant St gobain that was recruited there
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
from Vermont because Vermont showed them
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
the door because they liked our lack of
 
00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
the door because they liked our lack of
regulations

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
more and they have BL we have the
 
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
highest bladder cancer in the country
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that cancer belt goes
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
from marac all the way over to the coast
 
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.829 align:start position:0%
from marac all the way over to the coast
and

00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I just find I'm going to support this
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
um a toath I'll vote against the itl
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
because it's a mission
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
statement representative H Haskins thank
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I too will oppose the
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
itl for the reasons that my colleagues
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
have stated I I think it's an important
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
message to send I look forward to
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
working on it and supporting it um and I
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
hope we get the chance to make that
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:51.640 align:start position:0%

uh who want to send out a mission
 
00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
statement and have it you know
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
emboldened in our constitution I however
 
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
I believe that the inelegance of the
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
language limits the efficacy of the of
 
00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment so thank
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%

00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
of components to to this it's a very
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
complicated Bill the thought is that the
 
00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
way we should and and this is
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislation uh model legislation that's
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
come from another
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
organization uh a National
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
Organization and the thought is that the
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
way we should attack uh epr in the state
 
00:54:23.789 --> 00:54:23.799 align:start position:0%
is through smaller pieces we we have um
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
bills that are dealing with with Banning
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries we have uh bills that
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
are talking about um bottle return and
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
we have other bills that deal with other
 
00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
issues having to do with recycling or
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
how what are we putting in our landfill
 
00:54:47.549 --> 00:54:47.559 align:start position:0%
so I think we are already addressing epr
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
in several smaller pieces which makes
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
sense because there's not a one-size
 
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
fits-all um to this to this issue and
 
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
that is why I am not in favor of this
 
00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.589 align:start position:0%
that is why I am not in favor of this
particular

00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
Bill any other further comments
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so um I was uh I
 
00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
was sort of hoping to to have this as an
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
interim study bill as opposed to uh an
 
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
itl because I think that uh we really
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
need to study uh this as a um I I think
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
that we can't just
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh wait until wait for another uh uh
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
term to go by before coming up with uh
 
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
with some sort of solid legislation that
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
we can submit next term and this is
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
really complicated and I think that um
 
00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.390 align:start position:0%
really complicated and I think that um
that

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh although um representative parshall
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
did look at some model legislation he
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
actually spent a lot of time
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh trying to uh mold his bill uh to
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
address more things than was in any
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
piece of model legislation that was
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
there uh I don't uh unfortunately I
 
00:56:12.190 --> 00:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
don't think that his bill is is as
 
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
written is workable uh and I think part
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
of the problem was that he was pretty
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
much doing it on his own this is uh this
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
is something that really requires more
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
than one person working on it with many
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders coming in to uh uh to help
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
us uh put together a bill that will work
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
I think that uh when we had the um the
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative from the Plastic industry
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
in last week and I I thank Madam chair
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
for uh having uh in invited that
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
presentation uh one of the things that
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
became clear was that it might make more
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
sense to rather than to say all
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
packaging to say let's focus on one
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
sector and uh so perhaps an epr bill
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
that uh just PL just focuses on the
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
Plastics sector and we can get
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Plastics
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
industry we can get representatives from
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
the uh uh conservation law Foundation we
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
can get uh representatives from uh Dees
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
from there a whole range of stakeholders
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
to help us figure out how to put
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
together a more targeted epr bill but we
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
need to be working on it and uh there
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
are two avenues for working on that uh
 
00:57:43.150 --> 00:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
one is uh that we could do this as an
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
interim study the other is that we could
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
in fact do an ad hoc uh series of
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings uh in order to
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
meet that same goal and that in fact in
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
fact may give us more flexibility than a
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
than a um than a interm study so um as
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
long as we really commit to doing those
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
ad hoc sessions I'd be willing to
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
support the itl but I think that we
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to study this and have a
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation prepared for next
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
term yeah representative Bixby I would
 
00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
be totally amable
 
00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
to an itl on this bill and then uh
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
having our subcommittees work on pieces
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
of uh epr legislation I think that would
 
00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:34.160 align:start position:0%
be prudent as an ad hoc as opposed to an
 
00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
interim study representative Murray
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I although my
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
preference might be more for the interim
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
study I will um support the commitment
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
to an ad hoc committee because I do
 
00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
agree um we've talked for years now
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
about extended producer responsibility
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
and how that fits into the framework uh
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
and we heard folks uh who did give the
 
00:58:59.549 --> 00:58:59.559 align:start position:0%
presentation last time that uh they
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
recognized that that's an integral part
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
of how recycling functions not only uh
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
in the United States but elsewhere
 
00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:10.880 align:start position:0%
across the globe and uh to not have that
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
considered um and worked on while um I
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
agree there are problems with this
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
current bill um we absolutely have to
 
00:59:23.349 --> 00:59:23.359 align:start position:0%
look at epr agree anyone else
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.789 --> 00:59:30.799 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am I I agree completely that
 
00:59:34.349 --> 00:59:34.359 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of plastics and
 
00:59:38.349 --> 00:59:38.359 align:start position:0%
waste at this at the at the Inception
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
point is important I'd be willing to
 
00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
assist with the subcommittee effort uh
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
one of the things about this bill that
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
that jumped out of me was that it the
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
cost of eight
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
Personnel uh is pushing a million bucks
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
which is not currently in the budget and
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
and I think that if we're going to pass
 
00:59:59.549 --> 00:59:59.559 align:start position:0%
a bill that as other colleagues have
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
stated is not exactly what we want and
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend a million bucks on
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
it I think that is is uh not responsible
 
01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:08.839 align:start position:0%
um but I do believe that working
 
01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.039 align:start position:0%
together we can figure out some way to
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
get the pieces and parts of this that
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
are important into the next session
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ger thank you
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh I support interim study
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
as I did when we discussed this before a
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
very distant second would be the ad hoc
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
commit and I certainly would be uh very
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
happy to to help out with the work of
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
that committee uh and I will certainly
 
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
oppose itl thank you thank you
 
01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative smart you had your hand
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
up no oh no I didn't oh representative
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
Duty uh yes thank you madam chair uh
 
01:00:41.309 --> 01:00:41.319 align:start position:0%
first of all with all due respect I
 
01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
think we have a number of bills that
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
come before our committee that are based
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
on model legislation and I think today
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
we will probably be voting on at least
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
two other bills that were based on model
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
legislation so I would certainly
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
you know um not want to not consider a
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
bill because of that um secondly I agree
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
with my um colleagues um that this is an
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
extremely important issue I would say
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
partializing uh but on the other hand I
 
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:20.599 align:start position:0%
also think because we've seen so many
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
epr bills come through and a lot of them
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
basically have the same administrative
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
structure uh which means a producer
 
01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility organization that
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
collects fees from um producers people
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
who produce the trash that
 
01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have to pay for I think
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
basically we should be thinking in a you
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
know more uh broad scope in terms of
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
possibly having a department or a
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
division under one of our departments
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
handles uh producer responsibility
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
partializing a uh interim study
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
committee we can bring all the people
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
forward for it so I would be voting
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
else oh sure go ahead representative ger
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
you had something to add well yeah just
 
01:02:29.390 --> 01:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
because with representative Duty
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
referring to the fact that this is model
 
01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
legislation it reminded me of something
 
01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to say when we had the
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and that is uh it's not
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily bad when we have model
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislation we tend to use that as if
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
it's a negative term but in this
 
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
particular case one of the things that
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
we've talked a lot about is if something
 
01:02:48.190 --> 01:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
like this is going to be successful it's
 
01:02:51.069 --> 01:02:51.079 align:start position:0%
going to have to be part of a regional
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
plan right and it's ultimately going to
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
have to be part of a a national plan and
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
the only way to move in that direction
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
actually is for several states to be
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
working from the same basic model
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
legislation so we have similar
 
01:03:04.109 --> 01:03:04.119 align:start position:0%
definitions similar understandings of
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
the processes so I just did want to
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
thank representative Duty for making
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
that comment because it reminded me that
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
I had wanted to to say that during the
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you okay thank you um with
 
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
that I would like the clerk to call the

to The Organic certification program do
 
01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
I hear a motion representative kulan
 
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to move
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
itl on hb1
 
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
184 do I hear a second um I I second
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
that thank you would you like to um
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion representative
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
kolan I I'd love to um first thing I
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
want to say is that I know everyone on
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
this committee supports organic farming
 
01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:12.839 align:start position:0%
and we all think and believe that they
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
provide real value and enrich the soil
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the air and all the elements um
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
however when we also talk about organic
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
farming uh we talk about sustainability
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
a lot and we've been told by the
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner that this plan um this
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
program is unsustainable and will never
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
be uh financially sustainable we also
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
see an organic um migration away from
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
State uh certifiers and we also know
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
that uh there's multiple other options
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
for Organic certification so no one is
 
01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
being left out in the cold so to speak
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
so while some of us on
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
um some of us in our caucus you know we
 
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
think you know we maybe we should just
 
01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:07.480 align:start position:0%
let this go but the thing is is that um
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
if we stick to our principles we know
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
that subsidies they compound and they uh
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
snowball over time so we don't think
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire taxpayers should
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
be left on the hook for this program so
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
for that reason um
 
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
I move itl today represent Bixby so um I
 
01:06:34.269 --> 01:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
would oppose the itl and uh one of the
 
01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
things that uh is important to remember
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
in this process is that back in the
 
01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:46.359 align:start position:0%
1990s it was the our Department of
 
01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
Agriculture approached the organic
 
01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
community and said we can do this for
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
you and to
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh back out of that suddenly is a real
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
problem now it is possible that the
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
long-term resolution for this is to move
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
it more towards a private uh
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
organization doing the
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
certification but we don't it would be a
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
real disservice to our organic certified
 
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
organic community in the state of New
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to suddenly pull out pull all
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
the funding away from this
 
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:27.559 align:start position:0%
and uh leave them without an option in
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
the short term uh there are discussions
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
that are happening with NOA New
 
01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:35.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh other certifying bodies
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
in the area that could could create a
 
01:07:41.789 --> 01:07:41.799 align:start position:0%
satellite program where there would be
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
it would be possible to have New
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire organic crops and uh and
 
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
animal products and uh um and uh value
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
added products labeled as produced in
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with a New Hampshire uh
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
with with a New
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Organic
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
certification uh label that is also
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
certified by a out of another
 
01:08:14.589 --> 01:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
organization uh like one of one of the
 
01:08:19.269 --> 01:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
existing or um uh accredited uh aca's um
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
accredited certifying uh
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
agencies uh but it's going to take it's
 
01:08:26.789 --> 01:08:26.799 align:start position:0%
going to take some time to get that
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
program together and we need to support
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
our uh our farmers in the interim so uh
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is not going to be
 
01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
something we're going to be funding
 
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
forever but it's something that we need
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
to fund in the short term in order to
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
give our organic farmers uh time to uh
 
01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
develop a better option and uh it is
 
01:08:57.709 --> 01:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
part of allowing our Department of
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
Agriculture to uh maintain that
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
commitment that they made a number of
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
years ago that they would help our
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
organic community so I I see that bring
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
taking the funding suddenly is a uh is a
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
real uh disservice it is a um turning
 
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
back on a uh commitment that was made by
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
the department and I am completely
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
completely against it however uh one
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
thing that
 
01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:32.759 align:start position:0%
um that the uh representative from the
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
Farm Bureau brought up uh uh was the
 
01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
possibility of a sunset uh if we
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl then I'd be willing I I
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
have an amendment that would place a
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
sunset on on on the positions and uh I'd
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
be happy to bring that forward if given
 
01:09:52.669 --> 01:09:52.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity represent Murray thank
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and if I May while we're
 
01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
having this discussion for the record
 
01:09:58.510 --> 01:09:58.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the letter that we received
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
from the Farm Bureau this morning um
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
regarding their position on Organic
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
certification uh by damp and I just
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that that was clear
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
to folks I think we all receive the
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
letter yeah I just just summarize sure
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
so um for those um it the Farm Bureau
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
starts uh addressing it to the chair and
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee and in the
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
second paragraph says that we want to
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
make clear that the F Bureau policy
 
01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
support stamp providing USDA organic
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
certification Services provided the
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
program is self-funded it f further goes
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
on uh and and talks about uh
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
organizations outside of the State of
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but then also uh notes
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
that for reasons that we have outlined
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
within this document we believe the
 
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
program is important enough to give it a
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
real shot to succeed since stamp uh made
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders aware in the summer of 2021
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
of the issues it was facing with the
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
program we do not believe it has been
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
given that
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you I'd like to add
 
01:11:00.669 --> 01:11:00.679 align:start position:0%
though that
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
um they don't support having a program
 
01:11:05.790 --> 01:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
you just read that they don't support
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
having the program if it's not self
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
self-funded and what we're hearing from
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is that it won't ever
 
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.830 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is that it won't ever
be

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:11:18.149 --> 01:11:18.159 align:start position:0%
self-funded um especially based on the
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
amount of personnel they're going to
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
need uh in their Department to do that
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
that's where my problem is with this
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
belt is that
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
um right
 
01:11:35.350 --> 01:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
now the cost well the cost for an
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
organic farmer to get certified through
 
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.430 align:start position:0%
organic farmer to get certified through
New

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Department of Agriculture
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
is pretty
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and if only 66 Farms right
 
01:11:50.189 --> 01:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
now are availing themselves of this I
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
can imagine that it would be even less
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
with the fees going up up which it would
 
01:11:58.950 --> 01:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
have to uh even with the subsidies so
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm just not convinced that this
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
is um this is going to be a good program
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
chair and I think when we're talking
 
01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719 align:start position:0%
about uh this program being uh
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
self-funding we've already seen even
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
though New Hampshire certific Organic
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
certification is less expensive than the
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
other certifying agencies half of the or
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
certified organic farms have already
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
left the state
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
program representative
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
Howard um the letter also goes on
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
besides saying that having a sunset
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
um uh on the on the on the bill they um
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
he also suggests that that they use that
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
time to become self-sufficient um I
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
think that uh I think that we need to
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
give it a shot we need to give them a
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
chance to to come around and I think
 
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that that those other
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
the other half of is because the the
 
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
state no longer does um meet or anything
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
other than crops so I think the people I
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
I would guess that the people who have
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
dropped out probably were didn't you
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
know needed greater coverage than the
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
state provides representative
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you ma'am I'm just looking
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
at my notes and and
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
essentially uh I agree with uh
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
representative kulon that organic
 
01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:29.239 align:start position:0%
farming is critical to the the viability
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture on the state but the the
 
01:13:34.669 --> 01:13:34.679 align:start position:0%
numbers are what what hit me it's a
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
$220,000 bill that supports roughly 66
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
farms and so if it's to be self-
 
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
sustaining then you're talking about at
 
01:13:50.709 --> 01:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
least $45,000 per Farm to to have this
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
process unless you get money from
 
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but that that's not in
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
the bill and so if we're if we're going
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
to the farmers and we're saying hey we
 
01:14:02.790 --> 01:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
got this great program for you it's
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
going to cost you 4,000 bucks good luck
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
to you I'm not sure we're doing them any
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
favors and so there may be a better way
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
to do this but if the if they're going
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
in pres premises it's
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
self-funding then I think that this is
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
not the bill to get that done over thank
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
you representative Duty yes thank you
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh I think argument can be
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
made um that uh the organic farmers
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
received a disservice uh through the uh
 
01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
through the management of this program
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
because uh the fees have never been um
 
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
raised so therefore we're in a situation
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
now where they're unrealistically low uh
 
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:44.440 align:start position:0%
in comparison and and I think the
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
department should take some
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility for that the other thing
 
01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
I have an issue with uh is the term
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
subsidy uh I would suspect that there's
 
01:14:56.629 --> 01:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of programs in uh damp that are
 
01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:58.360 align:start position:0%
subsidized I mean the one that I can
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
think of is the invasive species program
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure that that's funded by
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
any industry um so you could call that a
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
subsidy also but I mean it's part of
 
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
their work the third problem that I have
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
is that commissioner Jasper came to this
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
session the legislature has a
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility to budget for each
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
department okay we expect that budgeted
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
money to be used in service of the
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
environment and Agriculture and we were
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
told by commissioner Jasper that he
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
returns money every year to the general
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
fund so 20
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
$220,000 which is probably maximum
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
because you know the fee should be
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
raised we all understand that I don't
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
think that's unreasonable and I
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
certainly don't I don't think it's
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to pass an amendment that
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
gives gives us three years to look at
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
this and see if it can be
 
01:15:52.199 --> 01:15:55.149 align:start position:0%
this and see if it can be
feasible

01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
01:15:56.669 --> 01:15:56.679 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
moris thank you madam chair um I'm going
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
to vote against the itl um and hope that
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
we can support um representative
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
bigsby's Amendment um so that we can
 
01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
have some extra time to look at this and
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
see how we can make it uh viable moving
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
forward and I would just like to point
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
out that um even though we're only
 
01:16:17.790 --> 01:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
talking about 66 Farms we're also
 
01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
talking about 66 communities and the
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
impact that um these Farms have on the
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
economy and you know the the resources
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
that they provide to those to those
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
people so for me when I'm thinking about
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
our job in the government and
 
01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.030 align:start position:0%
our job in the government and
$220,000

01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
$220,000
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
um I I feel that it's a good investment
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
but I also think that you know it's
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
worth exploring additional ways that
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
they can become at least more self-
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
sustainable over the next few years
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I appreciate your
 
01:16:49.679 --> 01:16:51.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I appreciate your
comments

01:16:51.030 --> 01:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I I I will will get to you I I do
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
recall uh that commissioner Jasper did
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
say that he didn't believe that if this
 
01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
bill was not passed that it would harm
 
01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Farm uh organic farmers so
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to take that into mind too
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for allowing me
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
to speak again I I I would also like to
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
say that I think that um investing in
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
organic farming gives consumers also
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
another choice and I think that the
 
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:28.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
um deserves that opportunity to have
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
both of those options available in the
 
01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:34.760 align:start position:0%
farming Community for all of the reasons
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
we've talked about supporting um
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
communities supporting the farmers um
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
and I also am eager to see
 
01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:43.159 align:start position:0%
representative bixby's Amendment come
 
01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
forward so I will be voting against the
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
itl okay so why don't I instruct the
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on itl motion uh
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
for HB
 
01:17:56.790 --> 01:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
1184 thank you madam chair the motion is
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%

01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh 202
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
24-4 77h to uh HB
 
01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
1184 and I'd like to speak to my motion
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
second would you like to speak to your
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
motion representative Bixby yes please
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you madam chair so uh what
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment does is it uh adds a
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
contingency to the bill so
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that uh if it if at the year at the end
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
of the year uh ending in uh end of the
 
01:19:38.669 --> 01:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh ending June 30th
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
2027 uh the commission determines that
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh insufficient revenues uh are have
 
01:19:49.149 --> 01:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
been generated by the fees for the pro
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
for the program uh then uh the two
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
positions that the bill creates will be
 
01:19:59.470 --> 01:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
terminated so uh what that does is that
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
um the the way that this works in terms
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
of budgeting the fir in the um in the
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
bill there is
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
$222,000 for two positions plus uh a car
 
01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
and computers for uh that for those
 
01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:20.679 align:start position:0%
people to do the work uh
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
and that that fun fing will be for
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
2025 and the uh the next year is a
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
budget year so uh so 26 and 27 would be
 
01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
under the budget that we approved for
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
next term the commissioner would have to
 
01:20:43.550 --> 01:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh put in his budget request the
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
salaries for those two positions uh that
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
would be less than the
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
$220,000 because uh it doesn't include
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
the equipment and that equipment will be
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
still good for for for the following
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
years uh so uh we're probably looking at
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the 150 to $180,000 range
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh per year in the next budget that the
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner will ha will have
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
to request though that for his budget uh
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
unless there is something that comes up
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
that says that uh well actually I'm get
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'll get to that un last on next after
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
after I talk about how the amendment
 
01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:34.199 align:start position:0%
works so uh if at the end of 2020 uh if
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
in June of
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
2027 insufficient funds have come in
 
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
through fees to pay for those two
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
positions then these the positions will
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
automatically terminate and they'll the
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner will not be required at
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
any point in the future to request re
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
EST funding for those
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
positions now if something comes up uh
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of fiscal year
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
2025 and the commissioner determines
 
01:22:05.350 --> 01:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
that it really is impossible to make
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
this program continue he can put in his
 
01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
budget request no money for the
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
positions and language for hb2 saying
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
that those positions would be would be
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
terminated so the what uh so what this
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
amendment does does is it creates a hard
 
01:22:27.470 --> 01:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
stop that the commissioner does not have
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
any control over if the money doesn't
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
come in through fees uh to to completely
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
fund those two
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
positions uh but it does not that does
 
01:22:40.229 --> 01:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
not prevent the commissioner from
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
determining before then that maybe this
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
really isn't working uh so uh what we're
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
really committing to is just the
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
$220,000 for the coming year uh the
 
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
coming fiscal year and that is well
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
invested in terms of giving the organic
 
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
Community time to put together a um a
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
program that uh will better uh uh better
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
function for New Hampshire's organic
 
01:23:21.149 --> 01:23:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
Penza I would like to understand the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
money so I know you just explained that
 
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
but I just I want it as simple as
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
possible so this 2024 is when it's going
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
to at the end of 2024 is when um it's
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
the program would be in a sense
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
dissolved so we're looking at
 
01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
25 and 26 and then this is 27 so you're
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
saying that it would only be 220 it
 
01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.470 align:start position:0%
saying that it would only be 220 it
wouldn't

01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
be uh well actually if it's half of a
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
year so it wouldn't be um 440 then plus
 
01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:01.870 align:start position:0%
year so it wouldn't be um 440 then plus
another

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
110,000 for a half a year so
 
01:24:09.790 --> 01:24:09.800 align:start position:0%
500 okay 50,000 is what I'm looking at
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
for a number may may I clarify sure okay
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
so um the the fiscal the fiscal years
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
are go from June from the end of June to
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
the end of June uh so uh fiscal year uh
 
01:24:27.990 --> 01:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
25 starts on
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I it's get because it goes July 1
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
July starts July
 
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
1st of 2024 so and then ends uh July
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
June 30th of
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
2025 and uh so the money that the the
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
$220,000 that is appropriated in the
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill will cover uh July 24 through June
 
01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.229 align:start position:0%
bill will cover uh July 24 through June
2025

01:24:57.229 --> 01:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
and the um we need to have and then in
 
01:25:05.310 --> 01:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
order to have any money further it needs
 
01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
to be part of the Department's budget
 
01:25:14.229 --> 01:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
request so uh when the uh so uh if the
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
if the commissioner determines that the
 
01:25:20.229 --> 01:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
program should continue then he will put
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
in a request for one and a half
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
positions and that's ballpark 150
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
160,000 I depend I don't remember the
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
exact numbers from the fiscal node in
 
01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
terms of what the positions were and
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
what the material was uh but uh that
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
would be uh per year so that would be uh
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
if he puts that budget request in it
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
would be um about 300 a little bit over
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
300,000 for the following fiscal year if
 
01:25:55.709 --> 01:25:55.719 align:start position:0%
that gets passed in the budget uh
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh and that is the maximum
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
that we would possibly be out uh and
 
01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's going to be offset by fees the
 
01:26:09.109 --> 01:26:09.119 align:start position:0%
department is going to be raising fees
 
01:26:13.070 --> 01:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the uh for next year not for this
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
com not for the current growing season
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
but for the next growing season so uh
 
01:26:19.350 --> 01:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
there'll be a certain amount of onset
 
01:26:22.709 --> 01:26:22.719 align:start position:0%
from fees that would go against whatever
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
is budgeted for uh the next FIS fiscal
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
year okay um in a minute um so thank you
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
for that representative Bixby but uh the
 
01:26:37.629 --> 01:26:37.639 align:start position:0%
way I'm hearing this is that there seems
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of ifs and buts that come
 
01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
along with this um Amendment and we have
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
no assurances of whether this is going
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
to work or
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
not with the prospect of fees absolutely
 
01:26:56.109 --> 01:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
going to have to go up I'm expecting
 
01:26:57.830 --> 01:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be even less
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
participation than the 66 organic
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
farmers that we currently have so that
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
is why I'm thinking that um I I I think
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
um I'd vote against an otpa
 
01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.310 align:start position:0%
um I'd vote against an otpa
representative

01:27:15.310 --> 01:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
Penza that's exactly what I was just
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to say so in kind of going based
 
01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
upon what representative Duty said right
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we go from a very minimal fees that
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
these people are expecting and then they
 
01:27:31.709 --> 01:27:31.719 align:start position:0%
get hit all in one time so it could be
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
increased by you know a few thousand
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
dollars so then we have you know the
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
program bleeds these
 
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
Farmers I don't know I just I don't
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
think that this I just don't think that
 
01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
it's well thought out and this is
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
probably one of the hardest bills
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm so supportive of this
 
01:27:51.669 --> 01:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
community I spend all of the extra money
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
to buy all those kinds of produce
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
locally as well and so I just think that
 
01:27:57.910 --> 01:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's a better way and I I just don't
 
01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
believe that this is it representative
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
Howard I think it could go just the
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
opposite direction as well if if we were
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
to um create If This Were to spin-off of
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
a private certification agency that is
 
01:28:16.270 --> 01:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
that is housed in New Hampshire it could
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
draw New Hampshire Farms back in and
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
create an economy of scale because if
 
01:28:23.950 --> 01:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
you're growing in in New Hampshire isn't
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
it better to be certified in New
 
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:28.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
comto thank you Madame
 
01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.910 align:start position:0%
comto thank you Madame
chair

01:28:32.910 --> 01:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
um I agree this is tough right we wanton
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
our organic certified Farms but we do
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
know that we have half of our certified
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
crop farms already being certified
 
01:28:48.109 --> 01:28:48.119 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we also heard the commissioner
 
01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
state that currently he only has one I
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
believe it was one organic
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
certifier right now if that person
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
leaves the program
 
01:29:03.390 --> 01:29:03.400 align:start position:0%
fails and I also believe that he said to
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
train a person it will take up to
 
01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.470 align:start position:0%
train a person it will take up to
18

01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
months so if we hired someone and got
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
them up to Snuff it's a year and a half
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
out and I could be wrong but that's what
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
I thought he said representative Murray
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I also want to
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're not losing sight of
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that we do have a sort of
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative agreement um
 
01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
through um the USDA Farm Service Agency
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
around Organic certification cost
 
01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.229 align:start position:0%
around Organic certification cost
sharing

01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursements um so there is some of
 
01:29:41.149 --> 01:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
that that will help offset the costs to
 
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
organic farmers as well um that they can
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
apply for and I I just didn't want that
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
to be um represent Bixby yeah I just
 
01:29:53.830 --> 01:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to clarify um what what the uh what
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
the status of Organic certification um
 
01:29:59.550 --> 01:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the department is right now
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
right now we have two people who are
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
fully certified and uh and and working
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
and we have another person who is uh
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
approaching the end of her training and
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
will very soon be certified and what the
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner wanted in terms of
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh having certified um
 
01:30:26.830 --> 01:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
Personnel available and uh and sort
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
of uh existing as positions and statute
 
01:30:33.470 --> 01:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
was to in order to make sure that he
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
would have a buffer in case someone left
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
he'd always have someone available to uh
 
01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
to fill in those shoes so uh it's it so
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
so right now there is not a an impending
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
crisis of someone leaving unless three
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
people leave all at once representative
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
com uh thank you madam chair and this is
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
just a question for represent Bixby I
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
don't know if you know that so currently
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
we have three
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
people that will go out to 66 farms uh
 
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
to certify them organically is that what
 
01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:09.189 align:start position:0%
to certify them organically is that what
you're

01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
saying um what I'm saying is that we
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
have three people who are qualified and
 
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh are recognized by the USDA as
 
01:31:23.350 --> 01:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
certifiers and they do not spend most of
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
their their time doing that uh so I
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
think there is one of them that does
 
01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
that is spending most of her time doing
 
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
that the other two do it on a uh do it
 
01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
part-time as needed to fill in the gaps
 
01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:39.239 align:start position:0%
when that one person uh it
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
has when that one that one workload is
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
too much so I think in terms of the
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
actual amount of work that is uh
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
required for uh the certification uh I
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
think that is essentially one and a half
 
01:31:58.510 --> 01:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
full-time uh people's worth of work and
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
most of the work is not going out to the
 
01:32:03.709 --> 01:32:03.719 align:start position:0%
farm and inspecting most of the work is
 
01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the paperwork filed by
 
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
those Farms making sure that they uh
 
01:32:13.709 --> 01:32:13.719 align:start position:0%
that they're consistent with the program
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
requirements and uh if there are
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies letting those Farmers
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
know that they need to address those Inc
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
consistencies uh I I think if we want to
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
have more detail about how that time is
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
spent uh we could probably ask uh
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
director Wyman but I'm not sure that's a
 
01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
good use of our time I think we know
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
where this is going and we probably want
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
to move on towards a vote Yes I I would
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
um yes sir uh may ask would it be
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
possible for the committee to have a a
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
very short break to step away to do for
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
a few minutes because we still have a
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
few more bills to go through and I think
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
some folks could uh use a short break um
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay U I would recess for three minutes

you madam chair um although this uh bill
 
01:41:00.910 --> 01:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
was well-intentioned um it would
 
01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.910 align:start position:0%
was well-intentioned um it would
mandate

01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
um that the Department of Agriculture
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
enter into a cooperate agreement with uh
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
the uni
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
USDA and that they
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
shall have a certification program for
 
01:41:20.159 --> 01:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
shall have a certification program for
all

01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.990 --> 01:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
um farming whether it be Dairy meat crop
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of the taxpayers is over a
 
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars I believe per year for
 
01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:34.950 align:start position:0%
million dollars I believe per year for
this

01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.350 align:start position:0%
this
[Music]

01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
um and it currently would be
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
unsustainable especially with uh the
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
number of personnel that we would need
 
01:41:44.239 --> 01:41:45.070 align:start position:0%
number of personnel that we would need
to

01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
hire thank you any further discussion
 
01:41:51.390 --> 01:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
so um just sort of following on that uh
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
this would as as submitted the bill
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
would re would require uh that all the
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
department uh cover all four of the USDA
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
organic Scopes which is well beyond the
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
Department's current means and even if
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
we gave them the money they wouldn't
 
01:42:15.189 --> 01:42:15.199 align:start position:0%
have the Personnel to do it uh even if
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
the bill were amended to Simply require
 
01:42:20.550 --> 01:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
them to do the crop part if the number
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
of people being certified dropped to a
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
very low number the department would not
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
have the option of pulling out they
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
would still have to do it so that's just
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
not really tenable so I'm going to be
 
01:42:34.589 --> 01:42:34.599 align:start position:0%
voting it thank
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%

01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:16.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely outlines some pretty
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
heinous uh
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
actions having to do with animal cruelty
 
01:44:21.599 --> 01:44:22.550 align:start position:0%
actions having to do with animal cruelty
for

01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:30.350 --> 01:44:30.360 align:start position:0%
that but in my discussions with some of
 
01:44:34.189 --> 01:44:34.199 align:start position:0%
um legal people in uh the
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
house the sentiment was that these
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
crimes are so heinous that they already
 
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
fall under um our statute having to do
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
with um animal
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
cruelty and
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty statute is Broad
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
enough that we don't need
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
to uh specifically
 
01:45:05.790 --> 01:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
state every single kind of Cruelty that
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
can be imagine for these
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
animals yes we do have specific
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
statutes um in the animal cruelty stat
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
in the animal cruelty statutes having to
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
do with animals in a motor vehicle
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
docking the tail of a horse as being
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
cruel practices but those practices were
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
identified simply because they may not
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
necessarily be um viewed as cruel
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
leaving a dog in a
 
01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.430 align:start position:0%
leaving a dog in a
car

01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
car
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
or making a horse's tail
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
shorter so the fact that these crimes
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
are so blatantly
 
01:45:56.950 --> 01:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
cruel is already covered under Section
 
01:46:03.149 --> 01:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
644 colon 8 and um so I had I believe
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
that um making this kind of Bill law
 
01:46:13.589 --> 01:46:13.599 align:start position:0%
only opens the door to adding a plethora
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
of specific kinds of Cruelty to statute
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
where we don't need it and that um
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
um we would do so at the probably um
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
there would be some things that we would
 
01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
leave out that people would then you
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
know not consider as being cruel so for
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
all those I I just believe it's an
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary bill um we already have
 
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
these kinds of um out the the things
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
that are outlined in this bill as being
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
federally um uh out banned and outlawed
 
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
and as well as the equin Federation also
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
believes that these um kinds of
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
activities are cruel so uh I I believe
 
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
it's an unnecessary Bill and that's why
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
I am moving to Ita representative Murray
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I also wanted to
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure in the absence of any law
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement that was able to come before
 
01:47:15.390 --> 01:47:15.400 align:start position:0%
the committee um I agree these are
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
heinous reprehensible practices that
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
should not be done to any animal let
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
alone a horse um but I would also like
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
to say it kept me up thinking about the
 
01:47:28.870 --> 01:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
fact that um the first offense would be
 
01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor when in fact I don't know
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a first offense that would
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
be a felony and so the language of the
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
bill says that any First Defense would
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
be considered um a misdemeanor and I I
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
feel that that might actually take away
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
some power um during an investigative
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
process from law enforcement but I
 
01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
didn't hear from anyone to be able to
 
01:47:50.669 --> 01:47:50.679 align:start position:0%
say anything about that thank you
 
01:47:50.679 --> 01:47:52.270 align:start position:0%
say anything about that thank you
representative

01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair uh I I was
 
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
hoping that in the course of discussing
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
this bill we would have somebody from
 
01:47:59.470 --> 01:47:59.480 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office or
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
somebody else who could actually give us
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
some some expert uh guidance in terms of
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
what helps with prosecution what hinders
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
prosecution because my mind could be
 
01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
swayed I'm going to oppose the itl
 
01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
depending on what I might have heard
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
from the attorney general or some other
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
prosecutor I might have been able to to
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
go along with uh support the itl
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
representative ger I don't mean to
 
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
interrupt you I did get in touch with
 
01:48:24.510 --> 01:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
the AG's office they didn't want to
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill uh because they don't
 
01:48:28.750 --> 01:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
give out that kind of advice okay I
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I still it in in my mind
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
I I don't have any reason to believe one
 
01:48:36.510 --> 01:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
way or the other that this is going to
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
be a problem for prosecution so for me
 
01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's an issue but I thank you for
 
01:48:42.830 --> 01:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
that clarification and I I do also want
 
01:48:44.830 --> 01:48:44.840 align:start position:0%
to say that in terms of law enforcement
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues law enforcement um probably
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
aren't right now really looking for
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
these things these specific things and I
 
01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:54.280 align:start position:0%
think that the the virtue of legislation
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
like this is it actually does direct law
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement towards specific acts of
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty so I'll be opposing the
 
01:49:02.910 --> 01:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative Bixby yeah
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
so I was kind of on the fence until I
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk with representative
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
Murray last night about it and uh for
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
those who of you who don't know uh
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murray has spent a lot of
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
time in the eoin world uh so uh she know
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
she knows more than she just mentioned
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that she mentioned
 
01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
in our conversation was that uh the um
 
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
the horse the organizations that run
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
horse shows are generally fairly good
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
about policing their members not
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
Flawless everyone you know not everyone
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
is going to get every single instance of
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
of uh of failure to meet the regular
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
their their requirements but these these
 
01:49:50.149 --> 01:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
practices are uh generally B banned by
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
by all of the horse
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
organizations uh so uh that's one aspect
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
of it the other aspect that really got
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
me thinking that this bill is not only
 
01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
not necessary but is could be
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
counterproductive is the issue of the
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
fact that the first offense is
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
inevitably going to be a misdemeanor
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
when uh under this bill but our C our
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
cruelty statutes say that if someone is
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
purposively harming an
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
animal that is a felony and I don't want
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
someone who's doing these things to be
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
get to get off with a Misti meter when
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
they really should be charged with a
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
felony thank
 
01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
you represent sofikitis
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
I've also heard from faers and they felt
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
that the language was too vague and
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
general um so they were afraid that they
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
would would be caught up in the in the
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
um in the bill that it their their trade
 
01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
would be considered cruel thank
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
you okay I I will direct the um clerk to
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%

01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
our table here is HB
 
01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:38.440 align:start position:0%
1680 which is relative to prohibiting
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
the sale of dogs and cats by retail Pet
 
01:52:44.510 --> 01:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
Shops do I hear a
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
motion representative Penza yes I'd like
 
01:52:50.510 --> 01:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
to make a motion for inexpedient to
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you do I hear a second I
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
second thank you representative kraton
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
representative penzo would you like to
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
yes so we need to support legislation
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
that like accurately defines problems so
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
and whenever this body is like proposing
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
to implement regulating legislation we
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
need to ensure that it actually solves a
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
problem so this bill simply does not do
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
that if there is a sourcing problem in
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that is where the focus of
 
01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:25.880 align:start position:0%
legislation should go for example there
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
is more regulation taking place in the
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
private sector than there is in the
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit sector right now health health
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
certificates should be required for all
 
01:53:38.149 --> 01:53:38.159 align:start position:0%
entities in the state where people are
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
paying for a dog or cat if any of the
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire pet stores are being
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
deceptive in their business practices or
 
01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:48.199 align:start position:0%
selling sick animals there is already a
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
pathway the public should be be
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
utilizing to report to the Department of
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
Justice the C uh which is the consumer
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
protection in antitrust Bureau that is
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why I can't support this Bill
 
01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
the reason why I can't support this Bill
thank

01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
you all right um for me I'd just like to
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
say um I also believe that if we want to
 
01:54:12.750 --> 01:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about where our uh
 
01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
pet stores are sourcing their animals
 
01:54:17.069 --> 01:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
from we can have that conversation but
 
01:54:19.069 --> 01:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
to Simply say we're going to ban pet
 
01:54:22.149 --> 01:54:22.159 align:start position:0%
stores I believe that that is an an
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
anti-business type of sentiment and I
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
can't support that representative cron
 
01:54:30.910 --> 01:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam
 
01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
chair going over my notes and the
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I I agree with everything's
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
been said before this but
 
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh I do not believe from testimony that
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
this will eliminate puppy
 
01:54:47.189 --> 01:54:47.199 align:start position:0%
mills I don't believe that it will
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
achieve the effects that they authors
 
01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
wanted it to achieve and I think the
 
01:54:58.030 --> 01:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
puppy mills uh could sell through other
 
01:54:58.040 --> 01:54:58.910 align:start position:0%
puppy mills uh could sell through other
other

01:54:58.910 --> 01:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
means uh and that this harms the
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
businesses without solving the problem
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the that the Crafters uh intended
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay represent
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
dsy uh yes I will be voting against the
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
itl uh I think this bill is a good first
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
step uh I don't think we have any Silver
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
Bullet as far as um puppy mills are
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
concerned um but again um there uh these
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
bills that have been passed in other
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
states it's been shown that uh the puppy
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
mill business has been decreased in
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
those States I think we've kicked the
 
01:55:42.950 --> 01:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
can down the road uh long enough on this
 
01:55:46.109 --> 01:55:46.119 align:start position:0%
we recognize that we need you know a
 
01:55:50.510 --> 01:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
vast array of regulations to try to cut
 
01:55:55.149 --> 01:55:55.159 align:start position:0%
this uh problem uh down uh I don't know
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
about my colleagues but I received you
 
01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
know I don't know 200 400 I stopped
 
01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
counting uh half in support half in
 
01:56:05.910 --> 01:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
opposed but when I opened up the bills
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
for opposed they came from Washington
 
01:56:13.470 --> 01:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
Oregon Missouri is always the place Iowa
 
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
um those were the bills in support okay
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
so I have to question um you know what
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
what stake do they have in US passing a
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
bill like this so I would encourage my
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues to to re-evaluate their stand
 
01:56:32.950 --> 01:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
on this and consider this a first
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
step represent ger thank you very much
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
Madam chair uh I agree that this isn't
 
01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
going to to solve the entire problem but
 
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
we can't legislate for the entire
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
country we legislate for the State of
 
01:56:45.910 --> 01:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so for that reason I
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
will uh oppose the itl representative
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair for the
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
record I just want to state that back in
 
01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
March of 22 2022 uh to my district
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
article 33 was placed on the ballot and
 
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:00.360 align:start position:0%
I did receive a letter in writing from
 
01:57:02.069 --> 01:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
the town of Amhurst stating the voter's
 
01:57:05.069 --> 01:57:05.079 align:start position:0%
intent for there to be it was roughly
 
01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
2,000 2200 voters in favor of uh
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
stopping puppy mill pipelines to 600 and
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
some odd members 670 maybe in opposition
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and I did want to say that I am
 
01:57:21.069 --> 01:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
because I believe that this bill
 
01:57:23.149 --> 01:57:23.159 align:start position:0%
currently as it stands right now is not
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with the underlying issue of the
 
01:57:27.709 --> 01:57:27.719 align:start position:0%
sourcing of animals and I think that we
 
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
had a very lengthy discussion about
 
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
sourcing animals and um that that
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
impacted a wide variety of of entities
 
01:57:42.069 --> 01:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
that deal with pets um so I just wanted
 
01:57:44.669 --> 01:57:44.679 align:start position:0%
that um acknowledged for the record okay
 
01:57:47.669 --> 01:57:47.679 align:start position:0%
thank you with that I'd like to oh
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yes
 
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
so um my uh my feeling on this bill is
 
01:57:59.149 --> 01:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
that uh it is not it is not going to be
 
01:58:02.310 --> 01:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
effective in doing what it wants to do
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is have an impact on puppy mills
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
the volume of dogs that are sold in New
 
01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a small fraction of what
 
01:58:15.109 --> 01:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
one BR one puppy mill breeder would be
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
producing a small fraction and uh that
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
is and there are and there are lotss of
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
these um problematic breeders out there
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
we don't we do not have enough retail
 
01:58:32.109 --> 01:58:32.119 align:start position:0%
establishments in New Hampshire for this
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
to have an actual impact and given that
 
01:58:40.510 --> 01:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
the existing ones are uh are um given a
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather clause in this bill makes
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
that uh that market impact even smaller
 
01:58:49.069 --> 01:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
I think what we need to do is something
 
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
like what the commissioner was
 
01:58:53.430 --> 01:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
suggesting in terms of looking more
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
broadly at the issue of problematic pet
 
01:58:59.069 --> 01:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
sourcing and looking at all the channels
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
that pets come into the state through
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
and figuring out what sort of more
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive legislation we can come up
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
with in order to address that issue but
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this bill is
 
01:59:13.870 --> 01:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative Bixby I
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
more with that I'd like to uh have the

Davis
 
02:01:06.270 --> 02:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
seconds would you like to speak to your
 
02:01:08.430 --> 02:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
motion representative gerana I would
 
02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair uh I I
 
02:01:13.629 --> 02:01:13.639 align:start position:0%
think that uh there was broad agreement
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill tries to do too much
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
there are kind of several different
 
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
things that aren't uh terribly well
 
02:01:22.189 --> 02:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
related that are connected in in this
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh aspects of it I I think that we
 
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
agreed uh are worthy of further pursuit
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
or further consideration particularly
 
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:33.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to people uh getting
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
accuracy in in labeling but we also
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
agreed that uh there's very very little
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
that we can do in the state of New
 
02:01:41.149 --> 02:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regarding labeling uh and that
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
initiatives in that respect would have
 
02:01:45.629 --> 02:01:45.639 align:start position:0%
to come from from the federal government
 
02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh there was also some very unworkable
 
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the bill reflecting what I
 
02:01:51.629 --> 02:01:51.639 align:start position:0%
think was a lack of understanding about
 
02:01:55.709 --> 02:01:55.719 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology uh that as I said make
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
provision those specific PR provisions
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill on workable and I think we
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
were all a little bit at a loss to
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
understand uh the provision regarding uh
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
ground up insects so uh for all of those
 
02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I urge my committee members
 
02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
to committee colleagues to vote itl
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gerana and I
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
just want to point out that I have
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
drafted a letter um which a copy has
 
02:02:22.350 --> 02:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
been made to all of you with the help of
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
um our committee researcher Kristen
 
02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:29.719 align:start position:0%
Grant um I this letter basically is
 
02:02:32.069 --> 02:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
asking our federal
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
delegation to uh
 
02:02:37.149 --> 02:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
pursue um truth and
 
02:02:40.310 --> 02:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
labeling um legislation at the federal
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
level I'd like you all we don't want to
 
02:02:44.830 --> 02:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to discuss this letter now
 
02:02:49.390 --> 02:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
but I would like in lie of you know of
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
um the motion on this bill I would like
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
you all to take a look at this um
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
proposed letter if you have amendments
 
02:03:00.069 --> 02:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
or changes that you'd like to make to it

love to Madam chair yes um so listening
 
02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
back to the uh work session uh there
 
02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
were some legitimate points brought up
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
by uh DHHS regarding the bill and they
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
had concerns about um some forms of
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
canned foods that I thought were very
 
02:06:13.229 --> 02:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns so uh yeah in the
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know Spirit of compromise I think
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
this is a good Fair Amendment and uh I
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
support the passage of it thank you um
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to point out that I
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
did have a conversation with um Abigail
 
02:06:33.629 --> 02:06:33.639 align:start position:0%
Rogers and Colleen Smith from the HHS
 
02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:35.719 align:start position:0%
food safety which I appreciate their
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
time and efforts in speaking with me
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
which uh was the result the result of
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
which was this amendment which basically
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
removes processed ACI
 
02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
acidified uh foods from the potentially
 
02:06:51.390 --> 02:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
hazardous food
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
definition and I think that uh that
 
02:06:58.149 --> 02:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
would be wonderful for our uh local food
 
02:07:01.149 --> 02:07:01.159 align:start position:0%
producers to be able now to do gold
 
02:07:05.709 --> 02:07:05.719 align:start position:0%
vegetables and um relishes and salses uh
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
as other states do that representative
 
02:07:12.750 --> 02:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah um I am fully in support of
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment I um appreciate the work
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
of Madam chair with our um
 
02:07:21.629 --> 02:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
uh good people from food Protective
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
Services uh I'm I uh I I've done a fair
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
amount of canning uh over the course of
 
02:07:35.549 --> 02:07:35.559 align:start position:0%
the years um mostly uh higher acid uh so
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
tomatoes and pickles and relishes um and
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
I've also canned other things that
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
require pressure canning I would be
 
02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:44.750 align:start position:0%
require pressure canning I would be
perfectly

02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh if I were wanted to sell
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
things selling my high acid can things I
 
02:07:53.549 --> 02:07:53.559 align:start position:0%
would be hesitant to sell anything that
 
02:07:56.669 --> 02:07:56.679 align:start position:0%
required the pressure canning because uh
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of time the the time
 
02:08:00.669 --> 02:08:00.679 align:start position:0%
constraints of doing that in a home
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen are uh and doing it right are
 
02:08:07.709 --> 02:08:07.719 align:start position:0%
really high uh so you know I can buy you
 
02:08:09.589 --> 02:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
know if you go and look at bone broth at
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
the farmers's market it looks expensive
 
02:08:18.669 --> 02:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
and I know why that's so expensive so um
 
02:08:23.109 --> 02:08:23.119 align:start position:0%
so I am fully in support of uh of the
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
acidified foods being available for home
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
production uh I would uh and I'm glad
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that it does not include the low asset
 
02:08:33.669 --> 02:08:33.679 align:start position:0%

02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
products requiring
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
Refrigeration um I would like to make a
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%

bill and I'll speak to my
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
motion so we did talk about
 
02:11:42.790 --> 02:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
um there are some aspects in this
 
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.870 align:start position:0%
um there are some aspects in this
particular

02:11:43.870 --> 02:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
bill um which have some Merit and we
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
would like to explore
 
02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
would like to explore
further

02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
how local food
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
producers May
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
produce Foods as Homestead or Artisan
 
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:03.629 align:start position:0%
produce Foods as Homestead or Artisan
Foods

02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
Foods
 
02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
producers in future because we do know
 
02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
that we do have some constituents that
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
are interested in being able to produce
 
02:12:14.189 --> 02:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
things like pumpkin peses custard pies
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
turkey pot pies chicken pot pies beef
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
casseroles that kind of thing on their
 
02:12:18.920 --> 02:12:19.830 align:start position:0%
casseroles that kind of thing on their
Farm

02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
Farm
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
stands and we'd like to probably sit
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
down with um health food and safety
 
02:12:30.430 --> 02:12:30.440 align:start position:0%
folks and see what we might come up with
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
for some other
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
future um legislation that might include
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
that it might include something where we
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
require people to take food safety
 
02:12:43.709 --> 02:12:43.719 align:start position:0%
courses uh in order to do this or
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
register with Department of Health and
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
Human Services in order to do this but
 
02:12:50.790 --> 02:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
but we should explore some of the ways
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
in which we can um maybe expand food
 
02:12:57.870 --> 02:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
production for locally produced food as
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative suffi is brought up in uh
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
testimony uh for reviewing this bill
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
when covid happened people were were uh
 
02:13:12.229 --> 02:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
not finding food at the grocery stores
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
and to be able to have um more expanded
 
02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
local food opportunities and and have
 
02:13:19.239 --> 02:13:20.149 align:start position:0%
local food opportunities and and have
food

02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
food
 
02:13:23.149 --> 02:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
available um would be something that
 
02:13:26.750 --> 02:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be a preferable thing so I think
 
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
putting this bill in interim study will
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
give us the opportunity to really look
 
02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
at some of the issues and see where we
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
might be able to make some tweaks or
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
changes to current law uh to allow those
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
kinds of activities to happen
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
02:13:47.069 --> 02:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
chair and I I I also want to concur with
 
02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
your thoughts but I also so want to make
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
sure that in supporting the inter room
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
study that we are having the opportunity
 
02:13:54.109 --> 02:13:54.119 align:start position:0%
to bring some of those Artisan
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and small um small
 
02:13:59.669 --> 02:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
producers uh homesteaders whatever we're
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
calling them uh to the table and have
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
this conversation in ways that we have
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
both the department and the you know um
 
02:14:07.870 --> 02:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
Community stakeholders involved in a way
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
that uh we feel it's workable and can
 
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
move forward towards um diversifying our
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
food options absolutely that's the
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
intention representative sofikitis I'd
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
like to V unteer if it passes to be on
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
that committee I'll be looking for
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
volunteers representative Duty yes thank
 
02:14:28.870 --> 02:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
um this bill has eaten away at me for a
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
long time and I've been thinking about
 
02:14:38.109 --> 02:14:38.119 align:start position:0%
it and um the reason is is because from
 
02:14:41.310 --> 02:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
my business background I see this as a
 
02:14:43.910 --> 02:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill to deregulate business and it's
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
masking as a food safety Bill okay so I
 
02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
mean you know we've seen in this
 
02:14:53.069 --> 02:14:53.079 align:start position:0%
legislation no regulations for anybody
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
that does anything that has to do with
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
with home food preparation so my
 
02:15:00.950 --> 02:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
question would be what happens and and I
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
come from a long history of um
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
shopkeepers entrepreneurs who are in the
 
02:15:09.069 --> 02:15:09.079 align:start position:0%
in the food industry my great great
 
02:15:12.510 --> 02:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
grandfather uh made uh sausages my
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
grandfather uh ran a corner store my uh
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
cousin owns a meat market and in all of
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
these cases they supplement their income
 
02:15:25.990 --> 02:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh by by making prepared foods okay so
 
02:15:28.149 --> 02:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
in a bill like this or a future bill
 
02:15:31.030 --> 02:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
that you want to look at what prevents
 
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:33.400 align:start position:0%
Holly Homemaker from setting up shop
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
across the street from a corner store
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay and making prepared sandwiches egg
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
salad H ham salad the whole nine yards
 
02:15:45.790 --> 02:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
okay and selling them at reduced prices
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
because she has no employees she has has
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
no overhead she has no nothing and you
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
know I'm not sure that there's safety
 
02:15:57.069 --> 02:15:57.079 align:start position:0%
things um you know in that it has really
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
taken in
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
consideration um you know people in the
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
cities who are working at low margins I
 
02:16:06.350 --> 02:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
mean their their job Food Service
 
02:16:09.149 --> 02:16:09.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a lot of high margin you
 
02:16:11.149 --> 02:16:11.159 align:start position:0%
know products uh and they could be
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
harmed by this so that would be my
 
02:16:14.390 --> 02:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
question I think that that's a
 
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
consideration something to explore when
 
02:16:19.549 --> 02:16:19.559 align:start position:0%
we do this in St absolutely I mean what
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
is the dynamic that would occur
 
02:16:25.709 --> 02:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
representative Murray um thank you madam
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
chair and and and to the members point I
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
would I would like to say that I think
 
02:16:30.430 --> 02:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
that that's all the more reason that I
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
support the inter room study having
 
02:16:34.589 --> 02:16:34.599 align:start position:0%
worked previously with the Department on
 
02:16:36.990 --> 02:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
mushroom harvesting and foraging and
 
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
finding a pathway to allow folks to
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
safely do that and be able to get their
 
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
product and to retail establishments
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
that is my goal is making sure that we
 
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
see um and there were things that's were
 
02:16:50.669 --> 02:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
stood up for folks to attend classes and
 
02:16:52.230 --> 02:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
participation and I'm not saying that's
 
02:16:54.629 --> 02:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
necessarily 100% the right model but I I
 
02:16:56.349 --> 02:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
fully support the interim study to get
 
02:17:00.349 --> 02:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
to that place okay good representative
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
Duty yes thank you madam chair I just
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
have one last question you know and that
 
02:17:08.309 --> 02:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
is um uh representative attenza said
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
that you know the bills that come
 
02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
forward should be to solve a problem and
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
and I agree I mean every bill that we
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
look at should start with what's the
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
problem what's the issue what are we
 
02:17:21.509 --> 02:17:21.519 align:start position:0%
trying to address and you know I've
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
scratched my head a number of times and
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
I've said this before we throw away 330
 
02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
million tons of food a year none of this
 
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:34.040 align:start position:0%
food is going to go to you know
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
underprivileged or people who you know
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
are food deprived right now so who is
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
this bill meant to serve and what
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I have a little bit of an
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
answer to representative dut's question
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
um there I have several con constituents
 
02:18:01.429 --> 02:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
in my district who have asked me to vote
 
02:18:04.429 --> 02:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
for these bills because because they are
 
02:18:06.349 --> 02:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
limited in what they can offer and and
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
it is a a good part of their income that
 
02:18:12.990 --> 02:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
sustains them them through the year so
 
02:18:16.349 --> 02:18:16.359 align:start position:0%
there there that's who needs it and and
 
02:18:19.509 --> 02:18:19.519 align:start position:0%
we are an hon ENT preneurial State and I
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
think that within the the boundaries of
 
02:18:24.150 --> 02:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
safe delivery of food I think we should
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
we should examine this representative
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
Penza I'd like to piggyback on the
 
02:18:33.389 --> 02:18:33.399 align:start position:0%
statements that representative sfus made
 
02:18:35.309 --> 02:18:35.319 align:start position:0%
when we discussed this during our work
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
session because I think what she said
 
02:18:40.190 --> 02:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
about community and um and what took
 
02:18:43.709 --> 02:18:43.719 align:start position:0%

02:18:49.950 --> 02:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
about people being able to have some
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
extra income I really believe that food
 
02:18:54.990 --> 02:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
and sourcing is really important and I
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%

02:19:56.910 --> 02:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
182 interim study okay uh so the
 
02:19:59.950 --> 02:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
question is is can it go on consent or
 
02:20:02.230 --> 02:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
is it going to be a minority I think it
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
I think it can't go on consent
 
02:20:09.309 --> 02:20:09.319 align:start position:0%
because well no because it's essentially
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
your microphone please if it's if it's
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
20 to Zer or 19 to1 and that one says
 
02:20:17.710 --> 02:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fine consent is fine then
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
then I think that's acceptable but I
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
think that if that that that this
 
02:20:23.230 --> 02:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't quite meet that margin and it's
 
02:20:25.990 --> 02:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
up to the people who voted know whether
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
they want to do a Minority Report would
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
you like a to put it on
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.830 --> 02:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right um we are done with our
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
executing our bills I'm going to call it
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
I want to first thank our uh substitutes
 
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:50.640 align:start position:0%

02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative NAB you have a uh comment
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
um I have a question having been in the
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
minority on the bill
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
um 1182 if it can go on consent we sort
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
of jumped to not putting it on consent
 
02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
but I think the three of us that voted
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the minority are fine with it going
 
02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:09.710 align:start position:0%
in the minority are fine with it going
on

1327 and this is relative to the
 
03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
definition of farmers
 
03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
definition of farmers
markets

03:11:11.510 --> 03:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
markets
 
03:11:13.269 --> 03:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:11:15.790 --> 03:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
I had gotten
 
03:11:19.309 --> 03:11:19.319 align:start position:0%

saying that she had made an error in uh
 
03:11:35.790 --> 03:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
her understanding of um the farmers
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
market and wished for us to itl this
 
03:11:43.870 --> 03:11:43.880 align:start position:0%

the time where the bill could be
 
03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
withdrawn and so in terms of IND
 
03:11:53.110 --> 03:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
introducing we have to int formally
 
03:11:55.870 --> 03:11:55.880 align:start position:0%

03:15:17.150 --> 03:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
introduce um HB
 
03:15:23.110 --> 03:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
1386 which would prohibit the um the
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
disposal of lithium ion batteries in
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
solid waste landfills and
 
03:15:33.790 --> 03:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
incinerators it would also um update the
 
03:15:36.830 --> 03:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
definition of electronic waste which is
 
03:15:39.590 --> 03:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
already banned from disposal in the
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um what you have
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
before you is an amendment it's a
 
03:15:48.630 --> 03:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
replace all amendment that that's why I
 
03:15:50.750 --> 03:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
gave it to you guys I thought um you do
 
03:15:54.469 --> 03:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
have the bill but I there were some
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
changes made based on conversations with
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
some of the stakeholders which I wanted
 
03:16:01.910 --> 03:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
to go through the um through with the
 
03:16:05.070 --> 03:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm going to keep my
 
03:16:07.349 --> 03:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
comments relatively brief because
 
03:16:09.630 --> 03:16:09.640 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of interest and
 
03:16:12.750 --> 03:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
support um for this bill from folks that
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
work with these issues on a day-to-day
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
basis and I want to give them time to
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
make their comments um this bill I'm
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
bringing forward to you as the chair of
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group which is
 
03:16:28.469 --> 03:16:28.479 align:start position:0%
the Statewide um stakeholder group that
 
03:16:30.990 --> 03:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
works with Dees and stakeholders on
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
issues of solid waste um when we
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
discussed uh What
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we would be supporting
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
this year uh I asked the group and two
 
03:16:47.229 --> 03:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
hands went up immediately and then more
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I said okay well what's on your mind
 
03:16:52.630 --> 03:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
and they said lithium batteries and the
 
03:16:55.150 --> 03:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
primary problem with them is that they
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
present a great fire hazard they are
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
also obviously uh valuable materials
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
they really should be
 
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
recycled um and reused to the extent
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
possible and they also are toxic if they
 
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
get into our waist stream so from the
 
03:17:15.469 --> 03:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint of our newly adopted Solid
 
03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
Waste Management plan um the Banning of
 
03:17:22.750 --> 03:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
lithium iron batteries from disposal and
 
03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
the expansion or updating of the
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
electronic waste um the electronic waste
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
definition both support the um the solid
 
03:17:35.469 --> 03:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
waste management plan reducing toxicity
 
03:17:37.750 --> 03:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the waste stream and increasing
 
03:17:40.710 --> 03:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
safety for Public Works
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
employees um as I said I am going to
 
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
keep my comments somewhat to a minimum
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
because the folks that are here to
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
testify on the bill can make a very
 
03:17:53.550 --> 03:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
strong case as to why uh it's a good
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
thing to ban um the disposal of lithium
 
03:18:00.150 --> 03:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
ion batteries um what I wanted to just
 
03:18:02.469 --> 03:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
go through the amendment so it's amend
 
03:18:04.349 --> 03:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm suggesting to the committee for
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:13.389 --> 03:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
04978 um which I passed out to you folks
 
03:18:17.070 --> 03:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
and basically what this amendment does I
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
also gave you the the related statute
 
03:18:23.910 --> 03:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
there in the related statute which you
 
03:18:27.990 --> 03:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a copy of um section Roman numeral
 
03:18:31.790 --> 03:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
2 is what I was proposing to add lithium
 
03:18:36.750 --> 03:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
batteries to section four is the section
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:39.640 align:start position:0%
that Roman numeral 4 is the section that
 
03:18:43.110 --> 03:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
establishes the banon electronic w
 
03:18:46.510 --> 03:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
um and rather than just leaving them as
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
separate Provisions what I did was in my
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment on line six on the first page
 
03:18:56.790 --> 03:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
is I basically combined uh the two
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
Provisions into one so it says no person
 
03:19:02.309 --> 03:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
shall dispose of wet Cell lithium ion or
 
03:19:05.189 --> 03:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
batteries or electronic devices in a
 
03:19:07.790 --> 03:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
landfill or an incinerator and that
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
basically just picks up language that's
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
already in in statute
 
03:19:16.229 --> 03:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
so in subsection B this is the provision
 
03:19:18.189 --> 03:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
in particular that I wanted to talk to
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
the committee about if you look on at
 
03:19:24.510 --> 03:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
the statute which I gave you um for the
 
03:19:27.309 --> 03:19:27.319 align:start position:0%
ban on disposal of ye leaf and yard
 
03:19:29.389 --> 03:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
waste and the ban on disposal of
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
electronic waste there's what we would
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
call a hold harmless Clause that
 
03:19:38.070 --> 03:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
basically says that if the landfill uh
 
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
operator or an incinerator operator
 
03:19:44.670 --> 03:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
provide informational signs to folks
 
03:19:47.070 --> 03:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
telling them of the ban and notifying
 
03:19:49.469 --> 03:19:49.479 align:start position:0%
them that they shouldn't be dumping you
 
03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
can't hold the landfill liable for an
 
03:19:57.830 --> 03:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate disposal in the landfill
 
03:20:02.710 --> 03:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
and so what uh um the solid waste folks
 
03:20:05.710 --> 03:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
asked uh Waste Management in cassella in
 
03:20:08.469 --> 03:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
particular is if the if the hold
 
03:20:10.830 --> 03:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
harmless Clause couldn't also apply to
 
03:20:13.950 --> 03:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
batteries um I've included that in this
 
03:20:16.750 --> 03:20:16.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think that makes a lot of
 
03:20:19.510 --> 03:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
sense I mean you can't hold a landfill
 
03:20:22.590 --> 03:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
operator strictly liable because
 
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
somebody they know not who threw a
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
lithium battery in the thing so I just
 
03:20:30.750 --> 03:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
thought that that was self-evident the
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
other thing that I put in here that I
 
03:20:36.349 --> 03:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
actually am excited about and this is
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
supported by the New Hampshire Municipal
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
Association um it calls for for towns
 
03:20:45.110 --> 03:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste districts and owners or
 
03:20:48.150 --> 03:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
operators of the landfill facilities or
 
03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
incinerators it calls upon them to make
 
03:20:53.630 --> 03:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
educational materials um available on
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
Safe Handling and Recycling and that can
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
be accomplished very simply by just
 
03:21:01.189 --> 03:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
putting a link on their websites it's
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
it's really and um there are plenty of
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
websites out there from the EPA to um
 
03:21:10.030 --> 03:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
some other folks that will be testifying
 
03:21:13.150 --> 03:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
before so that is an easy thing to do
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
and um it also
 
03:21:18.590 --> 03:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
encourages uh these entities to provide
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
recycling opportunities for the
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
batteries when they can I think this
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
just helps everyone because you really I
 
03:21:27.670 --> 03:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
mean from an insurance standpoint from
 
03:21:29.950 --> 03:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
the standpoint of harm to your employees
 
03:21:31.630 --> 03:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
you really want to keep these things out
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
of out of the hopper and and being
 
03:21:38.309 --> 03:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
handled um safely and then the next part
 
03:21:42.429 --> 03:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
of the bill is the same as HB 138 which
 
03:21:46.710 --> 03:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
you had originally um the only thing is
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
that on line 26 inadvertently omitted
 
03:21:52.469 --> 03:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
was video display media recorder player
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
which is a defined term in our statutes
 
03:21:56.670 --> 03:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
and it just wasn't included in the
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
definition of electronic device this
 
03:22:01.830 --> 03:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
section hadn't really been updated since
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
the early
 
03:22:06.110 --> 03:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
2000s and um you know a lot has happened
 
03:22:08.910 --> 03:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
with technology since that time and
 
03:22:11.030 --> 03:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
looking around at other states and
 
03:22:13.910 --> 03:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the definition that we had I
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
just um I updated it it's obviously
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an expansion because it had
 
03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
to expand to include technology that
 
03:22:25.309 --> 03:22:25.319 align:start position:0%
didn't exist 25 years ago and I did make
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
some obvious exclusions from that so
 
03:22:31.349 --> 03:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my testimony I
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
just want to say that uh waste

03:23:29.309 --> 03:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
consumers what is the gauge of the level
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
of awareness of not realizing to put
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
these batteries you know just in their
 
03:23:36.030 --> 03:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
trash because of course you've got the
 
03:23:38.349 --> 03:23:38.359 align:start position:0%
small lithium rechargeable ones right
 
03:23:40.590 --> 03:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
and then you have you know bigger ones
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that would be you know you know hard to
 
03:23:43.630 --> 03:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily put just like in your
 
03:23:43.640 --> 03:23:44.670 align:start position:0%
necessarily put just like in your
regular

03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
regular
 
03:23:48.030 --> 03:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
trash well there's a representative here
 
03:23:52.070 --> 03:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
from uh the national resources Recovery
 
03:23:54.269 --> 03:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
Association she works with uh
 
03:23:56.550 --> 03:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities all across the state so
 
03:23:58.990 --> 03:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
she might be able to answer that uh
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
better than I can um I think there's
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
been a lot of effort at transfer
 
03:24:06.670 --> 03:24:06.680 align:start position:0%
stations and at municipalities to just
 
03:24:09.630 --> 03:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
be like hammering away on the fact that
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be disposing of these
 
03:24:11.359 --> 03:24:12.429 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't be disposing of these
things

03:24:12.429 --> 03:24:12.439 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:24:16.030 --> 03:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
um you know like anything it takes time
 
03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the effects I hope of this
 
03:24:22.269 --> 03:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
bill is it continues to raise the level
 
03:24:24.189 --> 03:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
of awareness especially about these
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries um I mean I was
 
03:24:29.950 --> 03:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
talking to a constituent recently they
 
03:24:32.349 --> 03:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
they ride ebikes and they have these
 
03:24:34.110 --> 03:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries and they have no idea
 
03:24:36.469 --> 03:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
what to do with them and I just said
 
03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on that um and I think
 
03:24:41.670 --> 03:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's in the interest of towns to make it
 
03:24:44.429 --> 03:24:44.439 align:start position:0%
as easy as possible for people to bring
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
these batteries to the transfer stations
 
03:24:49.710 --> 03:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
or tell them what to do with them um in
 
03:24:51.750 --> 03:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
the long run because they should be
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
recycled but they also cause fires and
 
03:24:56.590 --> 03:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
we have somebody here that can talk
 
03:24:58.510 --> 03:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
personally about a fire they had in
 
03:25:01.830 --> 03:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
their town thank you representative eil
 
03:25:05.910 --> 03:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
now I as I understand Dees has on their
 
03:25:10.670 --> 03:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
website um a whole list of different
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
kinds of materials and how to dispose of
 
03:25:16.189 --> 03:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
them right will lithium ion batteries be
 
03:25:19.469 --> 03:25:19.479 align:start position:0%
included in that or are they now I I I
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
mean somebody from the Department is
 
03:25:23.710 --> 03:25:23.720 align:start position:0%
here I believe they have a batteries a
 
03:25:26.830 --> 03:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
whole battery section okay that you can
 
03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
you can use that I know nrra has a
 
03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
batteries tool kit they have all sorts
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
of things on their website and um the
 
03:25:38.269 --> 03:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
EPA also has information so it's just
 
03:25:41.830 --> 03:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know this is part of what what I
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
hope becomes a common practice in towns
 
03:25:48.389 --> 03:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
to have a section of their website that
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
talks about way waste reduction and
 
03:25:53.229 --> 03:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
solid waste and this could easily be a
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
trigger or incorporated into whatever
 
03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
they already have thank you
 
03:25:59.630 --> 03:25:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative marray thank you madam
 
03:26:02.950 --> 03:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you uh representative
 
03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
eel for bringing this forward with
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
regards to line 13 and 14 regarding
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
posting informational signs at the
 
03:26:12.229 --> 03:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
facility um do you imagine that it would
 
03:26:15.309 --> 03:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
also um municipalities might find a
 
03:26:17.269 --> 03:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
resource or a partner in some some
 
03:26:18.910 --> 03:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
entity like New Hampshire the beautiful
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
or some other entity that could help
 
03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
them put that signage up there as well
 
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:26.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I I hope they do I mean in in the
 
03:26:28.229 --> 03:26:28.239 align:start position:0%
case of my town they just have like
 
03:26:33.550 --> 03:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
poster board you know but um I mean the
 
03:26:36.510 --> 03:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
again these things are so hazardous it
 
03:26:38.550 --> 03:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
just anything that the town can sort of
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
get out there at a transfer station or
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
whatever to catch people's attention it
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.990 --> 03:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
good representative H Haskins thank you
 
03:26:51.870 --> 03:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair um and thank you
 
03:26:53.950 --> 03:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question do
 
03:26:56.510 --> 03:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
we know what's happening to them now is
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
that what we're going to hear more about
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
I think you'll be hearing okay more um I
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
I just think we can do a lot better
 
03:27:08.269 --> 03:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
and I guess I would say that I think a
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
lot of transfer stations are really
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
working hard now to make sure that these
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
things stay out of the wa stream but
 
03:27:16.750 --> 03:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
what I heard in at the solid waste
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
working group and in general is that we
 
03:27:20.910 --> 03:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
really need to put a little more teeth
 
03:27:23.950 --> 03:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
into the situation to give them
 
03:27:26.750 --> 03:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
something to point to to to enable them
 
03:27:30.910 --> 03:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
to do be even better than they are thank
 
03:27:33.990 --> 03:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
you any other questions representative
 
03:27:36.670 --> 03:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
Bosman thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:27:38.510 --> 03:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative I know in here it talks a
 
03:27:43.349 --> 03:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
little bit about about increasing the
 
03:27:46.870 --> 03:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
availability of places to deposit all of
 
03:27:49.950 --> 03:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
these items do you have any sense of to
 
03:27:53.309 --> 03:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
what extent we would be able to do that
 
03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
as well I'm thinking education is one
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
side the awareness but if we don't have
 
03:28:00.750 --> 03:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
enough places that are convenient enough
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
then it won't happen so how do you see
 
03:28:05.710 --> 03:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
this bill speaking to that um again
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
someone is here from nrra and she can
 
03:28:10.510 --> 03:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit more about systems
 
03:28:13.710 --> 03:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
that are already in place but um because
 
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
I anticipated this question I looked at
 
03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
a um a website from a company called
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
call to recycle which um I know towns
 
03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
are already using and there's actually
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
information on there you can put in your
 
03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
location and they can tell you the
 
03:28:33.710 --> 03:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
nearest place that you can bring um
 
03:28:37.510 --> 03:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
bring your batteries and what I saw was
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
Home Depot I I know and then with
 
03:28:43.630 --> 03:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
electronic way waste um you can bring it
 
03:28:44.990 --> 03:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
I mean this is what I've done I just
 
03:28:47.070 --> 03:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
bring it to Best Buy and they take it
 
03:28:49.189 --> 03:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
and then they re for free and then they
 
03:28:49.199 --> 03:28:50.309 align:start position:0%
and then they re for free and then they
recycle

03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
recycle
 
03:28:54.030 --> 03:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
it this is not a paid um advertisement
 
03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah um I'm just
 
03:28:58.910 --> 03:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
wondering what sort of enfor enforcement
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
Provisions there are if
 
03:29:05.150 --> 03:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
any um well I asked the department that
 
03:29:09.070 --> 03:29:09.080 align:start position:0%
this morning and um it's the enforcement
 
03:29:12.349 --> 03:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
provision that uh appli appes to any
 
03:29:17.469 --> 03:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
provision that's in 149 M um and that is
 
03:29:21.630 --> 03:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
149 M5 and 16 and so even though that
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
provision isn't specifically called out
 
03:29:27.870 --> 03:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
in many of the statutes or Provisions
 
03:29:31.510 --> 03:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
under 149 M that is the standard
 
03:29:34.030 --> 03:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement language that the department
 
03:29:37.110 --> 03:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
uses for administrative uh enforcement
 
03:29:39.550 --> 03:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
and if they need to turn it to the AG
 
03:29:42.269 --> 03:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
for criminal sanctions
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
um since I we don't have that right in
 
03:29:45.910 --> 03:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
front of us can you give us a brief
 
03:29:47.510 --> 03:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
summary of what that looks like what I
 
03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
would do is defer to the department to
 
03:29:53.590 --> 03:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
give that to you I mean I actually I I
 
03:29:58.189 --> 03:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
noticed that in 149
 
03:30:01.510 --> 03:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
m273 which I gave you the copy of the
 
03:30:03.710 --> 03:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
statute does specifically say it's
 
03:30:08.349 --> 03:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
enforcable under 149 M5 and 16 and so
 
03:30:10.150 --> 03:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I asked the
 
03:30:12.830 --> 03:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
department the question is I said well
 
03:30:15.750 --> 03:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
just because if you don't specifically
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
mention it isn't that the provision that
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
you use to enforce these things and they
 
03:30:22.910 --> 03:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
said yes so maybe when they wrote The
 
03:30:24.710 --> 03:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
Leaf and yard waste provision they
 
03:30:26.269 --> 03:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a little belt and
 
03:30:28.950 --> 03:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
suspenders operation but it's really not
 
03:30:32.710 --> 03:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
necessary to be in there thank you okay
 
03:30:35.309 --> 03:30:35.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
03:30:38.189 --> 03:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
evil seeing none thank you so much for
 
03:30:40.870 --> 03:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
bringing this to our committee sure
 
03:30:43.389 --> 03:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
thank thank you and I would like now to
 
03:30:43.399 --> 03:30:45.510 align:start position:0%

you're live thank you madam chair um my
 
03:31:07.150 --> 03:31:07.160 align:start position:0%
name is Garrett triler I'm director of
 
03:31:09.750 --> 03:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
public affairs for Waste Management uh
 
03:31:10.990 --> 03:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
waste management is the leading provider
 
03:31:12.990 --> 03:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
provider of Environmental Services in uh
 
03:31:15.950 --> 03:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
North America um in New Hampshire we
 
03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
operate the turnkey recycling
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
environmental Enterprise in Rochester we
 
03:31:24.349 --> 03:31:24.359 align:start position:0%
have four transfer stations a recycling
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
facility and 200 uh waste and recycling
 
03:31:27.910 --> 03:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
collection trucks that operate
 
03:31:30.030 --> 03:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so issues like this
 
03:31:32.189 --> 03:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
we certainly um get very involved when
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
there's issues that will impact the
 
03:31:35.950 --> 03:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
industry I'm very happy to be here in
 
03:31:39.309 --> 03:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
support today of uh House Bill
 
03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
1386 um as has been discussed uh lithium
 
03:31:45.349 --> 03:31:45.359 align:start position:0%
ion batteries are a form of rechargeable
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
batteries that can be bought
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
individually or also contained in quite
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
a few uh electronic devices uh all the
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
way up to as well as up to cars um um
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
when disposed of improperly these
 
03:31:58.790 --> 03:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
batteries can be very problematic for
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
waste transfer stations and recycling
 
03:32:04.269 --> 03:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
facilities um mostly uh in fact EPA
 
03:32:06.429 --> 03:32:06.439 align:start position:0%
determined that most uh lithium ion
 
03:32:08.710 --> 03:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
batteries on the market are likely to be
 
03:32:10.510 --> 03:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
hazardous wastes when they are disposed
 
03:32:13.389 --> 03:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
of because they can catch fire explode
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
if not handled
 
03:32:17.429 --> 03:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
carefully and to that point uh several
 
03:32:19.070 --> 03:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
of our facilities in New Hampshire have
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
faced impacts from in improper uh
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
handling of these batteries uh in 2023
 
03:32:27.510 --> 03:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
we experienced Fires at our recycle
 
03:32:29.870 --> 03:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester recycling facility one that
 
03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
almost destroyed the entire building and
 
03:32:33.950 --> 03:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
we had two fires at our Auburn transfer
 
03:32:36.510 --> 03:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
station La that year as well several
 
03:32:39.469 --> 03:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
years ago a fire at our Laconia transfer
 
03:32:42.910 --> 03:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
station um completely uh destroy the
 
03:32:44.910 --> 03:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
building uh requiring it to be out of
 
03:32:46.670 --> 03:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
service for quite a while and cost
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
upwards of $100,000 to repair um this is
 
03:32:53.229 --> 03:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
only a literally a few examples I I
 
03:32:55.269 --> 03:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
cover the New England and New York area
 
03:32:57.189 --> 03:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
and we were having issues all throughout
 
03:32:58.990 --> 03:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
not just our region but all throughout
 
03:33:01.269 --> 03:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
the country our industry trade
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
Association the national waste and
 
03:33:05.429 --> 03:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
recycling Association recently released
 
03:33:07.630 --> 03:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
a port a report I'm sorry that estimates
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
that more than 5,000 fires annually just
 
03:33:12.309 --> 03:33:12.319 align:start position:0%
in recycling facilities alone they
 
03:33:14.070 --> 03:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
didn't even study transfer stations
 
03:33:17.670 --> 03:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
which is also a major problem um n did
 
03:33:20.189 --> 03:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh submit testimony uh via your online
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
system so you should have their
 
03:33:22.910 --> 03:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
testimony as well as a copy of that
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
report um which has a lot of other
 
03:33:26.950 --> 03:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
really detailed information about the
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
costs not just to the facilities not
 
03:33:31.349 --> 03:33:31.359 align:start position:0%
just to the facility operators but in
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
fire departments and and the like and
 
03:33:36.030 --> 03:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
certainly in Insurance um and I would
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
also note that it's anticipated that the
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
use of these types of batteries is only
 
03:33:41.469 --> 03:33:41.479 align:start position:0%
going to increase very very greatly over
 
03:33:44.229 --> 03:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
the next 5 10 years so unless things
 
03:33:46.590 --> 03:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
like these bills are passed um these
 
03:33:49.189 --> 03:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
issues are going to continue um I would
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
also just like to to quickly mention um
 
03:33:54.229 --> 03:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
we did get a copy of the amendment and I
 
03:33:56.269 --> 03:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
do think a real critical component of
 
03:33:58.790 --> 03:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is the educational aspect um the
 
03:34:00.990 --> 03:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
ban is great I think it helps have that
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
conversation with folks um but also um
 
03:34:07.110 --> 03:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
knowing where these batteries exist uh
 
03:34:08.630 --> 03:34:08.640 align:start position:0%
are also very important I would liken it
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit to the effort that was
 
03:34:12.429 --> 03:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
undertaken over the number of years on
 
03:34:14.750 --> 03:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
Mercury containing products um
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
especially in areas where waste of
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
energy is prevalent um so I think it can
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
be done it's just going to take some
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
time and I think we all should work
 
03:34:22.469 --> 03:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
together so happy to support the
 
03:34:24.110 --> 03:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislation I can take any questions
 
03:34:25.349 --> 03:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from the
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative Kwa thank you
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for being here
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
and taking my question of
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
course right now there is no legislation
 
03:34:38.950 --> 03:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
Banning lithium batteries but as you
 
03:34:41.189 --> 03:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
privately own landfills
 
03:34:44.630 --> 03:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
can't you ban them yourselves well we
 
03:34:46.469 --> 03:34:46.479 align:start position:0%
can we do work with our customers so we
 
03:34:48.630 --> 03:34:48.640 align:start position:0%
do try to educate our customers to that
 
03:34:51.269 --> 03:34:51.279 align:start position:0%
point um I think having a ban helps that
 
03:34:53.269 --> 03:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
messaging a bit because then there's you
 
03:34:55.710 --> 03:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
know some potential like we said maybe
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
some enforcement action on that so
 
03:34:58.670 --> 03:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing preventing us from
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
educating our customers which we will
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
continue to do um we also are only a one
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
player here so I think you know all
 
03:35:07.870 --> 03:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
companies I think we are doing that I
 
03:35:08.990 --> 03:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
mean we absolutely if you go on our
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
website we do have plenty of information
 
03:35:12.790 --> 03:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
about how to recycle properly not just
 
03:35:14.429 --> 03:35:14.439 align:start position:0%
on lithium ion batteries but a whole
 
03:35:16.710 --> 03:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
host of issues so the answer is we can
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
do that and we will continue to do that
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
I do think having this law would would
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
help that thank you any other questions
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
03:35:29.950 --> 03:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
so much for coming today appreciate it
 
03:35:31.950 --> 03:35:31.960 align:start position:0%
i' like to call Reagan

it so and before you start I'm just
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to uh let the committee know I

will be leaving shortly uh because I
 
03:36:04.189 --> 03:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
have to introduce a bill of mine in
 
03:36:05.950 --> 03:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
another committee and I will leave you
 
03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the very capable hands of
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%

programs um organization doesn't take a
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
position on this bill simply because we
 
03:36:35.990 --> 03:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't engage in lobbying but I am here
 
03:36:37.830 --> 03:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
to just share some information about our

03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
recycling one thing I'd like to mention
 
03:36:51.070 --> 03:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
is that the uh this bill is consistent
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
with one of the action items in the New
 
03:36:55.070 --> 03:36:55.080 align:start position:0%

Management plan in October of
 
03:37:05.870 --> 03:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
2022 and that plan identifies ways to uh
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
reduce waste being disposed of in the
 
03:37:11.030 --> 03:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
state and also improve waste production
 
03:37:13.590 --> 03:37:13.600 align:start position:0%

03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh reasons why lithium ion
 
03:37:33.790 --> 03:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
batteries are dangerous and costly for
 
03:37:36.030 --> 03:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
facilities we as an organization are
 
03:37:38.110 --> 03:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
certainly hearing more and more from our
 
03:37:40.110 --> 03:37:40.120 align:start position:0%
member communities about fires that
 
03:37:42.790 --> 03:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
there experiencing at their transfer
 
03:37:45.429 --> 03:37:45.439 align:start position:0%
stations and I'd like to provide just a
 
03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
few examples that have come up in recent
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
years so in June of 2020 the city of
 
03:37:55.229 --> 03:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
keen transfer station had a fire they
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
suspected it was caused by something
 
03:37:59.469 --> 03:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
improperly disposed of certainly could
 
03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
have been a lithium ion battery um but
 
03:38:03.309 --> 03:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
in many cases it's difficult to
 
03:38:04.870 --> 03:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
ultimately determine what causes these
 
03:38:07.950 --> 03:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
fires but in that case a firefighter
 
03:38:10.550 --> 03:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
experienced a back injury from that fire
 
03:38:12.429 --> 03:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
there was considerable damage to their
 
03:38:14.950 --> 03:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
transfer station that had to be
 
03:38:19.710 --> 03:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
repaired um nearby in Portland Maine in
 
03:38:22.189 --> 03:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh January 2021 the recycling nonprofit
 
03:38:24.590 --> 03:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
Ecom main had a lithium ion battery fire
 
03:38:26.510 --> 03:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
at their facility fortunately they were
 
03:38:29.469 --> 03:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
able to resume operations the next day I
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
think you'll be hearing from the town of
 
03:38:33.910 --> 03:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
Lee and a lithium ion battery that they
 
03:38:36.870 --> 03:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
had uh in May of
 
03:38:41.309 --> 03:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
2022 in May of 2023 Bart New Hampshire
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
had a fire at their transfer station
 
03:38:45.309 --> 03:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
caused by an electric bike
 
03:38:47.670 --> 03:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
battery and they were able to quickly
 
03:38:49.710 --> 03:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
contain that fire with no
 
03:38:52.229 --> 03:38:52.239 align:start position:0%
injuries and then one more example in
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
August of 2023 over in our neighboring
 
03:38:57.550 --> 03:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
Vermont Alva was service had a fire at
 
03:38:59.710 --> 03:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
their transfer station that they thought
 
03:39:02.030 --> 03:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
was most likely from a lithium ion
 
03:39:04.630 --> 03:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
battery um and one thing I wanted to
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
point out is that these batteries don't
 
03:39:08.790 --> 03:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
typically just sort of spontaneously
 
03:39:10.830 --> 03:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
combust on their own the real issue is
 
03:39:13.510 --> 03:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
when they're not properly recycled and
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
they end up uh in the trash and you've
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
got heavy equipment that is moving trash
 
03:39:22.110 --> 03:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
or driving over material and it's when
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
those batteries get punctured that then
 
03:39:27.550 --> 03:39:27.560 align:start position:0%
they can cause a fire um so some of the
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions that came up from the
 
03:39:32.510 --> 03:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee um one was how aware people
 
03:39:36.110 --> 03:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
are of this issue I would say that
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're certainly not aware enough I
 
03:39:39.070 --> 03:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
mean we're seeing more and more of these
 
03:39:42.110 --> 03:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
fires um we're certainly seeing more and
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
more recharging lithium ion batteries
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
being used in uh electronics and other
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
devices and so it's really important
 
03:39:52.510 --> 03:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
that we do whatever can be done to um
 
03:39:55.429 --> 03:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
increase public awareness and on that
 
03:39:58.990 --> 03:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
note uh I did want to share that one of
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
the things that is currently happening
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
with batteries and other electronics
 
03:40:05.630 --> 03:40:05.640 align:start position:0%
right now is that there are a number of
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
options for communities to properly
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
recycle those materials so the nor East
 
03:40:13.510 --> 03:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
resource recovery Association works with
 
03:40:15.469 --> 03:40:15.479 align:start position:0%
um a variety of different recycling
 
03:40:17.030 --> 03:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
companies in New Hampshire and New
 
03:40:19.309 --> 03:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
England and that includes working with a
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
number of electronics recycling
 
03:40:24.790 --> 03:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
companies that also can accept uh
 
03:40:24.800 --> 03:40:26.030 align:start position:0%
companies that also can accept uh
batteries

03:40:26.030 --> 03:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
batteries
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
from uh communities in New Hampshire so
 
03:40:30.870 --> 03:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
there are options and outlets for
 
03:40:33.030 --> 03:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
properly managing that
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
material uh typically that's handled at
 
03:40:38.790 --> 03:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
the municipal level where residents can
 
03:40:40.670 --> 03:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
often bring their batteries or their
 
03:40:42.790 --> 03:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
Electronics to their local transfer
 
03:40:45.710 --> 03:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
station and then the transfer station
 
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
can properly um send that material to
 
03:40:48.399 --> 03:40:49.429 align:start position:0%
can properly um send that material to
get

03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
recycled our organization also provides
 
03:40:54.349 --> 03:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of educational material geared
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
towards both uh Municipal transfer
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
station staff and residents we have a
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
batteries recycling toolkit on our
 
03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
website and one of the things it
 
03:41:07.229 --> 03:41:07.239 align:start position:0%
includes is a poster that communities
 
03:41:09.710 --> 03:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
can download and print for free that
 
03:41:12.309 --> 03:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
explain explains how to properly uh
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
manage and recycle different types of
 
03:41:17.030 --> 03:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
batteries and that's been pretty popular
 
03:41:20.750 --> 03:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly if this law gets passed
 
03:41:23.149 --> 03:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
our organization would be very happy to
 
03:41:24.269 --> 03:41:24.279 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of
 
03:41:26.469 --> 03:41:26.479 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to help provide
 
03:41:28.510 --> 03:41:28.520 align:start position:0%
any supportive uh developing any
 
03:41:30.830 --> 03:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
additional signage or other materials
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
that might be useful to post- at
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
transfer stations or share with
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
residents um for example we're actually
 
03:41:39.309 --> 03:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
working right now with a nonprofit
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
called New Hampshire the the beautiful
 
03:41:44.189 --> 03:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
and they provide free uh facility
 
03:41:46.710 --> 03:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
recycling signage for transfer stations
 
03:41:48.429 --> 03:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and we're actually
 
03:41:50.750 --> 03:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
working with them right now on reviewing
 
03:41:52.510 --> 03:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
and modernizing a lot of the signage
 
03:41:54.550 --> 03:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
that they offer for municipalities so
 
03:41:57.389 --> 03:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
certainly um uh updated signage
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
regarding waste bands including a ban on
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries is something that
 
03:42:05.309 --> 03:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
we would be happy to assist
 
03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
with so if anyone has any questions I'd
 
03:42:10.750 --> 03:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them representa right
 
03:42:13.229 --> 03:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so thank you for
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question so can in talking
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
about the varying size of lithium
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
batteries and lithium ion batteries they
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
can go from being as small as something
 
03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
like a coin or a button battery all the
 
03:42:28.550 --> 03:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
way to car um so in which case I do you
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
see there being a lot of consumer and
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
education that needs to happen to say
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
that yes these these small button coin
 
03:42:40.269 --> 03:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
things also go into this sort of
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
conversation or I mean ideally yes
 
03:42:47.510 --> 03:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
ideally we'd have a nationwide consumer
 
03:42:49.910 --> 03:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
education campaign around this because
 
03:42:52.309 --> 03:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the dangers of these rechargeable
 
03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
batteries and and as you said they can
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
vary from very very small I mean often
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
even if consumer wants to properly
 
03:43:02.429 --> 03:43:02.439 align:start position:0%
manage these it can be difficult for
 
03:43:05.910 --> 03:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
example uh if you've got um shoes little
 
03:43:08.510 --> 03:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
kids shoes that have lights in them or
 
03:43:11.349 --> 03:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
toys sometimes you can't even get them
 
03:43:12.670 --> 03:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's no way to open them to get to
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
the rechargeable battery inside so it
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
can be increasingly difficult for
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
residents it's confusing so um the more
 
03:43:24.830 --> 03:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
issue just ma'am I have a I do have a
 
03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
question in terms of scope and so you
 
03:43:35.070 --> 03:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
talked about the transfer stations
 
03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
having this capability to recycle
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
what's your assessment on does 100% of
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
transportations have that 50% or where
 
03:43:51.389 --> 03:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
are we at with that even at the Town
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
level I don't have an exact number on
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
that but what I would say is I know it's
 
03:43:58.189 --> 03:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
not 100% of Municipal transfer stations
 
03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
that accept electronics and batteries
 
03:44:02.349 --> 03:44:02.359 align:start position:0%
but I would say it's certainly more than
 
03:44:06.149 --> 03:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
50% it's very common that towns offer
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
that as a service to their
 
03:44:08.800 --> 03:44:11.189 align:start position:0%
that as a service to their
residents

03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:44:12.990 --> 03:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
and how many
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities do you have in the
 
03:44:19.030 --> 03:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
state so how easy is it for the transfer
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
station then to move that on to an
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate recycling point so at least
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
for the the transfer stations that are
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
working with our organization one of the
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
things we do is we make it as easy as
 
03:44:32.710 --> 03:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
possible to manage those Logistics of
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
getting material to the ultimate
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
recycling company uh I can think of
 
03:44:39.990 --> 03:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
three or four different different
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
companies that we work with that are
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
based in New Hampshire that do battery
 
03:44:46.910 --> 03:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
electronics recycling um one specific
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
example is universal recycling
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
Technologies has a large facility in
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
Dober where they actually um manage a
 
03:44:57.469 --> 03:44:57.479 align:start position:0%
lot of electronics and and do some
 
03:44:59.309 --> 03:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
recycling right there at the facility so
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
we do have options within the state okay
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative BX so uh our
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries one of the items that
 
03:45:09.199 --> 03:45:10.429 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries one of the items that
uh

03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
that a re a transfer station can sell at
 
03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
a profit or to the company that's taking
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
them or is this one that that costs to
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
get rid of it's It's currently typically
 
03:45:26.910 --> 03:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
at a cost so one of the challenges for
 
03:45:30.710 --> 03:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
communities is say if a municipality had
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
a very large quantity of lithium ion
 
03:45:35.389 --> 03:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
batteries maybe if they had enough of
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
that material there could be an outlet
 
03:45:39.349 --> 03:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
where they actually could get paid a bit
 
03:45:41.469 --> 03:45:41.479 align:start position:0%
of money for that but when you take into
 
03:45:44.870 --> 03:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
account relatively small amounts um the
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
necessity to be trucking this material
 
03:45:49.070 --> 03:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere and the hall fees associated
 
03:45:50.469 --> 03:45:50.479 align:start position:0%
with that communities are typically
 
03:45:52.990 --> 03:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
having to pay to dispose of those
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
materials properly and so in some cases
 
03:45:58.269 --> 03:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
they might uh charge a fee to Residents
 
03:46:00.229 --> 03:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
um and I believe also um someone from
 
03:46:01.710 --> 03:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
the town of Lee can speak a little bit
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
more to that situation follow up please
 
03:46:09.149 --> 03:46:09.159 align:start position:0%
uh so is the amount that is the is that
 
03:46:10.189 --> 03:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
fee amount
 
03:46:12.990 --> 03:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
I there are some things that will cost
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
um a certain amount to dispose of but
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
that amount would be lower than the
 
03:46:20.149 --> 03:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
amount of a tipping fee is that do or is
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
this would lithium ion batteries fall
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
into the this is cheaper than a tipping
 
03:46:26.070 --> 03:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
fee or this is more expensive than a
 
03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
tipping fee or are they just so light
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't it's sort of hard to
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
calculate they're typically so small
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
that it is sort of negligible um unless
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with the the car
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
batteries okay thanks and represent Mar
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair what to that end
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
for the larger batteries there are
 
03:46:48.429 --> 03:46:48.439 align:start position:0%
dealerships that often times will do
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
recovery of those types of very large
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
batteries um themselves um do you see
 
03:46:59.269 --> 03:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
this um do you see the opportunity for
 
03:47:01.590 --> 03:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
more of those types of recapture
 
03:47:03.870 --> 03:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities happening even outside of
 
03:47:06.590 --> 03:47:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:09.070 --> 03:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
stations well certainly I think transfer
 
03:47:11.469 --> 03:47:11.479 align:start position:0%
stations would be happy if the batteries
 
03:47:13.469 --> 03:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
were going somewhere else so if if a car
 
03:47:16.750 --> 03:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
dealership will take back um electric
 
03:47:18.670 --> 03:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
batteries from cars that's certainly
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
preferable um there's currently not as
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
many outlets for recycling that material
 
03:47:25.309 --> 03:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
um so they're a bit more difficult for
 
03:47:27.070 --> 03:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
transfer stations to
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
manage I would say in terms of you know
 
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
you're getting into sort of extended
 
03:47:34.189 --> 03:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility uh if there was
 
03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
some requirement to make the producers
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of these materials
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
actually Ensure that they can be uh
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
responsibly recycled in a you know
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
financially viable way that's certainly
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
one option to deal with the
 
03:47:50.389 --> 03:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
problem any further
 
03:47:52.229 --> 03:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much for your
 
03:47:56.070 --> 03:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you I'd like to call Mr
 
03:47:59.670 --> 03:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
Steve I believe this is
 
03:48:04.790 --> 03:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:10.349 --> 03:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
I what go ahead my last name's bulock
 
03:48:13.110 --> 03:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
can you spell please b u l l e k okay
 
03:48:13.120 --> 03:48:15.750 align:start position:0%
can you spell please b u l l e k okay
thank

03:48:15.750 --> 03:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:18.510 --> 03:48:18.520 align:start position:0%
you yes sir so I'm from the town of Lee
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
I'm the Public Works director we had a
 
03:48:25.710 --> 03:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
fire in our facility in May of a couple
 
03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
years ago we are in support of this
 
03:48:32.149 --> 03:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill uh I'd
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
say if a 100 batteries come into the
 
03:48:37.830 --> 03:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
facility we might recycle 50 of them we
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
pull them out of the waist stream all
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
the time time and then bring them up
 
03:48:46.910 --> 03:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's we've had numerous close
 
03:48:48.990 --> 03:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
calls but yeah I'm in support of the
 
03:48:52.229 --> 03:48:52.239 align:start position:0%
bill it mainly came in case you had
 
03:48:55.389 --> 03:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
questions there
 
03:48:57.149 --> 03:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
potential the batteries that you're
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
pulling out are they um are they
 
03:49:03.189 --> 03:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
small some are some a lot of them are
 
03:49:05.030 --> 03:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
power tool batteries like Milwaukee
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
batteries old DeWalt
 
03:49:09.030 --> 03:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
batteries oh like the ones that attach
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
to that's 90% of what we do the fire at
 
03:49:14.990 --> 03:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
our facility was actually started by a
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
laptop computer battery someone got a
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
new battery threw the old one out and it
 
03:49:23.710 --> 03:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
still had a charge in it and the Machine
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
pinched it and it arked out on the
 
03:49:29.309 --> 03:49:29.319 align:start position:0%
bucket and caused a
 
03:49:32.670 --> 03:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
fire I'd say from when it started
 
03:49:34.149 --> 03:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
smoking to when the bucket was
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
completely engulfed in flames was 30
 
03:49:40.750 --> 03:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
seconds so it happens fast
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
follow up yes ma'am would you say the
 
03:49:45.750 --> 03:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
greatest problem that we have is is
 
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
education in the public for not
 
03:49:51.870 --> 03:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
realizing to the yeah I mean so they go
 
03:49:53.429 --> 03:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
all the way down to greeting cards you
 
03:49:55.030 --> 03:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
have a greeting card you open up and it
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
plays music or lights up that's a
 
03:49:58.229 --> 03:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
lithium battery that's oh my gosh I
 
03:49:59.710 --> 03:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
forgot about
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
those oh my
 
03:50:03.790 --> 03:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
gosh okay any other questions
 
03:50:06.910 --> 03:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you uh Mr
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
Sharon thank you for taking my question
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you being here today
 
03:50:10.990 --> 03:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
because I think this is an important
 
03:50:12.429 --> 03:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
conversation that we are having I think
 
03:50:16.110 --> 03:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned those um
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
items that have stuff in beded in them
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
that are coins or or button batteries
 
03:50:24.590 --> 03:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes um what do you see um as far as
 
03:50:25.910 --> 03:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
getting those types of things out of the
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
waist room how is that possible or do
 
03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
you just education and pictures okay
 
03:50:31.550 --> 03:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
because a lot of people don't think of
 
03:50:34.950 --> 03:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:38.149 --> 03:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
you all right uh represent Penza one
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
more sorry for you the
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
world so
 
03:50:46.110 --> 03:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
um so you said just of course getting
 
03:50:47.870 --> 03:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
them out would be there's an education
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
piece but what would people that's
 
03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
something that is not like a traditional
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
like the greeting card right that's not
 
03:50:55.630 --> 03:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
a traditional
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
um uh recyclable P like what would
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
people do with them
 
03:51:05.710 --> 03:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
then so what we would do if we find them
 
03:51:07.790 --> 03:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
in the mixed paper bin is we take him
 
03:51:10.630 --> 03:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
out take the B battery out and then
 
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
recycle it like we would all the other
 
03:51:14.790 --> 03:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
stuff so you just have to take it apart
 
03:51:14.800 --> 03:51:17.189 align:start position:0%
stuff so you just have to take it apart
okay

03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
perfect all right thank you sir really
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
03:51:32.469 --> 03:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon members of the
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Brian Allard I'm
 
03:51:36.950 --> 03:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
the assistant director with the New
 
03:51:38.750 --> 03:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Fire Marshalls Office
 
03:51:40.469 --> 03:51:40.479 align:start position:0%
I'm Marsh to me apologizes he couldn't
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
be here today he did submit a written
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
testimony ahead of time and I'll just
 
03:51:47.149 --> 03:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
read through that uh for you uh so
 
03:51:49.510 --> 03:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
lithium ion fires uh are certainly a
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
growing concern across our country uh
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
the use of lithium ion batteries
 
03:51:56.149 --> 03:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
increases year-over-year
 
03:51:58.710 --> 03:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
a particular concern is the speed and
 
03:52:02.030 --> 03:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
fire growth um and the excessive amount
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
of heat that is released from those
 
03:52:06.070 --> 03:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
fires and in the intensity of those
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
fires uh lithium ion batteries can
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
experienced thermal runaway uh which can
 
03:52:13.830 --> 03:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
result in overheating flaming and some
 
03:52:16.349 --> 03:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
cases explosion of the batteries uh
 
03:52:18.510 --> 03:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
significant work is underway to study uh
 
03:52:21.750 --> 03:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
these types of issues um back in
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
November of 2023 there's a national
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
campaign uh charge of battery safe
 
03:52:30.510 --> 03:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
campaign so that the charge stands for
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
choose certified
 
03:52:35.189 --> 03:52:35.199 align:start position:0%
products handle lithium ion battery
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
powered devices with care always stay
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
alert and uh of warning signs recycle
 
03:52:43.229 --> 03:52:43.239 align:start position:0%
devices and batteries properly uh get
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
out if there is a fire and finally
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
educate others on the best practice
 
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
which is the message that we're hearing
 
03:52:51.149 --> 03:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
today from the others who have testified
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh so we certainly support this bill and
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
the proper recycling of of these
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
batteries and I'm here for any questions
 
03:53:01.990 --> 03:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you have any any
 
03:53:04.309 --> 03:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
03:53:06.750 --> 03:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
03:53:13.870 --> 03:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:31.309 --> 03:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
you please turn on your
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you awesome uh thank
 
03:53:39.030 --> 03:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
you for uh allowing the opportunity to
 
03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
testify on uh HB 1386 for the record my
 
03:53:44.550 --> 03:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
name is Michael norc uh I am
 
03:53:45.830 --> 03:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
03:53:47.550 --> 03:53:47.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services uh
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management
 
03:53:53.149 --> 03:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau um this bill as I can't really
 
03:53:54.510 --> 03:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
add much to the comments that were
 
03:53:56.429 --> 03:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
already provided by other folks uh that
 
03:54:00.309 --> 03:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
testified previously uh other than to
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
say you know this is an important issue
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh Recycling and and proper management
 
03:54:09.110 --> 03:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
of uh lithium ion batteries uh and as as
 
03:54:11.389 --> 03:54:11.399 align:start position:0%
well as proper management of electronic
 
03:54:14.590 --> 03:54:14.600 align:start position:0%
devices um to the extent that you know
 
03:54:17.149 --> 03:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
proper management of these items reduces
 
03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
toxicity of the waste stream uh and
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
increases safety at Solid Waste
 
03:54:24.469 --> 03:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
Management facilities and also supports
 
03:54:25.750 --> 03:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:54:28.710 --> 03:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um the solid
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
waste management plan that we have
 
03:54:32.790 --> 03:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
developed uh as was noted by Miss Bess
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
Binet from
 
03:54:34.479 --> 03:54:36.670 align:start position:0%
Binet from
nrra

03:54:36.670 --> 03:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
nrra
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
um with that being said we do support
 
03:54:41.429 --> 03:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill we cannot take a
 
03:54:45.110 --> 03:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
position on this specific bill um but we
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
do recognize that proper management of
 
03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
these batteries is of particular
 
03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
importance for safety and for all the
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
reasons that were noted previously
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to address a couple
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions that I I noticed the uh the
 
03:55:00.590 --> 03:55:00.600 align:start position:0%
committee already brought up I believe
 
03:55:02.469 --> 03:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
is representative Bixby had asked about
 
03:55:02.479 --> 03:55:03.830 align:start position:0%
is representative Bixby had asked about
enforcement

03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
03:55:05.990 --> 03:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions I'll just say representative
 
03:55:08.070 --> 03:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
Bisby I am not an expert on those
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
provisions of the statute but I'm happy
 
03:55:11.229 --> 03:55:11.239 align:start position:0%
to provide you that language I can send
 
03:55:13.630 --> 03:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
you a link to that if that would satisfy
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
you I can probably find it online thanks
 
03:55:19.630 --> 03:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
um there was also a question about what
 
03:55:25.149 --> 03:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
online resources exist uh and what Dees
 
03:55:27.870 --> 03:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
has already produced um Dees has posted
 
03:55:31.110 --> 03:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
a website that has a large uh variety of
 
03:55:33.510 --> 03:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
different waste types that are listed
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
and information on proper management and
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
Recycling and Disposal uh for home
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
owners businesses schools um and we do
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
have a page that's devoted specifically
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
to batteries um because they are there's
 
03:55:48.790 --> 03:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
so many different types of batteries
 
03:55:51.309 --> 03:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
there's so many different uh
 
03:55:53.670 --> 03:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
chemistries uh and one thing that I just
 
03:55:56.590 --> 03:55:56.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to note for the committee in some
 
03:55:58.990 --> 03:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the comments that have been
 
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
um made so far I think there might be a
 
03:56:04.189 --> 03:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion about lithium
 
03:56:06.950 --> 03:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
ion batteries versus lithium batteries
 
03:56:08.349 --> 03:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
and I I can understand the confusion
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
because they both exist lithium
 
03:56:14.590 --> 03:56:14.600 align:start position:0%
batteries tend to be non-rechargeable uh
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
they tend to be like the Button cell
 
03:56:18.309 --> 03:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
batteries or uh the things that are in
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
the greeting cards um those batteries
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
because they have lithium chemistry do
 
03:56:28.429 --> 03:56:28.439 align:start position:0%
pose fire risk uh lithium ion batteries
 
03:56:30.910 --> 03:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
on the other hand uh are rechargeable
 
03:56:33.030 --> 03:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
batteries so they're the kind that are
 
03:56:34.790 --> 03:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know associated with power tools
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
laptops cell phones on and on and on I
 
03:56:39.429 --> 03:56:39.439 align:start position:0%
mean they're ubiquitous uh and they just
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
seem to be a growing sector of uh the
 
03:56:46.830 --> 03:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
electric devices that we use these days
 
03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to note that for the
 
03:56:50.550 --> 03:56:50.560 align:start position:0%
Committees just for your edification
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
that this bill would ban disposal of
 
03:56:54.790 --> 03:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries however it would
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
not under under as I read it would not
 
03:57:00.469 --> 03:57:00.479 align:start position:0%
ban disposal of lithium batteries um so
 
03:57:02.910 --> 03:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that for the committee
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:09.590 --> 03:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions J
 
03:57:13.870 --> 03:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
boan bman thank you no problem it's new
 
03:57:15.429 --> 03:57:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my first question
 
03:57:21.349 --> 03:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
I think I share it um is why sorry why
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
aren't lithium batteries a part of it or
 
03:57:26.830 --> 03:57:26.840 align:start position:0%
or would would we want to add that would
 
03:57:29.429 --> 03:57:29.439 align:start position:0%
that fit in there uh does it make sense
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
to include that is what I'm
 
03:57:33.910 --> 03:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
asking uh that's not something I think
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
the department had considered prior to
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
me just being here and realizing that
 
03:57:38.910 --> 03:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
there was some you know you know in the
 
03:57:40.269 --> 03:57:40.279 align:start position:0%
conversation there was some confusion
 
03:57:41.710 --> 03:57:41.720 align:start position:0%
between these different types of
 
03:57:44.389 --> 03:57:44.399 align:start position:0%
batteries um that is something that I
 
03:57:47.790 --> 03:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
think the committee could consider um
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's not not something that I had
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
previously uh thought of followup yes
 
03:57:56.670 --> 03:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you sir um so there is a you
 
03:57:59.469 --> 03:57:59.479 align:start position:0%
would say there is a benefit to it then
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
I would say that lithium batteries pose
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
a fire risk the same that lithium ion
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
batteries do but they're smaller so
 
03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
they're not as um you know they they
 
03:58:10.389 --> 03:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
don't tend to they don't tend to be the
 
03:58:11.950 --> 03:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
the offenders necessarily in terms of
 
03:58:13.670 --> 03:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
causing fires but they do if you have
 
03:58:15.389 --> 03:58:15.399 align:start position:0%
enough of them you could potentially I
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
think the question is they shouldn't be
 
03:58:20.429 --> 03:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
put in the in the solid waste stream
 
03:58:22.830 --> 03:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
correct regular lithium batteries I
 
03:58:24.189 --> 03:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
think best management practice would
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
you're correct would be to separately
 
03:58:28.189 --> 03:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
manage them so that they're not mixed in
 
03:58:30.309 --> 03:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
with other refu and going into into
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
disposal at landfills or incinerators
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
follow up yes ma'am so if if you get the
 
03:58:40.110 --> 03:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill in front of you it says
 
03:58:42.030 --> 03:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
it has lithium on it and then it has
 
03:58:44.189 --> 03:58:44.199 align:start position:0%
Dash and that and that's ion so that
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
could be taken as both couldn't
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
it um I think in terms of how I'm sorry
 
03:58:54.030 --> 03:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
was that a question for me yeah sorry I
 
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
think in terms of how the terminology is
 
03:58:58.910 --> 03:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
used in the industry lithium ion is a
 
03:59:01.510 --> 03:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
specific batter battery chemistry so
 
03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
you'd have to add lithium as a line item
 
03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
you'd have to add lithium as a line item
on

03:59:05.030 --> 03:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:59:07.630 --> 03:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
here uh to to clar yeah if you wanted to
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
clarify to to cover those other types of
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries yes
 
03:59:12.239 --> 03:59:13.790 align:start position:0%
lithium batteries yes
okay

03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:59:18.910 --> 03:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh so there's the
 
03:59:20.790 --> 03:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
possibility that you know perhaps an
 
03:59:22.269 --> 03:59:22.279 align:start position:0%
amendment might be entertained that
 
03:59:23.950 --> 03:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
would allow us to distinguish between
 
03:59:26.429 --> 03:59:26.439 align:start position:0%
these two and include both of them uh in
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
in a ban but I would also imagine that
 
03:59:29.950 --> 03:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be worked
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
into the educational material uh right
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
because if you're talking about lithium
 
03:59:37.030 --> 03:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
batteries in greeting cards for example
 
03:59:39.149 --> 03:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
uh even though that is not a li ium ion
 
03:59:40.830 --> 03:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
battery which is explicitly covered by
 
03:59:42.269 --> 03:59:42.279 align:start position:0%
this legislation I would think it should
 
03:59:44.429 --> 03:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
certainly be an educational material
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
that is provided to encourage people to
 
03:59:52.030 --> 03:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
remove lithium ion lithium batteries um
 
03:59:53.349 --> 03:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
you know whenever they can before
 
03:59:55.030 --> 03:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
disposing of the
 
03:59:57.189 --> 03:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
packaging uh yeah that's a good point
 
04:00:00.110 --> 04:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
and um I I just want to add that
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
education around batteries is it can be
 
04:00:05.070 --> 04:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
super confusing for the public because
 
04:00:07.870 --> 04:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
you may have a button battery that looks
 
04:00:09.389 --> 04:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
the same as another button battery but
 
04:00:11.229 --> 04:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
they both have very different chemistry
 
04:00:14.469 --> 04:00:14.479 align:start position:0%
so it's just very confusing to really um
 
04:00:16.670 --> 04:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
to know what you're dealing with and so
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
education is always going to be key um
 
04:00:20.309 --> 04:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that's something that I think the
 
04:00:22.309 --> 04:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
department can definitely continue to
 
04:00:24.030 --> 04:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
improve on uh continue to try to
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
disseminate information we can work with
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
Partners like
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
nrra um I I think there's always
 
04:00:32.030 --> 04:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to improve our educational
 
04:00:35.030 --> 04:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
resources thank
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
you do I I have a a question
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
that this all makes sense to me you know
 
04:00:43.950 --> 04:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony understanding the
 
04:00:45.910 --> 04:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts the safety fire
 
04:00:49.309 --> 04:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
impacts why would we not approve this I
 
04:00:51.710 --> 04:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
mean there might be a cost at some towns
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
that aren't doing it today that's it
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
should be um outside of that why would
 
04:00:59.429 --> 04:00:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:03.830 --> 04:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
this um that's a great question I
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
I I'm not really prepared to speak to
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
that uh I guess
 
04:01:11.670 --> 04:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I okay it's it's an important
 
04:01:13.510 --> 04:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
safety issue that's that's one thing I
 
04:01:17.469 --> 04:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
can say cool thank you yes ma'am has the
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
department ever
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
considered because most of these things
 
04:01:24.550 --> 04:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
like you put it on a website you um you
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
know you put signage of course at a um
 
04:01:27.760 --> 04:01:28.630 align:start position:0%
know you put signage of course at a um
you

04:01:28.630 --> 04:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:01:33.309 --> 04:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
know um at the dump or um at a what's
 
04:01:34.950 --> 04:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
transfer station or something like that
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
so why not like something that's more
 
04:01:39.950 --> 04:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
publicly visible has the department ever
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
thought of doing education campaigns
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
like they do on other health related
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
things like Billboards and stuff like
 
04:01:48.269 --> 04:01:48.279 align:start position:0%
that because that's what people see
 
04:01:50.510 --> 04:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're driving like I just I
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
think I don't know it's very active that
 
04:01:55.950 --> 04:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
someone has to see a sign or go on to a
 
04:01:58.149 --> 04:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
website and it's just not common that's
 
04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
not what everybody's going to do when
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
they are bringing their trash to the
 
04:02:05.670 --> 04:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
dump or or having it picked up at their
 
04:02:08.590 --> 04:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
house yeah um that's a a great Point
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza I think um the
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
more visible you can make it the the the
 
04:02:16.349 --> 04:02:16.359 align:start position:0%
more audience you can reach um I will
 
04:02:19.229 --> 04:02:19.239 align:start position:0%
note that the department uh has recently
 
04:02:21.429 --> 04:02:21.439 align:start position:0%
developed a new section the section that
 
04:02:23.269 --> 04:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
I head up which is materials management
 
04:02:26.429 --> 04:02:26.439 align:start position:0%
education and planning uh related to you
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
know managing waste in more preferable
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
means uh by recycling or diverting it um
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
that being said we don't have a lot of
 
04:02:39.110 --> 04:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
resources available to to do things like
 
04:02:41.189 --> 04:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
posting Billboards or doing radio
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
campaigns I I think there is U potential
 
04:02:47.469 --> 04:02:47.479 align:start position:0%
value in that um but at this time we
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have the resources to
 
04:02:52.990 --> 04:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
Avenues okay fair enough thank you sir
 
04:02:56.469 --> 04:02:56.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
04:03:00.070 --> 04:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
testimony lastly I'd like to invite uh
 
04:03:03.429 --> 04:03:03.439 align:start position:0%
nage Grace
 
04:03:06.110 --> 04:03:06.120 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair n CES for the
 
04:03:08.670 --> 04:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
mun Municipal Association we support the
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
bill we support the bill we support the
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
amendment submitted by representative
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
eel and we would also support any
 
04:03:17.469 --> 04:03:17.479 align:start position:0%
amendment to include lithium batteries
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
or any other batteries that may cause a
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
fire um I will not repeat the lengthy
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
testimony you've already heard today um
 
04:03:29.189 --> 04:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to be very clear that um
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
given the fire risks associated with
 
04:03:36.309 --> 04:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
these types of batteries um and all of
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
the sources from IND industry that I've
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
heard from uh concur that the vast
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
majority of fires that they can trace
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
the origin to are caused by these type
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
of batteries um the cost associated with
 
04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with the aftermath of that far
 
04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
exceeds the cost of
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
disposal um obviously replacing
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
buildings um you know replacing
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
equipment for firefighters all of that
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
is very expensive it would be much it is
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
much cheaper to properly dispose of
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
these than it is to deal with aftermath
 
04:04:11.469 --> 04:04:11.479 align:start position:0%
of a fire um with that said I'm happy to
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
take any questions the Comm committee
 
04:04:13.319 --> 04:04:14.389 align:start position:0%
take any questions the Comm committee
may

04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
may
 
04:04:14.399 --> 04:04:16.990 align:start position:0%
may
have

04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you all right sir thank
 
04:04:23.550 --> 04:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:28.830 --> 04:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.790 --> 04:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
that is there anyone else that we missed
 
04:04:36.950 --> 04:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
on a pin card on
 
04:04:41.870 --> 04:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
this okay so uh we have 61 in favor
 
04:04:45.550 --> 04:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
online zero oppos with one neutral and
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
on the blue sheet we have
 
04:04:50.910 --> 04:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
three uh in favor of the bill and with
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
that I close the hearing on HB
 
04:04:59.670 --> 04:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
1386 and I'll open the hearing on
 
04:04:59.680 --> 04:05:01.550 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Ena committee it's nice
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be back here in front of the UNA
 
04:05:34.429 --> 04:05:34.439 align:start position:0%
committee I started out here a couple
 
04:05:37.229 --> 04:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
years ago you see some uh familiar faces
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
for the record my my name is Tony Kaplan
 
04:05:41.070 --> 04:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a representative from marac 8 the
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
towns of hener Bradford and Warner and
 
04:05:47.110 --> 04:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak on HB
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
1376 um HB 1376 intends to make it
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
unlawful to Market plastic containers or
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
bottles in our state is recyclable using
 
04:05:56.670 --> 04:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
the recycling
 
04:05:59.149 --> 04:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
logo at issue is the use of the logo
 
04:06:00.750 --> 04:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
along with the resin number of different
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
types of plastics according to the final
 
04:06:04.590 --> 04:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
report of the committee to study
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%

Management in New Hampshire cons
 
04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
consumers are often confused by all of
 
04:06:13.189 --> 04:06:13.199 align:start position:0%
the resin numbers and variations in form
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
that affect what can and cannot be
 
04:06:16.590 --> 04:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
recycled in their
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
Community the placement of the recycling
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
logo does not accurately represent
 
04:06:23.229 --> 04:06:23.239 align:start position:0%
recyclability as many Plastics do not
 
04:06:25.389 --> 04:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
have n markets and are not financially
 
04:06:26.670 --> 04:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
viable to
 
04:06:30.030 --> 04:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
recycle in fact only 5% of plastics are
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
recycled in the US the proportion that
 
04:06:35.469 --> 04:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
has been declining since 2018 when China
 
04:06:36.950 --> 04:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
announced it would no longer accept
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
plastic waste from from Western
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
countries according to the Federal Trade
 
04:06:43.870 --> 04:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
commission's green guide to marketing
 
04:06:46.229 --> 04:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
issued to ensure that claims made about
 
04:06:48.429 --> 04:06:48.439 align:start position:0%
environmental attributes of products are
 
04:06:51.469 --> 04:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
truthful and non- deceptive uh quote it
 
04:06:53.910 --> 04:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
is deceptive to misrepresent directly or
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
by implication that a product or package
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
is recyclable a product or package
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
should not be marketed as recyclable
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
unless it can be collected separated or
 
04:07:04.710 --> 04:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise recovered from the waist
 
04:07:06.750 --> 04:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
stream through an established recycling
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
program in other words it's not enough
 
04:07:11.149 --> 04:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
that a product theoretically is able to
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
be recycled in ideal conditions there
 
04:07:15.429 --> 04:07:15.439 align:start position:0%
have to be established programs for
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
recycling so HB 1376 states that a
 
04:07:20.229 --> 04:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
person shall not manufacture or
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
distribute a plastic container or
 
04:07:23.469 --> 04:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
plastic bottle with a chasing arrow
 
04:07:25.950 --> 04:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
symbol or label stating that the plastic
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
consumer good is recyclable unless the
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
recycling rate for that good or
 
04:07:32.830 --> 04:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
packaging is
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
75% American households produce around
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
51 million tons of plastic waste a year
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
more than in any other country much of
 
04:07:41.670 --> 04:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
that is either dumped in landfills or
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
incinerated often ending up in the ocean
 
04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
Plastics already contaminate the entire
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
planet people consume microplastics via
 
04:07:51.109 --> 04:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
food and water uh as well as by
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
breathing them in and the particles have
 
04:07:54.510 --> 04:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
been found in people's blood and bread
 
04:07:57.229 --> 04:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
and and breast milk all around the world
 
04:07:59.429 --> 04:07:59.439 align:start position:0%
according to a 2019 study Americans
 
04:08:01.269 --> 04:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
consider recycling to be more confusing
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
than understanding their taxes more than
 
04:08:05.550 --> 04:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of us incorrectly believe
 
04:08:07.349 --> 04:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
that any plastic item with a recycling
 
04:08:09.510 --> 04:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
symbol can be
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
recycled how much plastic is recycled in
 
04:08:15.229 --> 04:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire according to the 2021
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste report Dees calculates a
 
04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
Statewide recycling rate overall of
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
26% Based on data provided by the
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the report Dees states
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
that quote going forward New Hampshire
 
04:08:30.510 --> 04:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
Dees hopes to be able to collect better
 
04:08:32.309 --> 04:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
data to produce more comprehensive
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
estimates for recycling and diversion so
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping that this legislation on
 
04:08:39.389 --> 04:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
deceptive recycling claims would be a
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Spur to collecting such
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
data my brief comment on the fiscal note
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
attached to HB 1376 is if Municipal data
 
04:08:50.910 --> 04:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
is enough to estimate a Statewide
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
recycling rate then DS needs to explain
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
why collection of Municipal data on
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
plastic recycling compared to data on
 
04:09:01.630 --> 04:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
the composition of Municipal Way going
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
to landfills and incinerators would not
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
be enough to produce a plastic recycling
 
04:09:08.189 --> 04:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
rate for the various types of plastic in
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
the state why do we need itemized
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
recycling rates for every product which
 
04:09:14.550 --> 04:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
is the Assumption the fiscal n fiscal
 
04:09:16.710 --> 04:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
note seems to be based on so I'm hoping
 
04:09:18.630 --> 04:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
somebody uh from the DS will be up here
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
after me and and somebody gets to ask
 
04:09:23.550 --> 04:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
that question my guesses were probably
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
below the national average for plastic
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
recycling of 5% given that we recycle
 
04:09:30.670 --> 04:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
overall below the national average of
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
32% we're at 26% in which case the
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
recycling logo would be deceptive on all
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
types of plastic in New New Hampshire 1
 
04:09:41.790 --> 04:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
through 7 would this legislation kill
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
off recycling efforts by demanding the
 
04:09:47.349 --> 04:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
removal of the recycling logo not at all
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would still be able to
 
04:09:51.309 --> 04:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
make realistic claims of recyclability
 
04:09:53.670 --> 04:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
such as a label saying for instance this
 
04:09:55.750 --> 04:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
product may be recyclable check with
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
your municipal or state Solid Waste
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
Authority in summary all the bill is
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
asking is to protect New Hampshire
 
04:10:04.830 --> 04:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
consumers from fraudulent and deceptive
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
marketing this bill is intended to give
 
04:10:09.070 --> 04:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
consumers in New Hampshire a clear idea
 
04:10:10.830 --> 04:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
of what they're purchasing when they buy
 
04:10:12.830 --> 04:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles or containers and to
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
stop the misleading use of a logo that
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
benefits the bottom line of the Plastic
 
04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
industry at the expense of our citizens
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
and environment public health and the uh
 
04:10:23.950 --> 04:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
viability of our waste management system
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to answer any questions if
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
you have
 
04:10:31.149 --> 04:10:31.159 align:start position:0%
any oh my gosh everyone
 
04:10:34.630 --> 04:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
rep representative Jam thank you Mr
 
04:10:36.990 --> 04:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative kapan for
 
04:10:38.670 --> 04:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
your Tes morning for taking my question
 
04:10:40.510 --> 04:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use an analogy that I think
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
my my Republican friends will
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
particularly like President Reagan
 
04:10:46.990 --> 04:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
saying you know trust but verify isn't
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
this effectively what we're talking
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
about we trust that if they're going to
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
stamp this logo on this material that
 
04:10:55.710 --> 04:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
they are being truthful but we also need
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to verify the truthfulness of
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
these claims and and we talk a lot about
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
the importance of education for the
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
consumer in diverting waste uh
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
and having these kinds of emblems on the
 
04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
material is an important part of that so
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh you isn't that really ultimately what
 
04:11:14.910 --> 04:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
we're asking for here right is that if
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
somebody is going to make these
 
04:11:19.389 --> 04:11:19.399 align:start position:0%
assertions to the public through these
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
brands that we have the ability to
 
04:11:25.070 --> 04:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
verify the truthfulness of the claim
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely that that is basically the
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
essence of the bill is is you can't make
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
claims about you know the environmental
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
attributes of a product if those claims
 
04:11:36.269 --> 04:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
aren't uh aren't true and then you know
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
obviously this the correl to that is are
 
04:11:41.349 --> 04:11:41.359 align:start position:0%
they true or not and um as I said my
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
guess is that they're not true in New
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and so that is basically false
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
advertising and it not only hurts the
 
04:11:48.790 --> 04:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
consumer but it hurts the environment
 
04:11:50.429 --> 04:11:50.439 align:start position:0%
and it hurts it hurts the viability of
 
04:11:51.830 --> 04:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
our waste management system because of
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
the amount of plastic it allows people
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to use and consume a product
 
04:11:59.469 --> 04:11:59.479 align:start position:0%
because they're believing that it has
 
04:12:02.030 --> 04:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
attributes that it doesn't thank you
 
04:12:04.070 --> 04:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative Haskins thank you Mr
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
04:12:08.070 --> 04:12:08.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you Envision
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
something that would replace this that
 
04:12:12.670 --> 04:12:12.680 align:start position:0%
would delineate in other words if my
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
town is um willing to accept at the
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
transfer station ones twos and
 
04:12:22.830 --> 04:12:22.840 align:start position:0%
fives but the waste management company
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
that picks up traum complex only takes
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
ones and twos right how is the consumer
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
looking at products going to
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
determine what that product has in place
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
of the chasing arrows well right I mean
 
04:12:42.990 --> 04:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
that that that's the question is is I
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
mean I'm not trying to to stop you know
 
04:12:48.149 --> 04:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
recycling obviously I'm in favor of
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
recycling so what what does a consumer
 
04:12:52.070 --> 04:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
want to do with the you know this
 
04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
plethora of of products out there right
 
04:12:56.269 --> 04:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
now they all have the same label which
 
04:12:59.030 --> 04:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
is they're they're recyclable and so you
 
04:13:01.550 --> 04:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
know my suggestion is that maybe we
 
04:13:03.389 --> 04:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
replace that logo with something that's
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit truer such as maybe this
 
04:13:08.790 --> 04:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
product may be recyclable check with
 
04:13:10.510 --> 04:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
your local authorities in other words
 
04:13:12.910 --> 04:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
they can not just assume it's recyclable
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
go and find out if it is or not thank
 
04:13:20.429 --> 04:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.349 --> 04:13:24.359 align:start position:0%
Penza I love the idea of this bill but
 
04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
the the Practical nature of it is where
 
04:13:30.349 --> 04:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
I struggle right because I think I've
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
been saying this forever I used to you
 
04:13:34.189 --> 04:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
know it depends on where you live and
 
04:13:36.149 --> 04:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
and what they accept if you know one
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
town accepts one two two and three and
 
04:13:39.870 --> 04:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
the other one only accepts you know five
 
04:13:42.590 --> 04:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
six and seven because all of these
 
04:13:45.590 --> 04:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
products are made through big huge
 
04:13:48.910 --> 04:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
corporations mainly and so those things
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
that are getting stamped or molded in
 
04:13:53.830 --> 04:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
there would be no way that we could
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
police this though like well I mean
 
04:13:59.950 --> 04:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
actually the bill does enable I mean by
 
04:14:01.630 --> 04:14:01.640 align:start position:0%
having something in statute it would
 
04:14:03.309 --> 04:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
enable theoretically our attorney
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
general to take a company to court for
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
false advertising I mean will the
 
04:14:09.109 --> 04:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
Attorney General do that I don't know
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's a you know I don't have a crystal
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
ball but this is just basically an
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
enabling statute to say hey we can go go
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
after people who are misleading uh our
 
04:14:20.590 --> 04:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
our constituents and you know basically
 
04:14:21.990 --> 04:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping is that this sends a
 
04:14:25.109 --> 04:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
signal uh to maybe along with other
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
states I don't know if other states are
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
considering similar legislation but it
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
would definitely send a signal to people
 
04:14:31.950 --> 04:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
that you you know you may want to think
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
about doing something other than putting
 
04:14:36.670 --> 04:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
a false logo on your product
 
04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
representative NAB well thank you Mr
 
04:14:41.670 --> 04:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm sorry I waited until you
 
04:14:42.870 --> 04:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
were on
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
your well because representative poza
 
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
sort of asked my question which was you
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
know in this committee we um think about
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
how labeling just in our state
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
contradicts Federal labeling or labeling
 
04:14:54.910 --> 04:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
from other states and how that's
 
04:14:56.389 --> 04:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
actually workable I wonder if you have
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
talked to anyone and I don't even know
 
04:15:00.030 --> 04:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
who it would be in the state as to you
 
04:15:01.630 --> 04:15:01.640 align:start position:0%
know having labeling requirements that
 
04:15:03.550 --> 04:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
are different from surrounding states or
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
even from the entire
 
04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
country yeah I mean that that is a a
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
good question that's a legal question I
 
04:15:11.630 --> 04:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
am not prepared to answer that question
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think this basically this this
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
enables our attorney general to go after
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
companies within our court system within
 
04:15:23.429 --> 04:15:23.439 align:start position:0%
the you know local Superior Court uh and
 
04:15:25.710 --> 04:15:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh that is a that is a court case that a
 
04:15:27.389 --> 04:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
company no matter where their base would
 
04:15:29.790 --> 04:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
have to reply to
 
04:15:32.950 --> 04:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah representative Murray thank you
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you representative
 
04:15:36.389 --> 04:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
and welcome back to the committee um
 
04:15:38.510 --> 04:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's nice to see to you um I guess to
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
that end with my colleague sharing the
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
same um sentiments this is also an
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
internationally recognized symbol
 
04:15:47.590 --> 04:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not I agree with you it's
 
04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
frustrating sometimes and I hear from
 
04:15:52.070 --> 04:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
constituents as a parent with kid
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
products and and various other things I
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm constantly frustrated
 
04:15:59.950 --> 04:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
by what is actually recyclable and what
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
is not so I do worry a little bit about
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
sort of that same concept that we're all
 
04:16:07.750 --> 04:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
sharing um to that end and but I would
 
04:16:11.990 --> 04:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
also be curious to hear like what what
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
else would we do then if we have such a
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
widely recognized
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
symbol what what would the solution be
 
04:16:19.670 --> 04:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
well I
 
04:16:21.990 --> 04:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
mean I I think that's the problem is
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
that it's so ubiquitous and so widely
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
recognized and so misleading that it uh
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
you know it's a problem
 
04:16:33.790 --> 04:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
um so that would be my suggestion is
 
04:16:37.229 --> 04:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
to you know say you cannot continue to
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
use this logo that gives a false
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
impression of what um you know what
 
04:16:43.510 --> 04:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
people can do with this with this
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
product because it's it it really is
 
04:16:49.189 --> 04:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
practically not recyclable um and so why
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
should we allow an industry to continue
 
04:16:55.870 --> 04:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
to label something that's not
 
04:17:00.349 --> 04:17:00.359 align:start position:0%
true and representative Bixby yeah so um
 
04:17:02.870 --> 04:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a range of of what is
 
04:17:04.910 --> 04:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
recyclable and what isn't
 
04:17:08.109 --> 04:17:08.119 align:start position:0%
recyclable that kind of goes from one to
 
04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
seven but not in a not in a exact order
 
04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
of decreasing recyclability but if you
 
04:17:17.269 --> 04:17:17.279 align:start position:0%
have a bottle that says number one on it
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
then if you if that bottle gets to a re
 
04:17:24.149 --> 04:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
gets to the recycling plant it's going
 
04:17:27.950 --> 04:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
to be pretty close to 100% recyclable if
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
you get that number seven to recycling
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
plant probably not so much but it
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
depends on so many things about the
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
context I'm not quite sure how you
 
04:17:42.550 --> 04:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
divide that up and also if we didn't
 
04:17:44.630 --> 04:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
have those numbers how would we be as
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
people who Source separate be able to
 
04:17:50.590 --> 04:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
say what uh you know what do I throw
 
04:17:52.510 --> 04:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
into the what do I throw into the bin
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
that the at the transfer station that my
 
04:17:58.269 --> 04:17:58.279 align:start position:0%
community will get money for and what
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
should just go into the trash right well
 
04:18:02.030 --> 04:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's up to every Community every
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
Community has different uh markets that
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
they're that they have access to so I
 
04:18:08.590 --> 04:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
mean in my town you know we were uh
 
04:18:10.550 --> 04:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
recycling all sorts of plastic up until
 
04:18:12.189 --> 04:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and now we just take
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
number one and two uh and you know that
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
there was a transition there where the
 
04:18:19.149 --> 04:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
the people the transfer station had a
 
04:18:20.950 --> 04:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
hard time telling people hey you can't
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
you you can't recycle these anymore take
 
04:18:24.510 --> 04:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
back your yogurt containers that we're
 
04:18:26.469 --> 04:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
not recycling those so I mean it is
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
confusing um as to the as to the number
 
04:18:31.469 --> 04:18:31.479 align:start position:0%
yeah the statute states that it has to
 
04:18:34.070 --> 04:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
have a 75% recycling rate and that's a
 
04:18:36.790 --> 04:18:36.800 align:start position:0%
Statewide rate so it's not in your town
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
or in my town it's overall in the state
 
04:18:41.950 --> 04:18:41.960 align:start position:0%
is it reaching a 75% threshold and I
 
04:18:43.870 --> 04:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair threshold to be able
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
to say something is actually recyclable
 
04:18:48.990 --> 04:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
as if 75% of those products are getting
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
recycled I don't think you have to do it
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
product by product though I think you
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
can do it number one number two you know
 
04:18:58.229 --> 04:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
the one through seven so if you have you
 
04:19:00.429 --> 04:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
know 80% of number ones are being
 
04:19:02.670 --> 04:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
recycled then that is a a product that
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
can have the logo on it but number five
 
04:19:07.109 --> 04:19:07.119 align:start position:0%
there's only you know 8% of those are
 
04:19:09.070 --> 04:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
getting recycled they cannot have the
 
04:19:11.510 --> 04:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
recycling logo on
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
comp thank you Mr chair my question is
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
very simple can I have that copy of your
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
testimony please I'd be happy I'd be
 
04:19:22.670 --> 04:19:22.680 align:start position:0%
happy to share that with you
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative U yeah I'll email it to
 
04:19:27.710 --> 04:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
you I'll email it to the committee and
 
04:19:27.720 --> 04:19:31.030 align:start position:0%
you I'll email it to the committee and
representative

04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
penzo so I think it's been several years
 
04:19:38.149 --> 04:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
now but um I remember the like if you
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
buy a you know let's say it's a box of
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
um or that's enclosed in plastic and
 
04:19:45.429 --> 04:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's usually number seven like let's say
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
if it's um pre-prepared Goods cupcakes
 
04:19:51.109 --> 04:19:51.119 align:start position:0%
or whatever um and that's seven those
 
04:19:53.389 --> 04:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
are never recyclable so and they have
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
that symbol I get it um wouldn't it be
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
better to be to do more of an education
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
campaign with people so they so it's on
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
a user end and maybe they're not
 
04:20:07.349 --> 04:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
purchasing things that are in in those
 
04:20:10.229 --> 04:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
plastic containers versus because I I
 
04:20:12.269 --> 04:20:12.279 align:start position:0%
just don't know how you could implement
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
this just because all of that stuff is
 
04:20:17.950 --> 04:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
coming you know really without our
 
04:20:20.349 --> 04:20:20.359 align:start position:0%
control yeah I am not going to deny that
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
an educa I'm never going to stand
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
against an any kind of educational
 
04:20:25.389 --> 04:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
effort I don't think you can wait you
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
know is this better or worse I'm an all
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
the above kind of person you know if
 
04:20:31.750 --> 04:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to attack a problem and uh
 
04:20:33.149 --> 04:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
throw everything you can at it that's
 
04:20:35.109 --> 04:20:35.119 align:start position:0%
the nature of this bill really I mean I
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't think this is going to solve the
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
plastic pollution problem
 
04:20:39.830 --> 04:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
single-handedly but it's just another
 
04:20:42.030 --> 04:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
way to attack the problem
 
04:20:44.109 --> 04:20:44.119 align:start position:0%
yeah represent
 
04:20:48.630 --> 04:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
Duty yes thank you um so I have this
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
aggravation in my life okay where I buy
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of bird seed from the natural
 
04:20:58.189 --> 04:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
Farmers Exchange and all of them have a
 
04:21:01.229 --> 04:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
number five recyclable on them so the
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
big the big bags so I went to recycle
 
04:21:08.229 --> 04:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
them of course don't take those in NASA
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
so I called the company and said great
 
04:21:12.109 --> 04:21:12.119 align:start position:0%
you've got this recycling label on it
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
where do I recycle it so they said oh
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
well in New Hampshire you go to gtown
 
04:21:19.109 --> 04:21:19.119 align:start position:0%
because the Goffstown transfer station
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
will take them so I call the gtown
 
04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
transfer station and they say we don't
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
have have absolutely no idea what you're
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
talking about so I went back to customer
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
service and I said okay there's no place
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
that I can recycle them why do you tell
 
04:21:35.710 --> 04:21:35.720 align:start position:0%
me that I can recycle them and of course
 
04:21:38.429 --> 04:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
you know the answer answer no dead
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
silence okay I never got a response from
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
them so I'm saving all my bags and I'm
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
going to put them in a box and I'm going
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
to mail them back to the company because
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
that really really makes me quite upset
 
04:21:53.469 --> 04:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
but the question is is would this bill
 
04:21:56.630 --> 04:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
or do we have a way of handling that
 
04:21:59.950 --> 04:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
because in my opinion that's pretty
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
deliberate that that that's that's
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
pretty deliberate fra fraud so would
 
04:22:06.990 --> 04:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
04:22:10.990 --> 04:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
enhance my ability to report them to the
 
04:22:13.229 --> 04:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and maybe have
 
04:22:16.109 --> 04:22:16.119 align:start position:0%
them do something about it I would think
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
so uh representative Duty I mean uh this
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
bill would strengthen your case uh
 
04:22:23.870 --> 04:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
because you know from the get-go they
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
have a false label on their product that
 
04:22:27.870 --> 04:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
tells you that it's recyclable and you
 
04:22:29.149 --> 04:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
went through all these hoops I mean
 
04:22:31.189 --> 04:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
obviously their customer service is in
 
04:22:33.149 --> 04:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
line with that fraudulent you know
 
04:22:34.590 --> 04:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
misleading claim and they're they're
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
just repeating that but
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this would enable you in
 
04:22:40.349 --> 04:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
statute to say Hey you know this is
 
04:22:42.109 --> 04:22:42.119 align:start position:0%
false advertising and we should be doing
 
04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
something about
 
04:22:48.389 --> 04:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
ma'am I guess my question to you then
 
04:22:51.319 --> 04:22:52.109 align:start position:0%
ma'am I guess my question to you then
would

04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
be if an item like was just recently
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
described wasn't recoverable wasn't Rec
 
04:23:03.309 --> 04:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
capturable and technically then not
 
04:23:04.750 --> 04:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
recyclable by
 
04:23:08.670 --> 04:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
default should not be something else in
 
04:23:13.469 --> 04:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
place like an epr entity that would
 
04:23:16.070 --> 04:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
encourage manufacturers to ensure that
 
04:23:19.389 --> 04:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
the products are in some way on the back
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
end recoverable recyclable and not
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
landfill yeah I mean we know we have the
 
04:23:28.790 --> 04:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
represent sorry to interrupt you but I
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
mean there is the hierarchy right reduce
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
reuse recycle um this bill is aimed at
 
04:23:37.830 --> 04:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh reducing the use so is epr uh
 
04:23:39.429 --> 04:23:39.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I heard that bill went
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
down I don't know if who was in this
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
committee this morning but um so that
 
04:23:44.590 --> 04:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
that's no longer an option I mean would
 
04:23:47.070 --> 04:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
I be in favor of this over epr no
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
obviously not epr is is a very
 
04:23:53.469 --> 04:23:53.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh set of uh you know
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
standards for the for industry to
 
04:23:57.269 --> 04:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
rethink their their entire packaging and
 
04:23:59.990 --> 04:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the entire way they they do business but
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a little bit more focused
 
04:24:03.229 --> 04:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
it's just saying hey you know we have
 
04:24:04.870 --> 04:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
laws that protect consumers against
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
proel and advertising this is clearly a
 
04:24:09.429 --> 04:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
case that is misleading and fraudulent
 
04:24:11.870 --> 04:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
and will New Hampshire choose to do
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
something about it I don't know maybe
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
they will maybe maybe the Attorney
 
04:24:17.309 --> 04:24:17.319 align:start position:0%
General will just you know just s sit on
 
04:24:19.830 --> 04:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
it until people enough people complain
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they'll join with other states and
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
take a you know um a case against some
 
04:24:27.389 --> 04:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
company to as a as
 
04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
a as an example I I don't know but I
 
04:24:31.429 --> 04:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
just think that it's clear that we need
 
04:24:33.109 --> 04:24:33.119 align:start position:0%
something in in statute that protects
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
people from fraudulent
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:37.550 align:start position:0%
people from fraudulent
Behavior

04:24:37.550 --> 04:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
04:24:39.550 --> 04:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative H Haskins thank you Mr
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
chair just one quick question do we have
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
products that have the chasing arrows
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
and no
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
numbers that's a good question I don't I
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever seen that but I'm
 
04:24:54.510 --> 04:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to answer that really I
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
don't doesn't that mean that the
 
04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
consumer needs to be following the
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
number rather than the chasing
 
04:25:04.030 --> 04:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
arrows well I mean I think the whole
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
system is so complicated yeah I mean
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically maybe that's what the
 
04:25:08.830 --> 04:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
consumer ought to be obviously yeah the
 
04:25:10.830 --> 04:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
numbers are as important as the as the
 
04:25:14.109 --> 04:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
chasing arrow symbol but do consumers
 
04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
understand all those different
 
04:25:18.550 --> 04:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
distinctions I don't know thank you and
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative Murray uh thank you Mr
 
04:25:22.750 --> 04:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
chair and just to clarify I do want to
 
04:25:25.309 --> 04:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
um just make one mention while we're
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
here we we do have a commitment from
 
04:25:30.510 --> 04:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
this committee to further through an ad
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
hoc committee to address epr so I just
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you were aware
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
of that thank thank you represent
 
04:25:40.269 --> 04:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
yes all right representative thank you
 
04:25:41.870 --> 04:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
so much for your testimony and
 
04:25:44.590 --> 04:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
introducing the bill I'd like to call
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
please uh thank you Mr chair members of
 
04:26:04.469 --> 04:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record my name
 
04:26:06.030 --> 04:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
is Mike nor with the New Hampshire
 
04:26:08.109 --> 04:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
Services um while this bill seems well
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
intentioned and while the department
 
04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
certainly uh supports efforts to
 
04:26:17.429 --> 04:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
increase recycling of plastics we do
 
04:26:20.429 --> 04:26:20.439 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because of uh the
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
resources that would be implied for
 
04:26:24.630 --> 04:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
implementation um it would be
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
problematic from a resource standpoint
 
04:26:29.910 --> 04:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
um at the heart of this bill uh it's
 
04:26:32.510 --> 04:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
about regulating the consumer
 
04:26:34.590 --> 04:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
Marketplace uh which is
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
in it's a area that Dees doesn't
 
04:26:39.950 --> 04:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
currently have any resources devoted to
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
so in order to actually implement this
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill it would require probably pretty
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
significant uh boost of resources to our
 
04:26:50.590 --> 04:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
to our to the work that we do um because
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
there's a a myriad of consumer products
 
04:26:55.229 --> 04:26:55.239 align:start position:0%
that would be subject to this bill
 
04:26:57.630 --> 04:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
probably thousands of different types
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
of products that have that recycling
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
symbol stamped on them um everything
 
04:27:06.950 --> 04:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
from you know yogurt container ERS cups
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
and uh milk jugs water bottles uh things
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
that we can't even think of right now
 
04:27:13.670 --> 04:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's just so many different things
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
I'm and it changes all the time and we
 
04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
all go grocery shopping and we all see
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
the different packaging
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
um so I think just to to address one of
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
the comments that uh was brought up by
 
04:27:28.070 --> 04:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan in his uh
 
04:27:31.229 --> 04:27:31.239 align:start position:0%
introduction to the bill why would Dees
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
need to um assess this product by
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
product because ultimately in order to
 
04:27:39.189 --> 04:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
enforce this and imple implement this
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
effectively it would come down to
 
04:27:44.309 --> 04:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
assessing individual products uh
 
04:27:47.670 --> 04:27:47.680 align:start position:0%
because if a product is sold that has a
 
04:27:50.389 --> 04:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
stamp on it and does not meet the
 
04:27:53.309 --> 04:27:53.319 align:start position:0%
prescribed threshold for recycling uh
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
within the state the dees and with the
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
cooperation of the Attorney General's
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
office would have to uh pursue
 
04:28:04.070 --> 04:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement um so it would be the
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately implementation would come
 
04:28:08.550 --> 04:28:08.560 align:start position:0%
down to by product um the other question
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
that I think representative Kaplan had
 
04:28:14.070 --> 04:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
was um why couldn't Dees just assess you
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
know how
 
04:28:18.149 --> 04:28:18.159 align:start position:0%
many plastic bottles uh number one
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles versus number two
 
04:28:21.429 --> 04:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
plastic bottles are recycled Statewide
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
currently I mean while it would be nice
 
04:28:25.189 --> 04:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
to have this information currently Dees
 
04:28:26.870 --> 04:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't get that information on a
 
04:28:30.469 --> 04:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
specific material by material type um we
 
04:28:32.710 --> 04:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
get information from Solid Waste
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
facilities like Town transfer stations
 
04:28:36.670 --> 04:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
they submit their their annual facility
 
04:28:40.030 --> 04:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
report to us uh and they report an
 
04:28:42.109 --> 04:28:42.119 align:start position:0%
aggregate number for how much they've
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
recycled within the year that covers all
 
04:28:47.070 --> 04:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
different types of materials so Plastics
 
04:28:50.710 --> 04:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
paper cardboard metal uh you know metal
 
04:28:52.229 --> 04:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
cans and things like
 
04:28:54.990 --> 04:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
that so right now we don't have the
 
04:28:56.670 --> 04:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
information to really even say like
 
04:28:58.389 --> 04:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
what's the recycling rate for number one
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
pet or hdp or or
 
04:29:01.319 --> 04:29:03.070 align:start position:0%
pet or hdp or or
polypropylene

04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
polypropylene
 
04:29:06.030 --> 04:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
um so in order to implement this bill it
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
would take uh not only additional staff
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
at the department but probably also
 
04:29:13.229 --> 04:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
hiring some sort of consulting firm to
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
conduct a market analysis on a periodic
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
basis uh to really be able to implement
 
04:29:21.990 --> 04:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
this effectively uh because as I noted
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
the market changes periodically so if we
 
04:29:26.670 --> 04:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
did a market analysis you know after
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
after this bill becomes
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
effective uh it's not to say that that
 
04:29:31.159 --> 04:29:31.950 align:start position:0%
effective uh it's not to say that that
would

04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
be up to date five years down the road
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
um so that market analysis would have to
 
04:29:38.630 --> 04:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
be conducted on a periodic basis to
 
04:29:40.590 --> 04:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
really make sure that products being
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
sold within the New Hampshire consumer
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
Marketplace are adhering to the
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
requirements it it would also be
 
04:29:48.670 --> 04:29:48.680 align:start position:0%
necessary for Dees to collect more
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
information about what is the specific
 
04:29:54.309 --> 04:29:54.319 align:start position:0%
recycling rate of those individual
 
04:29:55.349 --> 04:29:55.359 align:start position:0%
products and
 
04:29:59.349 --> 04:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
containers um so I I think while the
 
04:30:01.630 --> 04:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
bill is certainly well intentioned and
 
04:30:03.070 --> 04:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's at the heart of it it's really
 
04:30:05.349 --> 04:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
trying to educate consumers about what
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
is isn't recyclable and create awareness
 
04:30:11.910 --> 04:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
um through labeling efforts um it's just
 
04:30:14.189 --> 04:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
not clear that the resources necessary
 
04:30:16.349 --> 04:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
to implement it would be best use of of
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
limited State
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
resources um the the other thing I just
 
04:30:22.750 --> 04:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention is
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
um there's a
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
effort within the the packaging industry
 
04:30:30.070 --> 04:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
right now it's a voluntary labeling
 
04:30:32.830 --> 04:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
effort called how to recycle many of you
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
if you're paying attention and trying to
 
04:30:35.910 --> 04:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how to recycle items you may
 
04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
have seen this it's a how the number two
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
recycle and then it'll often have um
 
04:30:44.030 --> 04:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
little explanatory labels on there
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
saying you know if it's got a a
 
04:30:49.870 --> 04:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
multi-layer pouch or something like that
 
04:30:52.109 --> 04:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
says do not recycle dispose of in trash
 
04:30:54.070 --> 04:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
versus the cardboard container that the
 
04:30:56.030 --> 04:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
pouch comes in that is something you can
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
recycle so there is an effort uh on a
 
04:31:00.670 --> 04:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary basis that consumer brands are
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
trying to to to participate in this how
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
to recycle effort to create more
 
04:31:08.630 --> 04:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
consumer awareness around what is and
 
04:31:10.189 --> 04:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
isn't recyclable in the products that
 
04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
they they distribute um but I'll say you
 
04:31:16.429 --> 04:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
know as somebody who's passionate about
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
Recycling and is you know obviously also
 
04:31:21.189 --> 04:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
a consumer it is frustrating at times
 
04:31:23.030 --> 04:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
when you buy products and it's not
 
04:31:25.149 --> 04:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
something that you can readily recycle
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh there's definitely a lot of
 
04:31:28.030 --> 04:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
complicating factors in this area so
 
04:31:32.830 --> 04:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
questions I just wanted to make a
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
statement for the record because um it
 
04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
happens a lot in this committee this
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
letter it's it's a question time okay
 
04:31:47.550 --> 04:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
statements are made in uh
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
deliberation representative
 
04:31:54.910 --> 04:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
BBY yeah so um i' have a question about
 
04:31:58.429 --> 04:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
um so if the numbers were removed from
 
04:32:01.149 --> 04:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
the packages wouldn't that make it even
 
04:32:03.790 --> 04:32:03.800 align:start position:0%
harder to track what was how much of
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.429 --> 04:32:10.439 align:start position:0%
um that's probably true uh I think
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
especially for the for the from the
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
consumer standpoint it would create more
 
04:32:14.990 --> 04:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
confusion around what to do with the
 
04:32:16.870 --> 04:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
item because if there's
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
no number like resin code on it uh it
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
might create a little bit of difficulty
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
in knowing exactly what to do with it
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
whether it is recyclable or not at least
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
the number code at least gives you some
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
pointers to like a a frame of
 
04:32:36.510 --> 04:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
reference um yeah so I think it could
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
potentially be problematic because
 
04:32:41.429 --> 04:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
Plastics can look alike even if they are
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
different actual resins like the
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
chemistry is different but they can look
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
similar you can have a clear uh number
 
04:32:52.189 --> 04:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
number one pet but you can also have a
 
04:32:57.429 --> 04:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
clear uh polystyrene number six um so
 
04:32:59.710 --> 04:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
there's there's definit definite
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
potential for there to be contamination
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
if if people are mixing the same kinds
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
of resins together to be recycled sorry
 
04:33:06.000 --> 04:33:07.109 align:start position:0%
of resins together to be recycled sorry
different

04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:33:12.510 --> 04:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:15.551 --> 04:33:15.561 align:start position:0%
question so do you realize that the
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner um is appointed by the
 
04:33:21.189 --> 04:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
executive branch and that the agency is
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
not allowed to take positions on
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
anything uh I'm aware that the
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
commissioner is appointed by by the
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
executive branch yes
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
followup so for a
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
followup so this whole letter that's put
 
04:33:42.990 --> 04:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
in is is great giving us information but
 
04:33:45.390 --> 04:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
did you realize that you can't say
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
oppose or or that you support a bill
 
04:33:50.789 --> 04:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
because of that because it's from an
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
agency that's a post that's positioned
 
04:33:55.470 --> 04:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
by the executive branch that that let's
 
04:33:57.670 --> 04:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
discuss this afterwards that this letter
 
04:34:01.551 --> 04:34:01.561 align:start position:0%
is from my knowledge it's it's a
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
authorized letter to send in and let's
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
discuss that words it says it right
 
04:34:09.189 --> 04:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
there in the first paragraph We oppose
 
04:34:11.429 --> 04:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm just I understand and I
 
04:34:13.150 --> 04:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
also believe that having read this
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
letter for four and a half seconds that
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
it is an authorized letter to put
 
04:34:21.949 --> 04:34:21.959 align:start position:0%
in so we can discuss it
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
afterwards and representative Murray um
 
04:34:27.150 --> 04:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair for taking my
 
04:34:29.310 --> 04:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Mr nort for also
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question in addition to the uh
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
numbers inside the chasing arrows logo I
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
also wonder what the implications might
 
04:34:38.949 --> 04:34:38.959 align:start position:0%
be and if you have any insight on what
 
04:34:41.429 --> 04:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
the implications might be to the toter
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
that go out to the curb that have the
 
04:34:44.470 --> 04:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
chasing arrows or any of those other
 
04:34:46.470 --> 04:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
types of things could that potentially
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
further confuse the
 
04:34:52.709 --> 04:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
efforts uh yeah um thank you represent
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
Murray that that's that's a good point
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's a large number of
 
04:34:59.390 --> 04:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
plastic items that do have the
 
04:35:03.590 --> 04:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
recycling chasing arrow symbol um mostly
 
04:35:05.949 --> 04:35:05.959 align:start position:0%
consumer products that are you know kind
 
04:35:08.189 --> 04:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
of quote single use and then intended to
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
be disposed of or recycled after use but
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
then there's a lot of durable goods like
 
04:35:17.189 --> 04:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned like toter um uh Furniture
 
04:35:21.510 --> 04:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
car parts uh there's a a large uh the
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
case on this microphone or on your
 
04:35:27.709 --> 04:35:27.719 align:start position:0%
computer at home um there's there's a
 
04:35:30.429 --> 04:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
lot of plastic that is used in the
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
products that we buy and not all of them
 
04:35:35.551 --> 04:35:35.561 align:start position:0%
have chasing arrows um I believe it was
 
04:35:37.830 --> 04:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan that mentioned 5%
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
of plastics is
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
recycled worldwide the plas of the
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
Plastics that we produce and put into
 
04:35:48.390 --> 04:35:48.400 align:start position:0%
the marketplace only 5% is
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
recycled that statistic is kind of
 
04:35:53.789 --> 04:35:53.799 align:start position:0%
changed over time it used to be 9% now
 
04:35:55.109 --> 04:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
they're saying
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
5% um one thing to keep in mind with
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
that statistic is that it's often used
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
in a misleading manner it's often used
 
04:36:05.349 --> 04:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
to conflate those consumer goods that
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
are intended to be
 
04:36:09.709 --> 04:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
recycled with all plastic items
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
including durable goods that are not
 
04:36:12.629 --> 04:36:12.639 align:start position:0%
intended they're intended to have a
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
longer life span um but those items were
 
04:36:17.390 --> 04:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
produced never thinking that they were
 
04:36:19.830 --> 04:36:19.840 align:start position:0%
going to enter in the consumer recycling
 
04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
stream um so it's it can be a little
 
04:36:24.551 --> 04:36:24.561 align:start position:0%
problematic to say that F only 5% of
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
recyclables are sorry only 5% of
 
04:36:30.789 --> 04:36:30.799 align:start position:0%
plastics are recycled because it doesn't
 
04:36:32.590 --> 04:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
that that's looking at the whole
 
04:36:35.910 --> 04:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
pie really
 
04:36:37.590 --> 04:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
the and people think that that means
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
that the F you know only 5% of the
 
04:36:41.429 --> 04:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
Plastics I put in my recycling bin get
 
04:36:44.109 --> 04:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
recycled the fact of the matter is most
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the Plastics that you put in your
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
recycling bin get recycled because
 
04:36:52.230 --> 04:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
probably 60 to 70% of the plastic stream
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
is number ones and
 
04:36:56.189 --> 04:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
twos by weight if you're just looking at
 
04:36:58.670 --> 04:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
you know the weight the mass of plastic
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
in the in the recycling stream and the
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
consumer products that we buy uh number
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
five is also probably you know good
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
five% or so uh and then all the others
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know threes fours five sixes and
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
sevens are a relatively small percentage
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
and those are the Plastics that don't
 
04:37:19.470 --> 04:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
they don't really have a market um so
 
04:37:21.150 --> 04:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
it's it's just important I'm just saying
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
just for for the committee's awareness
 
04:37:25.470 --> 04:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
that of the Plastics that we actually
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
put into a recycling stream the vast
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
majority do get
 
04:37:31.510 --> 04:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
recycled it's just the larger problem is
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
that there's so much plastic out there
 
04:37:34.789 --> 04:37:34.799 align:start position:0%
that when you look at that again the
 
04:37:37.390 --> 04:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
whole whole piie really we're only
 
04:37:38.789 --> 04:37:38.799 align:start position:0%
recycling a small percentage of the
 
04:37:41.310 --> 04:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
total amount of plastics that we produce
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
sorry represent muray that was kind of a
 
04:37:45.310 --> 04:37:45.320 align:start position:0%
a tangent but I hope that helped address
 
04:37:47.230 --> 04:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
your question appropriate thank you all
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
right any other
 
04:37:51.629 --> 04:37:51.639 align:start position:0%
questions all right sir thank you so
 
04:37:55.750 --> 04:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:01.670 --> 04:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:05.629 --> 04:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
that are there any other uh
 
04:38:07.230 --> 04:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
anyone else that would like to testify
 
04:38:09.269 --> 04:38:09.279 align:start position:0%
this I do not have a pin card
 
04:38:11.629 --> 04:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
on okay and if I can get the blue sheet
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
awesome next and there are four opposed
 
04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.629 --> 04:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
sheet on the blue sheet pink blue and
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
then uh online there are 24 supporting
 
04:38:48.429 --> 04:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
and four
 
04:38:52.349 --> 04:38:52.359 align:start position:0%
opposed and this concludes the hearing
 
04:38:54.429 --> 04:38:54.439 align:start position:0%
on HP
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:03.840 --> 04:39:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:18.189 --> 04:39:18.199 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:39:21.629 --> 04:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.070 --> 04:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
right and you closed out uh the hearing
 
04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
I did all right good enough okay thank
 
04:39:31.869 --> 04:39:31.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.629 --> 04:39:35.639 align:start position:0%
back here comes trouble all right um I'm

1681 which is relative to the sale of
 
04:39:44.628 --> 04:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
products labeled as biodegradable or
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
compostable and here today to introduce
 
04:39:50.350 --> 04:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to us is representative
 
04:39:52.788 --> 04:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
parshall welcome to environment

address
 
04:40:03.760 --> 04:40:14.110 align:start position:0%
address
that

04:40:14.110 --> 04:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.120 --> 04:40:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
right some point we're G have to address
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.718 --> 04:40:36.110 align:start position:0%
 
people

04:40:36.110 --> 04:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:40:38.670 --> 04:40:38.680 align:start position:0%

right
 
04:40:43.868 --> 04:40:43.878 align:start position:0%
this first of all I'd like to know for
 
04:40:45.948 --> 04:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
committee members do you all have a copy
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
1681 no okay I think we we may have a
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:07.150 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:41:07.150 --> 04:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.500 --> 04:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:41:28.150 --> 04:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.830 --> 04:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
one so we have we have the bill being
 
04:41:34.708 --> 04:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
handed out the original Bill and also a
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
copy of the amended
 
04:41:40.788 --> 04:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
Bill a proposed amendment proposed
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
amended Bill yes proposed
 
04:41:46.750 --> 04:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
04:41:49.788 --> 04:41:49.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your
 
04:41:52.868 --> 04:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
patience um so representative parall why
 
04:41:55.150 --> 04:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
don't you explain to us what the bill is
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
and what your amendment is yes I'll say
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
first that the amendment pretty much
 
04:42:04.110 --> 04:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
replaces all of the language in the bill
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh the spirit of the language remains
 
04:42:09.868 --> 04:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
however uh the amendment brings this
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
more in line with What legislation has
 
04:42:14.390 --> 04:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
been passed in other states and
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
effectively has been divorced in other
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
states it's a more successful document I
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
hope because of
 
04:42:21.320 --> 04:42:23.868 align:start position:0%
hope because of
that

04:42:23.868 --> 04:42:23.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
now mostly the original bill and the
 
04:42:29.948 --> 04:42:29.958 align:start position:0%
amendment it's a language Bill we uh use
 
04:42:32.110 --> 04:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
words like biodegradable and Co and
 
04:42:34.350 --> 04:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
compostable and even recycling they all
 
04:42:37.470 --> 04:42:37.480 align:start position:0%
get lumped in together
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
and when we say compostable we are
 
04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
talking about a particular product that
 
04:42:45.150 --> 04:42:45.160 align:start position:0%
we expect to break down under certain
 
04:42:47.948 --> 04:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances in a reasonable amount of
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
time uh as you know plastic is not in
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
that category but when we go into uh a
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
restaurant and then say that they're uh
 
04:43:00.910 --> 04:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
their service wear is compostable
 
04:43:03.070 --> 04:43:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody can make that claim what this
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill does that actually said say if
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to make that claim how are
 
04:43:08.270 --> 04:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
you going to back it
 
04:43:13.990 --> 04:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
up uh it restricts that language to
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
uh a certification
 
04:43:19.190 --> 04:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
process which
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh and I I will say one of the people
 
04:43:23.948 --> 04:43:23.958 align:start position:0%
who have helped me write the Bell was
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
that the uh oh my goodness BPI
 
04:43:28.550 --> 04:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
Laboratories as happened to be down in
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria earlier I got my BPI cup I
 
04:43:34.590 --> 04:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
know if I toss this into our compostable
 
04:43:37.910 --> 04:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
materials here it will get it will break
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
down under reasonable
 
04:43:42.670 --> 04:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances um and I think it's
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
important for consumers to know that to
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
be able to look for the label to know
 
04:43:48.590 --> 04:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
what is compostable and to be able to
 
04:43:50.910 --> 04:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
make those choices when they make their
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
purchases um why is this important we
 
04:43:56.868 --> 04:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
just had some wonderful Landmark
 
04:44:00.190 --> 04:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
legislation last year addressing large
 
04:44:02.350 --> 04:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of large compostable was
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
waste stream and I would just like to
 
04:44:07.310 --> 04:44:07.320 align:start position:0%
see that waist stream remain pure from
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh non-compostable materials and this
 
04:44:15.230 --> 04:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
bill will do as much um it doesn't ban
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
the use of or sale or distribution of
 
04:44:20.670 --> 04:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
plastic materials it doesn't ban the use
 
04:44:23.310 --> 04:44:23.320 align:start position:0%
of language such as recycling but it
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
does reserve the word compostable and
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
biodegradable to a certifiable
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
process and
 
04:44:34.470 --> 04:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh and while it's something which we
 
04:44:36.868 --> 04:44:36.878 align:start position:0%
could enforce on a federal level I think
 
04:44:38.590 --> 04:44:38.600 align:start position:0%
enforcing on a state level does make a
 
04:44:40.830 --> 04:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
lot more sense we have the feet on the
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
ground here within the state of New
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to enforce this kind of of
 
04:44:45.600 --> 04:44:49.708 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to enforce this kind of of
legislation

04:44:49.708 --> 04:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh and last there's a educational aspect
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
of the bill as I said I like the BPI
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
label on this there are other
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
Laboratories as well but there's a
 
04:45:03.550 --> 04:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
certain assurance that we get that when
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
we're buying a product produ that we
 
04:45:09.510 --> 04:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
expected to act act a certain way so
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
we've become the process of requiring
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
our large producers to compost now we
 
04:45:14.030 --> 04:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
need to help them out to ensure their
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
compostible materials free remains free
 
04:45:18.430 --> 04:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
from contaminants and this law hopefully
 
04:45:23.150 --> 04:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
does as much yes may I open myself up to
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:45:27.550 --> 04:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair I have a
 
04:45:31.670 --> 04:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
series of so if I ask okay thank you may
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
ask questions and any necessary followup
 
04:45:37.310 --> 04:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you I just wanted to be clear um
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
it seems that there are some
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
strikethroughs On Your sponsorship so I
 
04:45:41.868 --> 04:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that we're all
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
operating on the same premise can you
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that
 
04:45:47.868 --> 04:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
oh um I was
 
04:45:50.910 --> 04:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
not I would wager that these people
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
would still be happy to sponsor I my
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
understanding is that when you submit a
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill to be amended all sponsorship is
 
04:45:59.550 --> 04:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
stripped from it I see okay so I I I
 
04:46:02.150 --> 04:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
just took the liberty of doing that no I
 
04:46:03.830 --> 04:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody has deserted me
 
04:46:03.840 --> 04:46:04.830 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody has deserted me
person

04:46:04.830 --> 04:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:46:06.948 --> 04:46:06.958 align:start position:0%
so just one moment is this this
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
amendment actually gone through OS it
 
04:46:11.230 --> 04:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
has not because I know you're doing a
 
04:46:13.948 --> 04:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
work study next week on this and I just
 
04:46:15.070 --> 04:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it's as
 
04:46:16.750 --> 04:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive to answer your questions
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
as possible and so I think that it would
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
be better if we rather than submit
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment after Amendment if we could th
 
04:46:28.270 --> 04:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
address it all with them once in case we
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
find other things that need gotcha
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
repair whatever gotcha okay go ahead and
 
04:46:34.230 --> 04:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
represent Murray I'm sorry to have
 
04:46:35.948 --> 04:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
interrupted no no that's okay um and
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:43.430 --> 04:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
um does I don't see it anywhere but it
 
04:46:47.910 --> 04:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
may exist in these other sort of DS uh
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
d640 the numbers excuse meor there's no
 
04:46:54.910 --> 04:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
numbers on 339 colon 80 um is there
 
04:46:57.628 --> 04:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
anything that specifically talks about
 
04:46:59.670 --> 04:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
contaminants such as pasas or potential
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
other ingredients in quote compostable
 
04:47:06.548 --> 04:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
materials um no there is not but my
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.548 --> 04:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
certain certain things like uh past and
 
04:47:17.830 --> 04:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's aligned forever chemicals would
 
04:47:21.750 --> 04:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh item from being labeled as
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
certified as compostable to begin with
 
04:47:26.190 --> 04:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
according to their lab according to
 
04:47:28.590 --> 04:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
their Labs so that would be you know
 
04:47:30.910 --> 04:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
although the bill doesn't specifically
 
04:47:32.548 --> 04:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
and that RSA does not specifically
 
04:47:34.830 --> 04:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
mention anything about past for for or
 
04:47:37.470 --> 04:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
forever chemicals the certification
 
04:47:40.590 --> 04:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
process to get the compostable uh stamp
 
04:47:42.350 --> 04:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
serviceware um would preclude any forber
 
04:47:49.270 --> 04:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
chemicals being included in the lining
 
04:47:55.230 --> 04:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:59.070 --> 04:47:59.080 align:start position:0%
okay sorry representative Bixby yeah so
 
04:48:01.510 --> 04:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
um I think this might this followup
 
04:48:04.990 --> 04:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
might clarify um ref Murray's question a
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
little bit so uh you you cite ASM
 
04:48:12.030 --> 04:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
standards d64 6400
 
04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
d6868 and D
 
04:48:18.310 --> 04:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
8410 and my guess is that you haven't
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
memorized exactly what those those
 
04:48:25.708 --> 04:48:25.718 align:start position:0%
standards um require but um K you say
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
roughly if those standards are something
 
04:48:31.948 --> 04:48:31.958 align:start position:0%
that the um the American Society for
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
testing and materials uh have determined
 
04:48:41.590 --> 04:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
to uh compost uh to a um a clean to a
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
clean compost do a six-month breakdown
 
04:48:46.750 --> 04:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
with no plastic or microplastic residue
 
04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
I believe that's how it is and it's and
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's not that's the American on it's
 
04:48:52.070 --> 04:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is pretty much a world standard
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
yeah American Standards are similar to
 
04:48:55.910 --> 04:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
the world ones but oh you're absolutely
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
correct I have not memorize these I was
 
04:49:00.670 --> 04:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
just saying a the ASM because that's
 
04:49:02.590 --> 04:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
what you cited in the bill and that's
 
04:49:04.510 --> 04:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
the standard that you're saying we
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
should use and I appro I approve of
 
04:49:11.190 --> 04:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
you're putting that in rather than the
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
specific lab that would the BPI that you
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
have in in the original bill that's was
 
04:49:18.548 --> 04:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
one of the changes that actually BPI
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
suggested for the bill yeah
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
so representative dsy oh I'm sorry did
 
04:49:28.548 --> 04:49:28.558 align:start position:0%
were you finished I move on and okay
 
04:49:31.430 --> 04:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Duty thank you uh
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
representative parel I'm a little um
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
confused about the second paragraph
 
04:49:39.510 --> 04:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
under uh section
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
339 so are you saying uh and the reason
 
04:49:44.910 --> 04:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
I'm asking this is because I remember
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
getting uh something in plastic and it
 
04:49:50.230 --> 04:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
either had the word biodegradable or
 
04:49:52.788 --> 04:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
compostable on it so I put it in my
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
compost heap and I haven't found it
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
lately I think it took a year but I
 
04:49:58.590 --> 04:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
haven't found it lately so I think it
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
degraded but so are you saying here that
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
no plastic um can be labeled
 
04:50:09.510 --> 04:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
biodegradable uh because no plastic it
 
04:50:12.230 --> 04:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
really degrades is that what this is all
 
04:50:14.830 --> 04:50:14.840 align:start position:0%
about uh I'm a little confused yes if
 
04:50:17.948 --> 04:50:17.958 align:start position:0%
we're adding plastic to our composting
 
04:50:20.350 --> 04:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
material that plastic may break down
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
into microplastic but it will never
 
04:50:25.990 --> 04:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
actually degrade to the point of making
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
that soil making that compost a
 
04:50:29.360 --> 04:50:31.868 align:start position:0%
that soil making that compost a
commercial

04:50:31.868 --> 04:50:31.878 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:50:35.590 --> 04:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
product representative Co
 
04:50:38.548 --> 04:50:38.558 align:start position:0%
Kul thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:50:41.708 --> 04:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
uh building my question here so it says
 
04:50:45.548 --> 04:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
there is a misdemeanor penalty in this
 
04:50:48.190 --> 04:50:48.200 align:start position:0%
bill I'm curious who's going to jail is
 
04:50:52.750 --> 04:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
it the producer or the retailer of the
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
falsely labeled
 
04:50:55.200 --> 04:50:57.628 align:start position:0%
falsely labeled
biodegradable

04:50:57.628 --> 04:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
biodegradable
 
04:50:59.628 --> 04:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
container who's going to get in trouble
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
here for I would suggest that the person
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
that would get in trouble would be the
 
04:51:06.590 --> 04:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
person making the claim I should also
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
add thank you for asking me about that I
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
I I would also like to add that that's
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
pretty much stock language under all the
 
04:51:16.230 --> 04:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
penalties in this 80
 
04:51:16.240 --> 04:51:18.110 align:start position:0%
penalties in this 80
so

04:51:18.110 --> 04:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:22.150 --> 04:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
um uh sub chapters of that
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
339 uh RSA it's all they always refer to
 
04:51:27.750 --> 04:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
a guilty of a violation if a natural
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
person so it's that's stock language
 
04:51:31.868 --> 04:51:31.878 align:start position:0%
what the actual penalty they would
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
actually do I'll be frank with you I
 
04:51:35.830 --> 04:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
really don't know what the actual
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor penalty would be but uh I
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
would assume it' be the person that
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
would be making that claim if it's not
 
04:51:43.280 --> 04:51:44.548 align:start position:0%
would be making that claim if it's not
uh

04:51:44.548 --> 04:51:44.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:46.628 --> 04:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
certifiable so I hope that ansers your
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
question i' just like to point out that
 
04:51:51.628 --> 04:51:51.638 align:start position:0%
um seeing as this is not a document that
 
04:51:54.548 --> 04:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
has been vetted by the office of
 
04:51:58.110 --> 04:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
legislated services sort of huh that's
 
04:52:00.270 --> 04:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
very true yes uh so that this is just
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
your um stab at
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
initial thoughts of how the underlying
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
bill could be changed could be should be
 
04:52:17.310 --> 04:52:17.320 align:start position:0%
and um so the actual legal language that
 
04:52:19.230 --> 04:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
they would use is not something that's
 
04:52:21.310 --> 04:52:21.320 align:start position:0%
before us I think I'm understanding it
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
better that it's this it's the penalty
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's in this chapter 339 I think I'm
 
04:52:29.390 --> 04:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
getting it more now representative
 
04:52:31.868 --> 04:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
ger thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative parshall for taking my my
 
04:52:35.948 --> 04:52:35.958 align:start position:0%
question uh and it's already kind of
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
answered to an extent but my question
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
was going to be isn't the language that
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting already present in RSA
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
339 both with regard to the Penalty
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
which is under a misdemeanor but also
 
04:52:51.910 --> 04:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
with regard to for example
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
33961 which has to do with false
 
04:52:56.470 --> 04:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
representation uh which is under this
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
same chapter so in isn't this
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
effectively a a kind of a a a new
 
04:53:05.548 --> 04:53:05.558 align:start position:0%
iteration of something that already
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
exists within that RSA with the
 
04:53:10.030 --> 04:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
accompanying language yes I would I
 
04:53:11.310 --> 04:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
would agree with that because it is
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
false representation but this is a very
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
specific example of that type of false
 
04:53:18.190 --> 04:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
representation and other than that yes
 
04:53:20.910 --> 04:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
it is stock language uh from not only
 
04:53:24.390 --> 04:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
our own RSA but this Al also you know I
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
mean I've used model legislation in the
 
04:53:31.430 --> 04:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
past to draft legislation this is pretty
 
04:53:33.910 --> 04:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
much I would say almost rtim what has
 
04:53:36.390 --> 04:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
worked in five other states in including
 
04:53:39.070 --> 04:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland Minnesota Colorado California
 
04:53:42.788 --> 04:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
and Washington all have similar state
 
04:53:45.628 --> 04:53:45.638 align:start position:0%
laws that employ this very similar
 
04:53:48.548 --> 04:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
language may I followup followup yeah
 
04:53:50.750 --> 04:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and and so in addition to
 
04:53:52.430 --> 04:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
all of the other states wouldn't it be
 
04:53:55.628 --> 04:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
fair to say that this is a reflection of
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
a commitment based on the idea of false
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
representation that this legislature has
 
04:54:00.400 --> 04:54:01.510 align:start position:0%
representation that this legislature has
already

04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
endorsed yes I think it'd be a fair char
 
04:54:06.590 --> 04:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
Duty uh so representative parel um right
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
now we have um we have no laws regarding
 
04:54:19.948 --> 04:54:19.958 align:start position:0%
um labeling something biodegradable or
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
compostable or do we so this bill came
 
04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
about because there were um issues with
 
04:54:30.190 --> 04:54:30.200 align:start position:0%
people labeling things biodegradable but
 
04:54:33.230 --> 04:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
they actually weren't uh and I'll just
 
04:54:35.150 --> 04:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
say one other thing because you know I'm
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
I'm come from the world of uh ISO
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
standards and ik standards and um you
 
04:54:43.470 --> 04:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
know so a lot of times you'd have a seal
 
04:54:45.948 --> 04:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
you know and it would be ISO certified
 
04:54:48.070 --> 04:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
or something like that so this bill is
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
coming about because that doesn't exist
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that does not exist in
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it exists worldwide exists
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
in those five states that I previously
 
04:54:59.788 --> 04:54:59.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned and it does not exist on the
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
federal level um although the
 
04:55:05.590 --> 04:55:05.600 align:start position:0%
certification is something that people
 
04:55:08.830 --> 04:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
seek out obviously um the legislation
 
04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
came about I will tell you I was sitting
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
down with a friend of mine whose
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
business it is uh is to uh gather
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
compost in Kean New Hampshire I believe
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
our represent shman uses his services
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
like they like you put your recycling
 
04:55:23.868 --> 04:55:23.878 align:start position:0%
out your trash out you put your compost
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
out this young gentleman in his business
 
04:55:28.868 --> 04:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
come by and pick up the compost and they
 
04:55:32.470 --> 04:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
see that it goes to a high temperature
 
04:55:34.708 --> 04:55:34.718 align:start position:0%
um recycling Center which is really
 
04:55:36.628 --> 04:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
built perfectly for to break down these
 
04:55:39.270 --> 04:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
kind of materials and
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
um and it came up that that was one of
 
04:55:43.708 --> 04:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
the problems that he was facing was that
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
he's not getting sometimes he gets less
 
04:55:48.750 --> 04:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
than clean compostable material because
 
04:55:52.510 --> 04:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
there is an educational element that is
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
somewhat lacking and there's a
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
legislative element that would back up
 
04:55:58.030 --> 04:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
that educational element so that's kind
 
04:55:59.708 --> 04:55:59.718 align:start position:0%
of the Genesis of this whole situation
 
04:56:01.510 --> 04:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
there if that helps your
 
04:56:04.670 --> 04:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
thinking okay represent yeah thank you
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question could you just
 
04:56:10.590 --> 04:56:10.600 align:start position:0%
clarify for me um does this impact me
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
buying compostable cups at the store or
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
does it also include a restaurant that
 
04:56:17.310 --> 04:56:17.320 align:start position:0%
is selling you food in a compostable cup
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
it does not impact any of that if you
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
want to buy your
 
04:56:25.150 --> 04:56:25.160 align:start position:0%
non-recyclable plastic uh champagne
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
glass from the store this will not
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
affect that um but if that package
 
04:56:34.030 --> 04:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
contains a claim that it is compostable
 
04:56:34.040 --> 04:56:35.270 align:start position:0%
contains a claim that it is compostable
or

04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:56:37.230 --> 04:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
biodegradable then there will be an
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
effect on that this does not Outlaw any
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
particular kind of service wear okay
 
04:56:42.750 --> 04:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
follow I'd like to be very clear on that
 
04:56:44.030 --> 04:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually so thank you for asking
 
04:56:46.548 --> 04:56:46.558 align:start position:0%
representative NAB um so if I go to a
 
04:56:48.510 --> 04:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
Mexican restaurant and it says or even
 
04:56:49.990 --> 04:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
the works across the street like they
 
04:56:51.470 --> 04:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
have a compostable all our cups are
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
compostable you put it in the compost
 
04:56:55.948 --> 04:56:55.958 align:start position:0%
section is that are they being targeted
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
or is it somebody that rep that sells
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
something that's packaged as
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
biodegradable or
 
04:57:05.030 --> 04:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
compostable I
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
would hate to think that this is
 
04:57:10.350 --> 04:57:10.360 align:start position:0%
targeting anybody per se I would like to
 
04:57:12.150 --> 04:57:12.160 align:start position:0%
think it's Pi a different word but do do
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
you understand what I'm getting at I do
 
04:57:16.868 --> 04:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying at but um
 
04:57:19.868 --> 04:57:19.878 align:start position:0%
no it it's this is I see a law like this
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
is prevent the type of green washing
 
04:57:23.830 --> 04:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we sometimes witness where you know
 
04:57:25.510 --> 04:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
hooray for our side we're an
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
environmental company and we do things
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
this way and that way it's just
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
protecting the consumer and making the
 
04:57:33.910 --> 04:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
consumer aware that certain language you
 
04:57:35.510 --> 04:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
know that words matter and certain words
 
04:57:37.230 --> 04:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
do matter and I do believe the works
 
04:57:38.590 --> 04:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
everything product that they sell is
 
04:57:41.070 --> 04:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
compostable does contain the same BPI
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
label it's it's more common I think
 
04:57:45.190 --> 04:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
people really know so there's it would
 
04:57:48.548 --> 04:57:48.558 align:start position:0%
not be a big hurdle to educate people in
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
this area but uh and and and I don't
 
04:57:54.030 --> 04:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
have a better word than a Target but but
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
but I just had to make clear yeah I
 
04:57:59.430 --> 04:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
don't it's okay representative Bixby so
 
04:58:01.910 --> 04:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
I I think perhaps what uh we're trying
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
to get at here is
 
04:58:06.030 --> 04:58:06.040 align:start position:0%
uh where the point of enforcement is and
 
04:58:07.750 --> 04:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the point of enforcement
 
04:58:10.030 --> 04:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
is not the consumer nor is it the
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
retailer but rather the company that is
 
04:58:16.990 --> 04:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
packaging and making packaging and
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
labeling something as compostable so it
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
would be the producer of that that puts
 
04:58:26.430 --> 04:58:26.440 align:start position:0%
on a label that says compostable that
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
would have to B be able to back it up is
 
04:58:30.910 --> 04:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
that correct I think it' be hard to hold
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh the works as an example I what I Free
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
Press here liable when they buy a
 
04:58:40.990 --> 04:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
product that claims to be compostable
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
they find that it isn't but if they see
 
04:58:45.548 --> 04:58:45.558 align:start position:0%
their product is claiming to be
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
composable and they and they see that it
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
does not have that code they may have
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
say uh they want to see this on their
 
04:58:57.548 --> 04:58:57.558 align:start position:0%
product if they're going to make that
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
claim uh and I think it would be in
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
their preview to uh ask any of these
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
larger manufacturers to either have
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
their products certified or not make
 
04:59:12.590 --> 04:59:12.600 align:start position:0%
that claim okay follow up follow up okay
 
04:59:15.430 --> 04:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
so but what I what I'm getting at is
 
04:59:16.990 --> 04:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's going to be an
 
04:59:20.788 --> 04:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
enforcement action uh using the you know
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
using the enforceability that is in that
 
04:59:28.270 --> 04:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
chapter yes then uh the Attorney General
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
is going to go after the company that
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
stamps the compostable label on it that
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
is not backed up by third party testing
 
04:59:38.310 --> 04:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
as opposed to going after any retailer
 
04:59:40.190 --> 04:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
that has anything to do with it I would
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
hope so I I think that's where the uh
 
04:59:44.150 --> 04:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility should lie and I would
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
hope that would be the case okay thank
 
04:59:51.070 --> 04:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
you representive Duty um yes thank you
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh yeah the only thing if
 
04:59:55.628 --> 04:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
you're looking for for feedback that I
 
04:59:58.390 --> 04:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
would say is that I think for consumers
 
05:00:00.670 --> 05:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful if it says
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
biodegradable uh says something like
 
05:00:07.350 --> 05:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
meets um ASM standards you know or
 
05:00:09.990 --> 05:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
certified by something like that because
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
I think you know that uh one I think you
 
05:00:15.390 --> 05:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
know I would say it would be more
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
enforcable because they they've made the
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
claim that they're certified and they
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
have it on their label and I think from
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
a consumer's perspective it just adds um
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
verification and validity you know so I
 
05:00:32.270 --> 05:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
would like to to see maybe that added to
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
your Amendment some some kind of
 
05:00:37.470 --> 05:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
enhanced labeling yes I really not bring
 
05:00:41.868 --> 05:00:41.878 align:start position:0%
this as a may I you may okay I did I did
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
not bring this as a prop I I I guarantee
 
05:00:47.548 --> 05:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
it but I'm looking at it right now
 
05:00:49.868 --> 05:00:49.878 align:start position:0%
underneath my little BPI I know I'm not
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
asking you to try to see this but it
 
05:00:55.230 --> 05:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
says cert certifiable number it has the
 
05:00:57.150 --> 05:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
number of how it was certified so
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps that would be some very good May
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
that perhaps would be one change with me
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
you want to make on here you know or at
 
05:01:06.110 --> 05:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
least call awareness
 
05:01:09.150 --> 05:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
to now representative parall and we had
 
05:01:12.670 --> 05:01:12.680 align:start position:0%
a bill last year year before I don't
 
05:01:15.350 --> 05:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
remember anymore they just Mel into one
 
05:01:18.548 --> 05:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
another um having to do with um
 
05:01:21.190 --> 05:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
flushable wipes that claim to be
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
flushable but they're
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
not and that's kind of the same seems to
 
05:01:28.150 --> 05:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
me to be the same kind of issue where
 
05:01:31.430 --> 05:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
you have the producer of the product
 
05:01:33.470 --> 05:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
making a claim on their labor
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
05:01:36.000 --> 05:01:38.350 align:start position:0%
that is not
true

05:01:38.350 --> 05:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
true
 
05:01:38.360 --> 05:01:40.670 align:start position:0%
true
um

05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
how how I mean I don't I'm not
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
sure how that gets enforced with this I
 
05:01:51.628 --> 05:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
mean we we couldn't really enforce
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
something like that on the other Pro on
 
05:01:56.030 --> 05:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
the flushable
 
05:01:58.868 --> 05:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
products without having some sort of
 
05:01:58.878 --> 05:02:00.110 align:start position:0%
products without having some sort of
federal

05:02:00.110 --> 05:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:02:03.310 --> 05:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
labeling um correction being
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
made so I'm kind of don't
 
05:02:12.030 --> 05:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.948 --> 05:02:14.958 align:start position:0%
that I wish I could had an answer for
 
05:02:16.510 --> 05:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be very honest with you I wish I
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
could I'm not familiar with the eventual
 
05:02:22.948 --> 05:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
outcome of the flushable wipes but I see
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
that as another case of you know we're
 
05:02:27.750 --> 05:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
talking about greenwashing here making a
 
05:02:29.470 --> 05:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
claim on a product that's not actually
 
05:02:29.480 --> 05:02:31.310 align:start position:0%
claim on a product that's not actually
there

05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:02:34.430 --> 05:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I would not not
 
05:02:37.470 --> 05:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
expect a ton
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
of lawsuits around this particular issue
 
05:02:43.230 --> 05:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
I would really be surprised if there
 
05:02:46.750 --> 05:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
were I think most consumers now are be
 
05:02:48.510 --> 05:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
are educating themselves become very
 
05:02:50.990 --> 05:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
aware of the problems of compostability
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
and I think this would be an assurance
 
05:02:56.548 --> 05:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
to them that the product has has indeed
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
met a few standards so I see that
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
benefit coming from this um I think you
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
probably have to find somebody that was
 
05:03:07.390 --> 05:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
probably doing something very egregious
 
05:03:10.868 --> 05:03:10.878 align:start position:0%
in order to uh actually pull in any kind
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
of enforcement standards I'm not saying
 
05:03:16.548 --> 05:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't happen but I'm saying
 
05:03:19.070 --> 05:03:19.080 align:start position:0%
that I think you'd really have to I mean
 
05:03:20.830 --> 05:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
I think
 
05:03:24.110 --> 05:03:24.120 align:start position:0%
most 80% of the people who are producing
 
05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
these things I think have they want to
 
05:03:27.230 --> 05:03:27.240 align:start position:0%
do the right thing they're not doing it
 
05:03:28.990 --> 05:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
for the sake of green washing they want
 
05:03:30.310 --> 05:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure their product is
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
compostable and they're going to easily
 
05:03:35.708 --> 05:03:35.718 align:start position:0%
comply it's the you know 5 to 20% that
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have problems with and I
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
really think that if we can educate the
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
retail outlets such as the works is to
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
our need to have this uh
 
05:03:51.230 --> 05:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
certification I think organizations like
 
05:03:52.948 --> 05:03:52.958 align:start position:0%
that be very quick to jump on board and
 
05:03:55.110 --> 05:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
say no we don't want your compostable
 
05:03:56.750 --> 05:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
product not unless you can get a
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
certified compostable I believe but
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
again that's I will be quick to say it's
 
05:04:04.510 --> 05:04:04.520 align:start position:0%
speculation I really can't say for
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
certain any other questions from the
 
05:04:10.270 --> 05:04:10.280 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
none I invite Michael Nork from NHD yes
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
to come up and speak on this
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill sorry I forgot one thing I should
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
mention by the way go right ahead and
 
05:04:28.670 --> 05:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
now that you mentioned thank you so much
 
05:04:31.948 --> 05:04:31.958 align:start position:0%
um I did refer to this this bill
 
05:04:34.548 --> 05:04:34.558 align:start position:0%
originally was uh slated for another
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
section of the law Michael knor and his
 
05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh Dees were very helpful in suggesting
 
05:04:43.390 --> 05:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
that we move it to another place within
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
the law where it may be more clearly
 
05:04:48.548 --> 05:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
enforceable I believe but I believe he
 
05:04:50.670 --> 05:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
will speak to that that is one other
 
05:04:52.590 --> 05:04:52.600 align:start position:0%
change that is made in this amendment I
 
05:04:55.070 --> 05:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
just want to be very clear on that yeah
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
I noticed that this um sort of moves it
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
into Commerce territory yeah and we're
 
05:05:03.070 --> 05:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
not in this committee not really
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
um fluent in Commerce law so
 
05:05:11.270 --> 05:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
um kind of a little um concerned about
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
that aspect of this amendment but um in
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
any case thank you for br we sooner I
 
05:05:25.150 --> 05:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
yeah representive partial we need you to
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:31.480 --> 05:05:35.990 align:start position:0%
 
please

05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.230 --> 05:05:37.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and members of
 
05:05:38.830 --> 05:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
05:05:40.430 --> 05:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
is Michael norc with New Hampshire
 
05:05:42.070 --> 05:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
Services uh the written testimony that
 
05:05:47.310 --> 05:05:47.320 align:start position:0%
I'm handing out now was written before
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
we became aware that representative
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
partial was contemplating this amendment
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
that he previously handed out to the
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee um just to speak to that
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
briefly uh when Dees saw the original
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
draft of this bill we noted that it
 
05:06:09.708 --> 05:06:09.718 align:start position:0%
was placed in RSA 149 M27 which is a
 
05:06:13.190 --> 05:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
section of the statute that deals with
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
items disposed from items banned from
 
05:06:18.948 --> 05:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
disposal in landfills or incinerators in
 
05:06:20.868 --> 05:06:20.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that section of the
 
05:06:22.910 --> 05:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
statute is all about items banned from
 
05:06:24.990 --> 05:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
disposal but the subject matter of the
 
05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill was about distribution of products
 
05:06:29.310 --> 05:06:29.320 align:start position:0%
in the in the marketplace so we noted
 
05:06:31.548 --> 05:06:31.558 align:start position:0%
that that seemed to be inconsistent with
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
that section of the stat statute which
 
05:06:34.470 --> 05:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
is why we communicated to representative
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
parall that it seems like this is more a
 
05:06:40.990 --> 05:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
Commerce related bill so his Amendment
 
05:06:43.310 --> 05:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't necessarily change the
 
05:06:45.548 --> 05:06:45.558 align:start position:0%
content of the bill it just changes its
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
location and statute to be more in line
 
05:06:49.948 --> 05:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
with what the subject matter of the bill
 
05:06:54.750 --> 05:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
actually is um and so having said that
 
05:06:56.350 --> 05:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
the again the letter that I passed
 
05:07:00.070 --> 05:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
around noted that Dees uh opposed this
 
05:07:03.510 --> 05:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill um but we had written that before
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
we were aware that this this uh
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
amendment was in the works um if this
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
amendment were to be introduced after
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
after having briefly re reviewed it it
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
looks like it would address those
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had about its placement
 
05:07:18.590 --> 05:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
in statute about uh imposing
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities on Dees to enforce um
 
05:07:24.948 --> 05:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
so having said that I think um the
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
amendment would address the concerns
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
that the department originally
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
had um I just want to note very very
 
05:07:36.030 --> 05:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
generally that labeling of compostable
 
05:07:38.548 --> 05:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
products uh is something that has
 
05:07:39.868 --> 05:07:39.878 align:start position:0%
created a lot of confusion in the
 
05:07:43.708 --> 05:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
marketplace over the years um marketers
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
tend to use language very freely like
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
biodegradable or uh oxodegradable
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
or uh you know uh different type types
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
of terminology to imply that something
 
05:07:58.910 --> 05:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
will break
 
05:07:58.920 --> 05:08:00.990 align:start position:0%
will break
down

05:08:00.990 --> 05:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
05:08:06.548 --> 05:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
the having a standard for what is
 
05:08:08.548 --> 05:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
actually certified as composable would
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
help to reduce that consumer confusion
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
um it
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
would uh provide a you know a standard
 
05:08:18.590 --> 05:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
that people would be able to point to to
 
05:08:20.430 --> 05:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
say no we want it to be actually
 
05:08:22.670 --> 05:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
certified as compostable so that we can
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
be assured that if it goes to a facility
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
that can take it that it would break
 
05:08:26.920 --> 05:08:30.430 align:start position:0%
that can take it that it would break
down

05:08:30.430 --> 05:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
um I think just to to I was making notes
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
when the the committee was asking
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
questions earlier somebody I forgot who
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
asked about the language in the I'm not
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
sure are we rep um chair Ain are we able
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about the the language in the
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment or should we
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
stick to the language of the actual bill
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
is introduced well I guess we've kind of
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
already um introduced the possibility of
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment being um offered and
 
05:09:03.470 --> 05:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
presented to OS for some final um
 
05:09:07.030 --> 05:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
wording so I just the idea of the
 
05:09:10.830 --> 05:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I think is probably
 
05:09:12.270 --> 05:09:12.280 align:start position:0%
okay because we've already been talking
 
05:09:14.070 --> 05:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
about making that
 
05:09:17.868 --> 05:09:17.878 align:start position:0%
change um so sure thank you I just want
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
to clarify that's if that's acceptable
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
because I I believe somebody had raised
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
a question about the language saying no
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
plastic product may be labeled with the
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
term biodegradable degradable
 
05:09:29.670 --> 05:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
decomposable oxodegradable or similar
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
form of those terms I believe that Lang
 
05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
language is intended to address
 
05:09:37.310 --> 05:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
situations where somebody markets an
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
item as quote
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
degradable but really that there's no
 
05:09:45.750 --> 05:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
there's no standard to back that up I
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
think what
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
this bill would the intention here is to
 
05:09:52.670 --> 05:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that something is labeled as
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
certified compostable and that's the
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
language that would be used either it
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
meets that standard or it doesn't and
 
05:09:59.590 --> 05:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
they can't use other language that could
 
05:10:02.190 --> 05:10:02.200 align:start position:0%
create confusion among consumers things
 
05:10:04.910 --> 05:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
like biodegradable um because that is
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
current practice in the marketplace
 
05:10:09.788 --> 05:10:09.798 align:start position:0%
there are products I was looking at um
 
05:10:12.350 --> 05:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually of all things garbage bags um
 
05:10:13.590 --> 05:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
that say
 
05:10:15.548 --> 05:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
biodegradable uh and I was very confused
 
05:10:17.910 --> 05:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
by that because it it's going to go to a
 
05:10:20.350 --> 05:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
landfill where things don't really
 
05:10:23.470 --> 05:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
biodegrade anyway um so you know there's
 
05:10:24.990 --> 05:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different marketing
 
05:10:27.190 --> 05:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
ploes out there and so having a standard
 
05:10:29.270 --> 05:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
for something that is actually certified
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
as compostable provided is given the the
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
proper conditions for composting um I
 
05:10:37.350 --> 05:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
think you know that that would help uh
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
reduce consumer
 
05:10:41.708 --> 05:10:41.718 align:start position:0%
confusion um and the the standards the
 
05:10:46.350 --> 05:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
ASM standards d6400 d6868 and
 
05:10:50.430 --> 05:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
8410 um those are standards used by uh
 
05:10:53.628 --> 05:10:53.638 align:start position:0%
BPI which was previously uh mentioned by
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
representative parall um BPI the
 
05:10:58.830 --> 05:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
biodegradable products Institute um they
 
05:11:01.470 --> 05:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
are the industry leader on certifi like
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
providing third party certification for
 
05:11:06.670 --> 05:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh products that are compostable um
 
05:11:10.150 --> 05:11:10.160 align:start position:0%
they're kind of the gold standard uh and
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
they there was another question that one
 
05:11:13.548 --> 05:11:13.558 align:start position:0%
of the committee members brought up
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
about pasas being the presence of pasas
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
BPI has it as part of their standard for
 
05:11:21.628 --> 05:11:21.638 align:start position:0%
I can back up what represented parall
 
05:11:23.830 --> 05:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
was saying BPI has part of their
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
standard uh that products that they
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
certify cannot have presence of Florine
 
05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
greater than 100 parts per million
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh so they have a standard to try to
 
05:11:36.830 --> 05:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
address intentional use of uh
 
05:11:38.788 --> 05:11:38.798 align:start position:0%
fluorinated compounds like
 
05:11:42.830 --> 05:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
P um so I guess I'll leave it at that if
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's any questions from the
 
05:11:47.830 --> 05:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative Murray thank
 
05:11:49.750 --> 05:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair again yes and thank you
 
05:11:51.590 --> 05:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh Mr n for taking my questions one of
 
05:11:52.948 --> 05:11:52.958 align:start position:0%
the things that I did have questions
 
05:11:55.030 --> 05:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
around was between the difference
 
05:11:56.510 --> 05:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
between quote
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
biodegradable and compostable and my
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
understanding is that they are different
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
things and if you could speak to that a
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
little bit sure thank you for the
 
05:12:09.310 --> 05:12:09.320 align:start position:0%
question um yeah so compostable is
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
really more specific than biodegradable
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
or degradable um because a lot of
 
05:12:15.470 --> 05:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
products and
 
05:12:18.590 --> 05:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
materials can degrade over time because
 
05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
of exposure to UV or exposure to the
 
05:12:23.990 --> 05:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
elements um there there is some
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
decomposition that can happen um where
 
05:12:27.628 --> 05:12:27.638 align:start position:0%
products break down especially with
 
05:12:29.110 --> 05:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
plastics where they break down but they
 
05:12:30.830 --> 05:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
tend to break down
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
into pieces like smaller pieces of
 
05:12:37.190 --> 05:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
plastic um so the term composable is
 
05:12:39.190 --> 05:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
more specific it really refers to
 
05:12:41.750 --> 05:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
something that will break down in a
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
composting environment to the to the
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
point where there's no
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
recognizable fragments or pieces of that
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
product left after a certain period of
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
time after being exposed to composting
 
05:12:52.760 --> 05:12:53.948 align:start position:0%
time after being exposed to composting
uh

05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:12:58.590 --> 05:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
conditions um this actually just uh
 
05:13:01.910 --> 05:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
reminded me that uh there was some
 
05:13:03.510 --> 05:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
comment earlier about Plastics
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
specifically and whether they could be
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
certified as compostable the fact of the
 
05:13:08.628 --> 05:13:08.638 align:start position:0%
matter is yes that there are Plastics
 
05:13:10.430 --> 05:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
that can be certified as compostable and
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
that will actually break down uh through
 
05:13:13.920 --> 05:13:15.310 align:start position:0%
that will actually break down uh through
thermophilic

05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
thermophilic
 
05:13:18.628 --> 05:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
composting um and those Plastics are
 
05:13:22.270 --> 05:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
known as polylactic acid or pla um so
 
05:13:23.670 --> 05:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
there are like you'll see you know I
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
think even the works might have cups
 
05:13:28.390 --> 05:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
that are like a clear plastic but they
 
05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
are certified compostable so those items
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
if they were sent to a compos posting
 
05:13:33.750 --> 05:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
facility would break down even though
 
05:13:35.310 --> 05:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
they're plastic it's just a certain type
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
of plastic it's actually pla I just
 
05:13:40.590 --> 05:13:40.600 align:start position:0%
recalling from the previous uh hearing
 
05:13:42.910 --> 05:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
talking about Plastics recycling pla is
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.670 --> 05:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
sevens follow up yeah thank you madam
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
chair and to that end I guess um that
 
05:13:53.190 --> 05:13:53.200 align:start position:0%
was part of the the question that I did
 
05:13:54.788 --> 05:13:54.798 align:start position:0%
have was that I did notice that there
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
was like an ASM standard that talked
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
about just biodegration of plastics and
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's def
 
05:14:05.788 --> 05:14:05.798 align:start position:0%
5338 and so I didn't see that listed in
 
05:14:07.590 --> 05:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
here and I was just curious as to
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not there were other ASM
 
05:14:14.190 --> 05:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
standards that may fall in this area
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
that are not yet in this mixture here
 
05:14:20.510 --> 05:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I am by no means
 
05:14:22.430 --> 05:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
an expert on all of the ASM standards
 
05:14:24.190 --> 05:14:24.200 align:start position:0%
that exist there are innumerable
 
05:14:27.270 --> 05:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
different standards I believe that d6400
 
05:14:30.510 --> 05:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
is a general decomposition of packaging
 
05:14:34.990 --> 05:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
and that D68 68 and 8410 if I recall
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
correctly are targeted at items made of
 
05:14:41.110 --> 05:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
plastic so I think and I believe
 
05:14:42.750 --> 05:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
representative parall said that this
 
05:14:46.110 --> 05:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
language was recommended by BPI to try
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
to cover those kinds of potential
 
05:14:50.150 --> 05:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios where the product may be made
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
out of plastic or maybe made out of
 
05:14:54.910 --> 05:14:54.920 align:start position:0%
other materials um so I believe that
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
this is probably comprehensive there may
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
be other standards out there but I don't
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
think that BPI or other certification
 
05:15:02.670 --> 05:15:02.680 align:start position:0%
organizations necessarily
 
05:15:04.750 --> 05:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
use I'm sorry I I don't remember the
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:08.080 --> 05:15:10.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:13.110 --> 05:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay I'll uh I can look that one up if
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
you'd like and I can get back to you
 
05:15:18.230 --> 05:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
you I have a question first um and then
 
05:15:27.548 --> 05:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
you so my question is um if we were to
 
05:15:30.868 --> 05:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
consider drafting an amendment for the
 
05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill will similar to the
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
proposed ideas in what we see as an
 
05:15:41.230 --> 05:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
quote unquote an
 
05:15:43.590 --> 05:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
amendment do you think it would be
 
05:15:48.230 --> 05:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
helpful useful to actually um put in
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
definitions for each one of the things
 
05:15:52.750 --> 05:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about such as
 
05:15:55.590 --> 05:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
biodegradable degradable
 
05:15:57.590 --> 05:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
decomposable oxy
 
05:16:01.310 --> 05:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
degradable do you think we should have
 
05:16:01.320 --> 05:16:02.350 align:start position:0%
degradable do you think we should have
um

05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:07.708 --> 05:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:07.718 --> 05:16:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
terms

05:16:09.910 --> 05:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
terms
 
05:16:12.628 --> 05:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
um given the way this is written
 
05:16:16.788 --> 05:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
it's prohibiting use of that terminology
 
05:16:21.868 --> 05:16:21.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it would be helpful to
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
have a definition and because the the
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
intent here is to say that marketers of
 
05:16:28.788 --> 05:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
these products shouldn't be using that
 
05:16:31.270 --> 05:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
terminology they should be using uh some
 
05:16:34.310 --> 05:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
sort sort of label that gives uh
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
authority of a certifying like a third
 
05:16:38.948 --> 05:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
party certifying organization so I'm not
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
sure that it would be in my view helpful
 
05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
to have definitions of those terms if
 
05:16:46.830 --> 05:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
those terms are not intended to be used
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
by by the the marketing companies I
 
05:16:51.390 --> 05:16:51.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if that
 
05:16:51.400 --> 05:16:54.548 align:start position:0%
don't know if that
helps

05:16:54.548 --> 05:16:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:58.590 --> 05:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but you know my point is okay so
 
05:17:01.948 --> 05:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
this is saying that Plastic Products can
 
05:17:05.070 --> 05:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
never fall into those
 
05:17:07.390 --> 05:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
categories apparently that's they can't
 
05:17:09.948 --> 05:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
be labeled using that terminology right
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
right so since they can't fall into
 
05:17:15.190 --> 05:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
those categories they can't be labeled
 
05:17:18.510 --> 05:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
as such but I think just for intent for
 
05:17:21.070 --> 05:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
for the law
 
05:17:25.350 --> 05:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
itself um it might be worthwhile
 
05:17:28.390 --> 05:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
to have a definition of what those terms
 
05:17:32.788 --> 05:17:32.798 align:start position:0%
mean so that we do know that Plastics
 
05:17:36.708 --> 05:17:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
terminologies that's the committee's
 
05:17:41.510 --> 05:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
prerogative obviously um I I don't have
 
05:17:43.070 --> 05:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
a strong opinion one way or the other I
 
05:17:45.430 --> 05:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
was just expressing my offthe cuff okay
 
05:17:47.750 --> 05:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of in my impression that it
 
05:17:49.948 --> 05:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be necessary but it's
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
obviously your prerogative
 
05:17:53.788 --> 05:17:53.798 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so I was
 
05:17:56.470 --> 05:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
wondering um if we are if we do a work
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
session on this uh in order to amend it
 
05:18:01.430 --> 05:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh would it be possible for you to be a
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
available that uh at that point uh to us
 
05:18:07.590 --> 05:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
to um give us further advice so that we
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
don't like fall down any un unseen pits
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
or anything uh absolutely we'd be happy
 
05:18:17.070 --> 05:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
to to coordinate with a a a subcommittee
 
05:18:19.270 --> 05:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
or the committee as a whole great thank
 
05:18:21.230 --> 05:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:18:25.070 --> 05:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
Katon thank you madam chair just I lost
 
05:18:30.948 --> 05:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
you I think um under the amendment it
 
05:18:32.830 --> 05:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
said no no plastic product may be
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
labeled but then you talked about pla
 
05:18:38.030 --> 05:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
that were in fact
 
05:18:40.390 --> 05:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
compostable and so are there exceptions
 
05:18:43.350 --> 05:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
to this paragraph that we should include
 
05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
or I mean this is not accurate
 
05:18:51.788 --> 05:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
then to to your statement I I think you
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
rais a a good point representative Katon
 
05:18:55.708 --> 05:18:55.718 align:start position:0%
that it's confusing
 
05:18:58.470 --> 05:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
um the I think the way to think about
 
05:19:01.830 --> 05:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is if a product is going to be
 
05:19:04.110 --> 05:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
marketed for with the intent that it
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
should break down for composting that it
 
05:19:09.788 --> 05:19:09.798 align:start position:0%
should be labeled in a manner that says
 
05:19:12.750 --> 05:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
it's certified for composting not using
 
05:19:15.430 --> 05:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
other terminology like biodegradable or
 
05:19:17.990 --> 05:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the fact of the matter is there are
 
05:19:21.868 --> 05:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
Plastics that can be
 
05:19:25.110 --> 05:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
composted and that that could meet
 
05:19:27.628 --> 05:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
the uh certification of a third party
 
05:19:27.638 --> 05:19:29.230 align:start position:0%
the uh certification of a third party
for

05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:19:31.830 --> 05:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
composting um trying to think of a
 
05:19:34.150 --> 05:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
better way to explain this B basically
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
there are Plastics that can be composted
 
05:19:37.708 --> 05:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
and then there are Plastics that cannot
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
be composted but that may be currently
 
05:19:41.030 --> 05:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:19:44.270 --> 05:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
marketplace uh they they may be marketed
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
as biodegradable or using some other
 
05:19:47.788 --> 05:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
vague terminology that makes it sound
 
05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
like they are um I think the intent here
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:19:55.150 --> 05:19:55.160 align:start position:0%
really make sure that the labeling is
 
05:19:58.070 --> 05:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
consistent and that there is a standard
 
05:20:00.830 --> 05:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
and that standard is set by a third
 
05:20:03.230 --> 05:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
party that has has authority to to to
 
05:20:06.590 --> 05:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
verify that these products are able to
 
05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
to be composted okay thank you thank
 
05:20:12.910 --> 05:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
you representative compto thank you
 
05:20:15.150 --> 05:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
question um so we're talking about
 
05:20:21.190 --> 05:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
compostable Plastics or
 
05:20:24.510 --> 05:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
plas do they contain
 
05:20:27.070 --> 05:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
pafs I don't know for certain but I know
 
05:20:30.670 --> 05:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
that uh those items that are certified
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
by BP
 
05:20:36.750 --> 05:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
Pi are because of their their rigorous
 
05:20:38.150 --> 05:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
system for
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
certification uh they make sure that the
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are not intentionally
 
05:20:44.030 --> 05:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
adding P or other fluorinated compounds
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
to the products so I can't say that
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
across the board that all pla doesn't
 
05:20:51.750 --> 05:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
contain past but I know that there are
 
05:20:53.310 --> 05:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
systems in place for the certification
 
05:20:54.430 --> 05:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
of those
 
05:20:54.440 --> 05:20:56.670 align:start position:0%
of those
products

05:20:56.670 --> 05:20:56.680 align:start position:0%
products
 
05:21:00.430 --> 05:21:00.440 align:start position:0%
to not to to limit the the possibility
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
that that could happen there could be
 
05:21:03.230 --> 05:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
products out there that are not
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
certified um that may contain
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
P any other
 
05:21:12.868 --> 05:21:12.878 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank

opposed but in your testimony you said
 
05:22:13.948 --> 05:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
that you would be for the amendment and
 
05:22:16.230 --> 05:22:16.240 align:start position:0%

okay I'm G to open up the hearing for HB
 
05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
1504 relative to architectural paint
 
05:36:06.868 --> 05:36:06.878 align:start position:0%
recycling and here to introduce the bill
 
05:36:09.868 --> 05:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
is our favorite representative parall
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
should I just put a 10 up here maybe uh
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
move in thank you thank you again
 
05:36:18.670 --> 05:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
05:36:23.750 --> 05:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
um this is a bill that came about before
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
the epr for packing bill which you exed
 
05:36:29.030 --> 05:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
earlier today um was even in a draft
 
05:36:29.040 --> 05:36:30.190 align:start position:0%
earlier today um was even in a draft
form

05:36:30.190 --> 05:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
form
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:37.628 --> 05:36:37.638 align:start position:0%
uh and I think it is something which is
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
long overdue for New Hampshire I think
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
that I go to my local transfer station
 
05:36:46.270 --> 05:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
and there is no clear mandate on how
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
from One Transport station to the next
 
05:36:50.430 --> 05:36:50.440 align:start position:0%
on how to deal with this problem uh is
 
05:36:51.430 --> 05:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
this a
 
05:36:51.440 --> 05:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
this a
solution

05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
solution
 
05:36:55.990 --> 05:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that it has worked
 
05:36:58.030 --> 05:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
effectively in other
 
05:37:03.470 --> 05:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:05.948 --> 05:37:05.958 align:start position:0%
and uh you know other than that I mean
 
05:37:08.350 --> 05:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know there there are a lot
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
of unknowns in this bill how much will
 
05:37:12.868 --> 05:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
it cost it's a that's a you know I mean
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
I think the financial note does a very
 
05:37:17.810 --> 05:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
good job of addressing those areas
 
05:37:17.820 --> 05:37:20.110 align:start position:0%
good job of addressing those areas
[Music]

05:37:20.110 --> 05:37:20.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:37:24.190 --> 05:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
um perhaps we need twofold legislation
 
05:37:26.548 --> 05:37:26.558 align:start position:0%
this under some other aspect aspect
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
which does include such things as
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
producer responsibility or organizations
 
05:37:32.670 --> 05:37:32.680 align:start position:0%
the other Bill did that this bill has no
 
05:37:35.990 --> 05:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
provision for that it does ask for the
 
05:37:38.948 --> 05:37:38.958 align:start position:0%
uh um producers of M these materials
 
05:37:40.230 --> 05:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
step forward and I always think that's a
 
05:37:41.868 --> 05:37:41.878 align:start position:0%
very essential part of all of this I
 
05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
think we do need to have the people are
 
05:37:47.430 --> 05:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
helping to create our waste need to be
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
more responsible and I think this bill
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
does a good deal on that but
 
05:37:56.310 --> 05:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
um I am sensitive to some of the bills
 
05:37:57.788 --> 05:37:57.798 align:start position:0%
deficits as well is what I'm trying to
 
05:38:01.910 --> 05:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
say and uh and with that I'll I I hate
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
to cut it short because I just to open
 
05:38:07.470 --> 05:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.670 --> 05:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
any um any questions from the committee
 
05:38:13.990 --> 05:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative NAB I just have a very
 
05:38:15.590 --> 05:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
basic question thank you what is
 
05:38:15.600 --> 05:38:16.948 align:start position:0%
basic question thank you what is
architectural

05:38:16.948 --> 05:38:16.958 align:start position:0%
architectural
 
05:38:20.350 --> 05:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
paint it's the technical term okay for
 
05:38:22.030 --> 05:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
the paint that that I just used last
 
05:38:24.030 --> 05:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
week to paint my living room it's you
 
05:38:25.510 --> 05:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
know that's basically what you buy off
 
05:38:28.590 --> 05:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
the shelf in your local paint store so
 
05:38:32.310 --> 05:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
not paint not l latex paint other latex
 
05:38:34.670 --> 05:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
oil if you you know people still it's
 
05:38:37.468 --> 05:38:37.478 align:start position:0%
you know all right thank you
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
whatever any other questions from the
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you so much
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
represent big just there you go um okay
 
05:38:51.628 --> 05:38:51.638 align:start position:0%
so I didn't do all of my homework so
 
05:38:53.510 --> 05:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
could you just give a kind of brief
 
05:38:56.468 --> 05:38:56.478 align:start position:0%
description of how this would work um
 
05:38:58.310 --> 05:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
well there's a stewardship program like
 
05:38:59.830 --> 05:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
with our the other build we've been
 
05:39:02.468 --> 05:39:02.478 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:39:06.548 --> 05:39:06.558 align:start position:0%
odium um sorry and
 
05:39:09.788 --> 05:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a stewardship program
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
attached to it uh the stewardship
 
05:39:14.070 --> 05:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
program will have manufacturers on board
 
05:39:16.190 --> 05:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
of that stewardship program they'll need
 
05:39:18.310 --> 05:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
to come up with endol life uh management
 
05:39:20.350 --> 05:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
process including the collection

05:39:40.468 --> 05:39:40.478 align:start position:0%

05:39:44.030 --> 05:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
collection sites right now
 
05:39:47.190 --> 05:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
of and Kean they were very
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
very my my home county Keen was very
 
05:39:52.150 --> 05:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
specific as to how we were supposed to
 
05:39:54.350 --> 05:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
deal with this type of thing and
 
05:39:56.430 --> 05:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
currently in my currently small town we
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
just dump a bunch of sand in it and tall
 
05:40:00.750 --> 05:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
into the
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
dumpster so there's a there's a variant
 
05:40:06.590 --> 05:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
on how these uh you know and this
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
removes a lot of that variance and I
 
05:40:10.910 --> 05:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be a value in of
 
05:40:14.190 --> 05:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
itself representative dsy uh thank you
 
05:40:16.510 --> 05:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
madam chairperson did you know I'm
 
05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to call you chairperson madam
 
05:40:21.830 --> 05:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
chairperson yeah so so I'll try to start
 
05:40:25.230 --> 05:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
doing that no fine you could call me
 
05:40:28.468 --> 05:40:28.478 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman um I I just want to say I
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
believe uh we have a person that's going
 
05:40:36.750 --> 05:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
to testify um that has um uh experience
 
05:40:40.070 --> 05:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
in uh seeing uh seeing this process work
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
out at a um conference that he went to
 
05:40:46.230 --> 05:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
so perhaps that might be the next step
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know that we could move this along
 
05:40:51.430 --> 05:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I I also understand there's a lot in
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
here that puts responsibility on to Dees
 
05:40:58.230 --> 05:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
so if I hear you correctly uh
 
05:41:00.670 --> 05:41:00.680 align:start position:0%
representative um this probably should
 
05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
go to uh an interim study so that we can
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
work with various stakeholders to work
 
05:41:08.430 --> 05:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
out the details is that correct yes I'm
 
05:41:10.548 --> 05:41:10.558 align:start position:0%
already very sensitive the DS needs for
 
05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
Staffing and INF fancing and I think
 
05:41:14.590 --> 05:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
that may have came out and perhaps I may
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
have damaged my testimony by admitting
 
05:41:18.868 --> 05:41:18.878 align:start position:0%
as much but yeah I I think maybe I would
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
be happily uh suspend the floor to give
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
the floor to there off thank you thank
 
05:41:31.430 --> 05:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
you anyone anyone else any other
 
05:41:35.070 --> 05:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
comments I know
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative paral
 
05:41:41.230 --> 05:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I had asked our committee
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
researcher to provide us with a document
 
05:41:47.310 --> 05:41:47.320 align:start position:0%
um giving us some information about some
 
05:41:50.110 --> 05:41:50.120 align:start position:0%
of the past uh legislation that was
 
05:41:52.868 --> 05:41:52.878 align:start position:0%
offered for architectural paint
 
05:41:55.750 --> 05:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
recycling and she had prepared that sent
 
05:41:58.390 --> 05:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
a copy to all of us so you might want to
 
05:42:00.990 --> 05:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
take a look and see what uh what had
 
05:42:04.070 --> 05:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
been proposed in the past what were some
 
05:42:07.670 --> 05:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the issues with it um and I think
 
05:42:11.430 --> 05:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting uh document that was
 
05:42:15.948 --> 05:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.030 --> 05:42:20.040 align:start position:0%

the Upper Valley Lake Sunapee Regional
 
05:42:54.510 --> 05:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission I'm here to neither
 
05:42:56.468 --> 05:42:56.478 align:start position:0%

05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
but just to provide some background
 
05:42:59.750 --> 05:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
information as to I've seen with
 
05:43:02.510 --> 05:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
architectural paint recycling um this
 
05:43:04.830 --> 05:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
past September I was able to go to a
 
05:43:06.628 --> 05:43:06.638 align:start position:0%
conference well let me backtrack here so
 
05:43:08.070 --> 05:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
at the regional Planning Commission one
 
05:43:09.628 --> 05:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
of the things that I do is I run our
 
05:43:11.310 --> 05:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
household hazardous waste collection
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
program uh we hold five events a year in
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
the Upper Valley in Lake Sunapee area uh
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
we take all of your chemicals your
 
05:43:20.628 --> 05:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
oilbased paints your batteries all your
 
05:43:22.070 --> 05:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
random stuff that you can't throw in the
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
landfill we'll take it and we work with
 
05:43:26.230 --> 05:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
the hauler to uh dispose of it
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
responsibly one of the most common
 
05:43:29.628 --> 05:43:29.638 align:start position:0%
requests we get is what do I do with
 
05:43:32.628 --> 05:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
latex paint uh and right now we tell
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
them throw some kitty litter in it dry
 
05:43:37.150 --> 05:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
it out and toss it in the trash not only
 
05:43:39.030 --> 05:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
is that I mean let alone the
 
05:43:41.030 --> 05:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
environmental impact of that is wasteful
 
05:43:42.548 --> 05:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
it's really wasteful especially when you
 
05:43:43.910 --> 05:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
have you know that much paint left at
 
05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
the bottom of your can uh this past
 
05:43:47.830 --> 05:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
September I was able to go to the North
 
05:43:50.548 --> 05:43:50.558 align:start position:0%
American Hazard North American hazardous
 
05:43:52.468 --> 05:43:52.478 align:start position:0%
materials management Association
 
05:43:55.390 --> 05:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
conference in uh Tempe Arizona and we
 
05:43:57.310 --> 05:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
were able to tour some facilities of
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
their uh Public Works facilities in
 
05:44:01.868 --> 05:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
Tempe Gilbert and Mesa and they in
 
05:44:03.628 --> 05:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
Arizona they have a very active paint
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
recycling program uh these cities uh run
 
05:44:08.350 --> 05:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
it they run it themselves at the city
 
05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
level um but it can be run in any manner
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
that you wish uh what they do is they
 
05:44:14.868 --> 05:44:14.878 align:start position:0%
have they just accept paint latex paint
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
of all types and they recycle it and
 
05:44:18.750 --> 05:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's very very simple in that they just
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
filter it out and mix it together and
 
05:44:23.190 --> 05:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
they they come up with h three colors
 
05:44:25.628 --> 05:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
they have white tan and gray because
 
05:44:26.948 --> 05:44:26.958 align:start position:0%
when you mix everything together that's
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
what you end up getting um I can see I
 
05:44:30.948 --> 05:44:30.958 align:start position:0%
saw in the you know in all three of
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
those cities they were able to use a lot
 
05:44:35.670 --> 05:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
of that paint for um their own U
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings uh especially you
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
know in Arizona the tan comes in very
 
05:44:41.948 --> 05:44:41.958 align:start position:0%
handy um but they were able to use it in
 
05:44:43.670 --> 05:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
things like graffiti cover up they were
 
05:44:45.830 --> 05:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
able to sell it at a very low price or
 
05:44:47.990 --> 05:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
give it away in some cases to community
 
05:44:50.270 --> 05:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
groups that uh either needed it for like
 
05:44:52.190 --> 05:44:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know a Habitat for Humanity house or
 
05:44:54.150 --> 05:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
something like that um so it went back
 
05:44:57.670 --> 05:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
into the community um and so what I just
 
05:44:59.070 --> 05:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
really wanted to share was and just kind
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
to make myself available for any
 
05:45:03.150 --> 05:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
questions I could answer um was just how
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
Frugal this is It's it fits with our you
 
05:45:07.390 --> 05:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
know our Yankee frugality here in New
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we don't like to waste
 
05:45:11.510 --> 05:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
things you know I go to my transfer
 
05:45:13.390 --> 05:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
station I see you know the the picket
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
pile and you can see what you can use
 
05:45:17.230 --> 05:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
and stuff and I know some places have
 
05:45:18.510 --> 05:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe a little Shelf with some
 
05:45:21.548 --> 05:45:21.558 align:start position:0%
latex paint you can get um but it's not
 
05:45:23.868 --> 05:45:23.878 align:start position:0%
a widespread program and I think that
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
just makes sense for someone for New
 
05:45:28.270 --> 05:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to participate in this um just
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
because of because of the uh efficacy of
 
05:45:34.590 --> 05:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
it um the other yeah the that's that's
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much what I had uh to say I'm
 
05:45:38.910 --> 05:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions about how
 
05:45:40.628 --> 05:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
I can answer the best I can how these
 
05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
pro programs work um in Most states it
 
05:45:45.868 --> 05:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
is under a dollar for a charge for a
 
05:45:48.310 --> 05:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
gallon of paint um which is it's not a
 
05:45:50.548 --> 05:45:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a tax it's not a fee it's it's
 
05:45:53.070 --> 05:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility that you are paying
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
for the cleanup of the product um you
 
05:45:57.350 --> 05:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
know and I think the highest one in the
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
nation is Vermont right now at a .92 and
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you looked at the price
 
05:46:03.548 --> 05:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
of uh a gallon of paint lately I just
 
05:46:05.670 --> 05:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
painted my one of my bathrooms recently
 
05:46:08.468 --> 05:46:08.478 align:start position:0%
and I 55 bucks for a gallon of paint so
 
05:46:10.310 --> 05:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
you know 94 cents on top of that is not
 
05:46:11.750 --> 05:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to break my bank it's not going to
 
05:46:13.030 --> 05:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
make me say I'm not going to buy that
 
05:46:15.430 --> 05:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
paint um it's just a matter of fact it's
 
05:46:17.270 --> 05:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of the responsibility I have in
 
05:46:18.708 --> 05:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
buying the paint and making sure that I
 
05:46:22.270 --> 05:46:22.280 align:start position:0%
clean it up at the end so um yeah that's
 
05:46:24.270 --> 05:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's all I have and happy to answer
 
05:46:25.910 --> 05:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
any questions I
 
05:46:29.070 --> 05:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
can represent Murray thank you Madam
 
05:46:30.230 --> 05:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:46:32.788 --> 05:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
question um so I I'd love to hear a
 
05:46:35.310 --> 05:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the the
 
05:46:35.320 --> 05:46:36.868 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the the
program

05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
and do you see there being a cost
 
05:46:41.788 --> 05:46:41.798 align:start position:0%
associated with running I know you're
 
05:46:43.270 --> 05:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
saying that the gallon of paint
 
05:46:46.110 --> 05:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
themselves cost a dollar um but are
 
05:46:47.390 --> 05:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
there any costs that you learned about
 
05:46:50.270 --> 05:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
or saw that were born to a department uh
 
05:46:52.788 --> 05:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
in the state for running the program not
 
05:46:55.230 --> 05:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily only in oversight is that it
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
would be so so if there was any cost
 
05:46:58.990 --> 05:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
associated with the direct oversight of
 
05:47:02.190 --> 05:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
this program um but the state was not
 
05:47:03.868 --> 05:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
collecting the paint the state was not
 
05:47:06.030 --> 05:47:06.040 align:start position:0%
you know filtering it or things like
 
05:47:07.750 --> 05:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
that um there was there was just an
 
05:47:09.190 --> 05:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
oversight of making sure that the
 
05:47:10.510 --> 05:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
companies were doing what they said they
 
05:47:12.628 --> 05:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
were going to do um in many cases they
 
05:47:14.350 --> 05:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
have a company that's contracted to kind
 
05:47:15.990 --> 05:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
of run the program for the whole state
 
05:47:17.590 --> 05:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
in many places it's a place called Paint
 
05:47:20.030 --> 05:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
care um they work with places like you
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
know your Sherwin Williams or Benjamin
 
05:47:23.948 --> 05:47:23.958 align:start position:0%
Moore that will they can take back all
 
05:47:26.110 --> 05:47:26.120 align:start position:0%
your used paint and then they pack it up
 
05:47:27.788 --> 05:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
and they ship it to paint care and paint
 
05:47:29.270 --> 05:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
care takes care of it
 
05:47:30.788 --> 05:47:30.798 align:start position:0%
and uh handles it out of you know
 
05:47:33.030 --> 05:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
wherever they have their facility they
 
05:47:34.830 --> 05:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
mix it and then they get it back to
 
05:47:39.390 --> 05:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:42.750 --> 05:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
so okay and oh and and the the the sear
 
05:47:44.350 --> 05:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
charge on top of you know the the the
 
05:47:45.948 --> 05:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
gallon of paint or the quarter paint or
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
the five gallon bucket of paint whatever
 
05:47:49.628 --> 05:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
you get that goes into the fund that
 
05:47:52.788 --> 05:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
paint care uses to run the program
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
follow up followup M can you tell me
 
05:47:57.868 --> 05:47:57.878 align:start position:0%
what that search charge generally was
 
05:48:00.350 --> 05:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
that like I said that's the 95 cents
 
05:48:02.190 --> 05:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
roughly like I said Vermont has the
 
05:48:03.390 --> 05:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
highest at around
 
05:48:06.750 --> 05:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
$192 is and they they are one of the
 
05:48:08.350 --> 05:48:08.360 align:start position:0%
highest and in talking to them because
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
they are such a small state they are
 
05:48:11.868 --> 05:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
just getting started with it and so they
 
05:48:13.670 --> 05:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
um they didn't have the critical mass
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
obviously they have like half the
 
05:48:16.030 --> 05:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
population of us so like they don't have
 
05:48:18.110 --> 05:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
the critical mass of of people
 
05:48:18.120 --> 05:48:19.310 align:start position:0%
the critical mass of of people
representative

05:48:19.310 --> 05:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:48:24.788 --> 05:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
Bixby so um are the collection sites um
 
05:48:27.628 --> 05:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
the uh like local transfer stations and
 
05:48:29.628 --> 05:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
recycling centers or are that retail
 
05:48:33.070 --> 05:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
stores or um or how does that work the
 
05:48:35.230 --> 05:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
nice thing about this type of program is
 
05:48:37.468 --> 05:48:37.478 align:start position:0%
you can set it up however you like um
 
05:48:39.310 --> 05:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
some states some states have it where
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
you like I said you go to a Benin more
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
anywhere you buy the paint you can also
 
05:48:44.910 --> 05:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
take it back um other states have it
 
05:48:46.990 --> 05:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
where your local transfer station would
 
05:48:49.270 --> 05:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
take it back um we run hazardous waste
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
collections so we would incorporate that
 
05:48:53.708 --> 05:48:53.718 align:start position:0%
into our hHw collections in saying we
 
05:48:55.510 --> 05:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
also take latex paint and then we would
 
05:48:57.350 --> 05:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
work with our hauler to separate excuse
 
05:48:59.150 --> 05:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
me separate that and get that to the to
 
05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
the right
 
05:49:03.868 --> 05:49:03.878 align:start position:0%
party represent Murray uh thank you so
 
05:49:06.030 --> 05:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
you you seem to be describing a
 
05:49:07.510 --> 05:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
structure at least with retail
 
05:49:08.830 --> 05:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
establishments that we heard about
 
05:49:11.430 --> 05:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
earlier today with regard to batteries
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
where you can take them to other uh
 
05:49:15.628 --> 05:49:15.638 align:start position:0%
establishments potentially and return
 
05:49:17.788 --> 05:49:17.798 align:start position:0%
batteries so it sounds similar with the
 
05:49:20.230 --> 05:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
paints yeah yeah very very similar to
 
05:49:21.548 --> 05:49:21.558 align:start position:0%
that it it all depends on how you want
 
05:49:24.270 --> 05:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
to set it up you know if if um you know
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
the paint uh manufacturers associate you
 
05:49:27.628 --> 05:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
know they didn't want to take it in at
 
05:49:29.788 --> 05:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
their retail stores we could it could be
 
05:49:31.030 --> 05:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
structured in the state to do it
 
05:49:32.590 --> 05:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
differently and to take it at you know
 
05:49:34.750 --> 05:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
local transfer stations or you know
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste collections or something
 
05:49:38.230 --> 05:49:38.240 align:start position:0%
like that um that's another way you
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
could do
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
it so I have a question do you think um
 
05:49:47.750 --> 05:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
a program like this could be
 
05:49:50.468 --> 05:49:50.478 align:start position:0%
run just by an entrepreneur who's
 
05:49:53.788 --> 05:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
interested in doing something like this
 
05:49:56.990 --> 05:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a state-run program and
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
that they kind of could the the hang-up
 
05:50:00.910 --> 05:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
ends up being is that there's no way to
 
05:50:03.270 --> 05:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
fund the recycling of the paint because
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't because you have to recoup
 
05:50:07.310 --> 05:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
some costs up front from when people buy
 
05:50:10.590 --> 05:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
paint um just taking in paint and then
 
05:50:13.750 --> 05:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
selling it as recycled paint is not it
 
05:50:15.350 --> 05:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
does not produce enough profit for them
 
05:50:16.868 --> 05:50:16.878 align:start position:0%
to do that so that's why you so the
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
state has to say it's okay to charge a
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
search charge you know a fee on top of
 
05:50:23.190 --> 05:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
the the sale of retail paint in order to
 
05:50:25.830 --> 05:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
pay for that program so while it is
 
05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
typically run by a third party a private
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
private business
 
05:50:31.110 --> 05:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
um it does require some State
 
05:50:33.590 --> 05:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
permissions I
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
see any other
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you so much
 
05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
good to see
 
05:50:44.670 --> 05:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
you I would like to call
 
05:50:53.070 --> 05:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:57.948 --> 05:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
nhds and before you speak I just wanted
 
05:51:03.468 --> 05:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
to let uh committee members know that um
 
05:51:06.150 --> 05:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Dees does have a
 
05:51:09.788 --> 05:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
page uh regarding how to dispose of
 
05:51:12.150 --> 05:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
paint uh they talk about water-based
 
05:51:15.430 --> 05:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
paints and uh oil lead based
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
solvent-based paint stains and varnishes
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh they have fact sheets and all other
 
05:51:21.150 --> 05:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
05:51:24.310 --> 05:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
information and that is on the dees
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
website um news and media hash blog hash
 
05:51:33.150 --> 05:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
paint so um with that I'll let Michael
 
05:51:35.468 --> 05:51:35.478 align:start position:0%
North talk thank you thank you madam
 
05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
chair thank you members of the committee
 
05:51:38.510 --> 05:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
again Michael norc with New Hampshire
 
05:51:39.990 --> 05:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
 
05:51:40.000 --> 05:51:41.708 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental
Services

05:51:41.708 --> 05:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
Services
 
05:51:44.468 --> 05:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
um the is not taking a position on this
 
05:51:47.708 --> 05:51:47.718 align:start position:0%
bill um and we you know we do understand
 
05:51:50.510 --> 05:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
that a paint takeback program would
 
05:51:51.910 --> 05:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
support goals in the solid waste
 
05:51:54.070 --> 05:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
management plan by removing latex paint
 
05:51:56.510 --> 05:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
from disposal as was described you know
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
folks drying it out and throwing it in
 
05:51:59.468 --> 05:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
the track
 
05:52:01.910 --> 05:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh and it would also decrease costs
 
05:52:03.628 --> 05:52:03.638 align:start position:0%
incurred by municipalities that have
 
05:52:06.948 --> 05:52:06.958 align:start position:0%
paint collection programs or um Regional
 
05:52:08.670 --> 05:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
collection programs like the one that uh
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
with the Upper Valley like sunap
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
Regional Planning Commission um so with
 
05:52:15.510 --> 05:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
those in mind uh you know we understand
 
05:52:17.510 --> 05:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
that those would be positive outcomes of
 
05:52:19.510 --> 05:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
a bill like this but we also have
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh the resources that
 
05:52:25.310 --> 05:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
would be necessary to implement uh this
 
05:52:28.390 --> 05:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written um it's true
 
05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
that this would be a stewardship uh or
 
05:52:34.350 --> 05:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
an epr kind of program and that uh
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
organization such as paint care would
 
05:52:38.788 --> 05:52:38.798 align:start position:0%
probably be the one implementing the
 
05:52:40.910 --> 05:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
actual program but Dees would have
 
05:52:42.948 --> 05:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
oversight uh and administrative
 
05:52:45.468 --> 05:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as outlined in the bill
 
05:52:48.190 --> 05:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh such as adopting administrative rules
 
05:52:50.750 --> 05:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing and and approving plans to
 
05:52:53.310 --> 05:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
establish the the takeback program uh
 
05:52:55.708 --> 05:52:55.718 align:start position:0%
assuring compliance by manufacturers P
 
05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
pursuing enforcement uh AAL valuating e
 
05:53:01.708 --> 05:53:01.718 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the program reviewing annual
 
05:53:03.270 --> 05:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
reports and also preparing and
 
05:53:05.270 --> 05:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
submitting reports to the general court
 
05:53:07.830 --> 05:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
so there's there is some administrative
 
05:53:09.948 --> 05:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
duties that Dees would have to undertake
 
05:53:11.430 --> 05:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't currently have resources
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
to do um this bill does not make an
 
05:53:17.310 --> 05:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation for funding for or or
 
05:53:19.468 --> 05:53:19.478 align:start position:0%
authorize the creation of new positions
 
05:53:20.788 --> 05:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
um so that's just the concern that we
 
05:53:23.390 --> 05:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
have is the the resources necessary um
 
05:53:25.190 --> 05:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
with that being said if the committee is
 
05:53:28.708 --> 05:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
looking to uh refer this to interim
 
05:53:31.628 --> 05:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
study as as had been suggested um Dees
 
05:53:34.270 --> 05:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
would welcome the opportunity to uh you
 
05:53:36.390 --> 05:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
know participate in that process and
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
provide input happy to take any
 
05:53:40.270 --> 05:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee thank you
 
05:53:42.708 --> 05:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you madam chair
 
05:53:44.190 --> 05:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question in
 
05:53:46.310 --> 05:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
the realm of thinking about um
 
05:53:48.468 --> 05:53:48.478 align:start position:0%
possibilities of of things would the
 
05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
department um or do you do you know if
 
05:53:53.270 --> 05:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
the department would entertain the
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
possibility of there being maybe a pilot
 
05:53:59.628 --> 05:53:59.638 align:start position:0%
of this to see if shorter term program
 
05:54:01.430 --> 05:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
rather than some standing up something
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
permanently initially to get it going as
 
05:54:07.468 --> 05:54:07.478 align:start position:0%
I don't know there's a lot that I heard
 
05:54:09.390 --> 05:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
in the previous person's testimony that
 
05:54:13.150 --> 05:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
I thought was um hopeful and it sounded
 
05:54:15.910 --> 05:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
like to a large degree was self-funded
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm curious to know your
 
05:54:20.070 --> 05:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts and
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe on that yeah I that's an
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
interesting thought um I don't think you
 
05:54:25.360 --> 05:54:26.750 align:start position:0%
interesting thought um I don't think you
know

05:54:26.750 --> 05:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:54:29.310 --> 05:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
without further context are specifics I
 
05:54:30.830 --> 05:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't think I can really
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
comment in a definitive way on that but
 
05:54:35.190 --> 05:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
I think that there are potentially ways
 
05:54:38.590 --> 05:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
to uh conduct pilot programs that are
 
05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
not not mandated or or voluntary um that
 
05:54:44.310 --> 05:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
are self-funded yeah it's potential yeah
 
05:54:46.390 --> 05:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
there there's potential for that and um
 
05:54:48.548 --> 05:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
we would certainly welcome any any
 
05:54:51.230 --> 05:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
efforts to reduce waste that's going to
 
05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
disposal or is otherwise recovered
 
05:54:58.590 --> 05:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
so okay any other questions
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you I call now
 
05:55:01.558 --> 05:55:04.030 align:start position:0%
thank you so much thank you I call now

silk from
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
wolfboro good
 
05:55:10.750 --> 05:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon thank you for
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak with you I have
 
05:55:17.510 --> 05:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
since 1990 been in charge of a hazardous
 
05:55:20.030 --> 05:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
waste for the town of wolfboro until
 
05:55:23.750 --> 05:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
2002 at which time we built a permanent
 
05:55:29.468 --> 05:55:29.478 align:start position:0%
site and um we have uh member towns of
 
05:55:30.830 --> 05:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
Alton and
 
05:55:35.230 --> 05:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
wolfboro and then we also accept waste
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
from anyone from away on a fee basis and
 
05:55:41.788 --> 05:55:41.798 align:start position:0%
we also a facilitator for small quantity
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
generators we do a lot of interfacing
 
05:55:47.430 --> 05:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
with Dees because people call
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
frequently deaths moving in moving out
 
05:55:54.750 --> 05:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
they get these big large quantities and
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
most of the household hazardous waste
 
05:56:01.590 --> 05:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
programs have a 10 gallon limit or 10
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
pounds 50 pounds whatever depending on
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
the size of the program and people
 
05:56:08.468 --> 05:56:08.478 align:start position:0%
cannot always get rid of all of their
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
products in a safe
 
05:56:13.110 --> 05:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
way I guess you all realize that it's
 
05:56:15.310 --> 05:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
never good to send somebody away not
 
05:56:16.990 --> 05:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
happy with something that will cost more
 
05:56:19.750 --> 05:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
to pick up and clean up than it will be
 
05:56:22.670 --> 05:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
to take safely so if you come to me and
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
you have 20 gallons if you're willing to
 
05:56:28.750 --> 05:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
pay for it we will take it
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
my program takes anything through our
 
05:56:35.830 --> 05:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
six days in wolfboro we have two
 
05:56:38.590 --> 05:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
Satellite collections in Alton we are
 
05:56:42.510 --> 05:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
only open when our wasti holler is there
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
our waste holler we get three-year
 
05:56:49.070 --> 05:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
contracts and renewal we are jumping 15%
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
this year Lakes Region Planning
 
05:56:55.310 --> 05:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
Commission their waste holler is jumping
 
05:56:58.990 --> 05:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
40% we need help here people
 
05:56:59.000 --> 05:57:00.628 align:start position:0%
40% we need help here people
and

05:57:00.628 --> 05:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:05.468 --> 05:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
while a 55 gallon drum for paint is not
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
as expensive as a 55 gallon drum of
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
pesticides for me to get rid of we have
 
05:57:10.798 --> 05:57:11.948 align:start position:0%
pesticides for me to get rid of we have
more

05:57:11.948 --> 05:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
paint John McDonald is my local rep who
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
lives down the street and I spoke with
 
05:57:19.990 --> 05:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
him about this back in the spring he
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
also is Chairman of the budget committee
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
and goes over my portion of the budget
 
05:57:28.628 --> 05:57:28.638 align:start position:0%
for our facility it's divided by between
 
05:57:31.868 --> 05:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
the two member towns he agreed that you
 
05:57:35.390 --> 05:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
know if we could find a way to get rid
 
05:57:38.150 --> 05:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
of that which is a really big portion
 
05:57:40.150 --> 05:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
and just for clarification we only take
 
05:57:42.510 --> 05:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
latex because that's hazardous we I mean
 
05:57:44.628 --> 05:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm sorry we only take the oil
 
05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
base because that's hazardous we don't
 
05:57:49.430 --> 05:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
take the latex and as someone testified
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
previously the way to get rid to latex
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
in most communities is to add kitty
 
05:57:57.868 --> 05:57:57.878 align:start position:0%
litter sand it goes into Solid Waste and
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
we pay by the ton to get rid of it we
 
05:58:04.910 --> 05:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
have just increased the weight of it to
 
05:58:08.150 --> 05:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
be disposed of but no one that I know of
 
05:58:10.990 --> 05:58:11.000 align:start position:0%
local towns around me will take a liquid
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
paint product I believe although I I
 
05:58:16.110 --> 05:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
don't know for certainty that it's
 
05:58:19.830 --> 05:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
because the cans if they're crushed leak
 
05:58:21.750 --> 05:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
someone comes whoever your waist toer is
 
05:58:23.708 --> 05:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's waste management or
 
05:58:25.708 --> 05:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
cassella they don't want this stuff
 
05:58:28.030 --> 05:58:28.040 align:start position:0%
leaking out of their dumpster on to the
 
05:58:29.788 --> 05:58:29.798 align:start position:0%
car behind them as they're taking it to
 
05:58:34.270 --> 05:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
their eventual you know resting place if
 
05:58:40.990 --> 05:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
I could find way to lessen my cost I
 
05:58:44.070 --> 05:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
could serve people better for the things
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
that cost more I went to Vermont with
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
someone from Dees and with Vicky Davis
 
05:58:51.670 --> 05:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
from Upper Valley Lake sopy Regional
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
planning to Vermont and we visited a
 
05:58:57.350 --> 05:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
couple of sites in the spring the one in
 
05:59:00.230 --> 05:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
Bur inton has an area where they take
 
05:59:02.150 --> 05:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
latex paint
 
05:59:06.430 --> 05:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
in they have people that open the cans
 
05:59:08.830 --> 05:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's two people open the cans check
 
05:59:10.868 --> 05:59:10.878 align:start position:0%
and see if the paint looks good they
 
05:59:15.190 --> 05:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
have 55 gallon drums blue red green
 
05:59:18.270 --> 05:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they have a 55 gallon vat at
 
05:59:21.310 --> 05:59:21.320 align:start position:0%
the end that is all one particular color
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just down to like three
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
colors they add mde and everything else
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
they bottle it up into can
 
05:59:30.390 --> 05:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
they sell it for $11 a
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
gallon it's a great way to use it up
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
it's very affordable for people Tim was
 
05:59:39.070 --> 05:59:39.080 align:start position:0%
just speaking about
 
05:59:41.430 --> 05:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
frugality and they have a waste toer
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
that comes and picks up the oilbased
 
05:59:47.310 --> 05:59:47.320 align:start position:0%
paint and any of the latex paint that is
 
05:59:47.320 --> 05:59:48.430 align:start position:0%
paint and any of the latex paint that is
not

05:59:48.430 --> 05:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:59:51.150 --> 05:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
recyclable the program is through paint
 
05:59:54.150 --> 05:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
care and Vermont as was testified
 
05:59:57.948 --> 05:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
earlier and the thing is is that the
 
06:00:00.750 --> 06:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
dollar or approximate a dollar whatever
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
the the little price on a gallon of
 
06:00:04.830 --> 06:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
paint is that goes into the fund to help
 
06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
take care of it and the manufacturers of
 
06:00:10.430 --> 06:00:10.440 align:start position:0%
paint it's a product responsibility for
 
06:00:10.440 --> 06:00:11.548 align:start position:0%
paint it's a product responsibility for
the

06:00:11.548 --> 06:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:00:13.270 --> 06:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers I've
 
06:00:16.990 --> 06:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
been doing this like I said since 1990
 
06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
1990 the state of New Hampshire had
 
06:00:21.590 --> 06:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
$200,000 for grant money to distribute
 
06:00:24.030 --> 06:00:24.040 align:start position:0%
among all hazardous waste collections
 
06:00:27.788 --> 06:00:27.798 align:start position:0%
that happen in a fiscal year 35 years
 
06:00:27.798 --> 06:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
that happen in a fiscal year 35 years
later

06:00:30.390 --> 06:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
later
 
06:00:33.628 --> 06:00:33.638 align:start position:0%
$200,000 we know I mean just forget the
 
06:00:34.948 --> 06:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
people that just came because of the
 
06:00:36.868 --> 06:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic to New Hampshire but we know
 
06:00:39.910 --> 06:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
that since 1990 the population of the
 
06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
state has grown exponentially and as it
 
06:00:46.670 --> 06:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
grew people renovated people built new
 
06:00:48.310 --> 06:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
people have increased the amount of
 
06:00:50.350 --> 06:00:50.360 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste we have in our state but
 
06:00:53.230 --> 06:00:53.240 align:start position:0%
we haven't increased a way to better
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
handle it with any assistance to the
 
06:00:56.440 --> 06:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
handle it with any assistance to the
towns

06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
06:00:59.830 --> 06:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
and this
 
06:01:03.070 --> 06:01:03.080 align:start position:0%
isn't anything except like a little fee
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
like if you get rid of your batteries
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
you get rid of your tires if you don't
 
06:01:08.948 --> 06:01:08.958 align:start position:0%
buy paint you don't you don't pay for it
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
and then the program is pretty much
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
self- sustaining I it's I've um listen
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
to our quarterly household hazard waste
 
06:01:20.150 --> 06:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
site coordinators meetings I've listened
 
06:01:23.230 --> 06:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
to people from paint care and they have
 
06:01:25.548 --> 06:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
it sounds like voluminous reports that
 
06:01:28.750 --> 06:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
they give back to the states to track
 
06:01:31.030 --> 06:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I just would really
 
06:01:34.110 --> 06:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
encourage your group to look into it
 
06:01:37.430 --> 06:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.390 --> 06:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
thought okay representative Murray thank
 
06:01:42.948 --> 06:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for taking
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
a question I just wanted to make sure I
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
heard you correctly in your testimony
 
06:01:48.910 --> 06:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
you said that paint care will do some of
 
06:01:50.708 --> 06:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
the leg work and the data of the
 
06:01:52.750 --> 06:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
collection they have to do accounting
 
06:01:55.830 --> 06:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
work and send it back to the state okay
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
and and not that it isn't a good idea
 
06:01:59.548 --> 06:01:59.558 align:start position:0%
that somebody at the state level doesn't
 
06:02:02.230 --> 06:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah but no I I understand so there is
 
06:02:03.548 --> 06:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
there is some additional reporting
 
06:02:05.310 --> 06:02:05.320 align:start position:0%
communication going on a lot yes from
 
06:02:08.270 --> 06:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
what I understand
 
06:02:11.390 --> 06:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
yes any other representative H
 
06:02:13.708 --> 06:02:13.718 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and thank
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
06:02:19.708 --> 06:02:19.718 align:start position:0%
um I'm very interested in this topic and
 
06:02:22.868 --> 06:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
I heard you say that um your waste huler
 
06:02:25.910 --> 06:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
fees have gone up
 
06:02:29.310 --> 06:02:29.320 align:start position:0%
15% and I think you said somebody else's
 
06:02:29.320 --> 06:02:30.190 align:start position:0%
15% and I think you said somebody else's
are

06:02:30.190 --> 06:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:02:34.468 --> 06:02:34.478 align:start position:0%
40% my waste holler is clean
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
hobbers the first year of our three-year
 
06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
contracts are always the most
 
06:02:42.590 --> 06:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
expensive the most expensive we've had
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
since 202 was a 10% increase the first
 
06:02:47.670 --> 06:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
year this year it's
 
06:02:51.350 --> 06:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
15% on top of the 15% is another
 
06:02:53.070 --> 06:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
percentage the second year and the third
 
06:02:55.750 --> 06:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
year on top of all that you get a
 
06:02:58.390 --> 06:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
recovery fee as well which during the
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic went as high as
 
06:03:03.670 --> 06:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
19.5% we were lucky we had it in our
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
contract for
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
13 Lakes Region Planning Commission uses
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
trbi as their waste holler that Rose
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
40% just so there's no misunderstanding
 
06:03:19.590 --> 06:03:19.600 align:start position:0%
we are build differently trbi Lakes
 
06:03:21.590 --> 06:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
Region Planning Commission has eight
 
06:03:24.868 --> 06:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
well seven or eight uh
 
06:03:28.628 --> 06:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
collections they have a specific fee
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
for a site regardless of which one it is
 
06:03:34.510 --> 06:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
if there's some kind of a threshold say
 
06:03:36.190 --> 06:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
if it gets over this is arbitrary but
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
say it gets over 200 people on a day
 
06:03:40.948 --> 06:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
then then the additional ones would be
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
more I pay because I have a Hazmat
 
06:03:48.310 --> 06:03:48.320 align:start position:0%
building I pay only for full containers
 
06:03:51.350 --> 06:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
that leave full 55 gallon drums full
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
Gaylords with 100 paint cans in it
 
06:03:58.628 --> 06:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
whatever so I also have to pay over
 
06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
$1,800 plus recovery fee just to get
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
them to my place it's very very
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
expensive wolfb is about 6,000 somewhat
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
people as does Alton and my budget is
 
06:04:12.478 --> 06:04:13.468 align:start position:0%
people as does Alton and my budget is
about

06:04:13.468 --> 06:04:13.478 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:04:16.910 --> 06:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:21.230 --> 06:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
$997,000 and we we don't waste
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
it sure it's it's just getting harder
 
06:04:27.868 --> 06:04:27.878 align:start position:0%
because the stuff is dangerous
 
06:04:32.350 --> 06:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
M indeed thank you okay any other
 
06:04:33.750 --> 06:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
