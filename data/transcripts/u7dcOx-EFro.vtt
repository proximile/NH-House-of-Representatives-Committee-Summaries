00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
it being a
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
couple minutes past 10 o'clock it's time
 
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
for us to get started
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
those of you in the audience and
 
00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
sitting and paneled
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
go through hb 103 fn because
 
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
it was scheduled for last hearing and we
 
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
just never got to it so we're going to
 
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that first there's
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
some issues to work through there
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then we're going to go into 1677.
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
now those of you who aren't on division
 
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.390 align:start position:0%
now those of you who aren't on division
three

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.430 align:start position:0%
three
for

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.710 align:start position:0%
for
103

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
103
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
i i respect you as individuals if you
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
have something you want to ask
 
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know go ahead i think if we have a
 
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
vote we'll probably limit it to the
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
folks from who are here representing
 
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
division three though
 
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.789 align:start position:0%
division three though
um

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
my goal
 
00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
get through 103
 
00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
in an hour or less
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
in order to do that
 
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to need uh the department to
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
to come up and and get us started
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
i think representative irf
 
00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
has spent a lot of time
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
working on an amendment and so
 
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
with with the department uh still at the
 
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.670 align:start position:0%
with with the department uh still at the
table

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'd like to be able to ask you
 
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions as we walk through the earth
 
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.469 align:start position:0%
questions as we walk through the earth
amendment

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
and to see what you know about it and
 
00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 align:start position:0%
what you think the implications of the
 
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment are
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
there is a similar bill to this
 
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.469 align:start position:0%
there is a similar bill to this
in

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
the senate uh senate bill 422 fn
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
um i i might do something a little
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
unusual and and pass this out because
 
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a competing bill and so
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
i need to figure out and i i would
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
benefit from having input from division
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
three certainly
 
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.390 align:start position:0%
three certainly
uh

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start position:0%
uh
is

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 align:start position:0%
what to do about their bill and 103
 
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
whether they should be merged or what so
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a look at that
 
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.909 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a look at that
um

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
and so with that
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh we're ready for the department to
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
committee henry lipman the medicaid
 
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
director for the record
 
00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:57.759 align:start position:0%
good morning dr sarah finney medicaid
 
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i could
 
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
422 i don't know if the version you have
 
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.590 align:start position:0%
422 i don't know if the version you have
reflects

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
reflects
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment in committee um
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
where they
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to add some language um
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
to have the 1500 cap similar to
 
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.110 align:start position:0%
to have the 1500 cap similar to
what

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
i think uh representative erf's uh
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
um amendment i don't know if the
 
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
language is the same but that was a in
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
committee uh when they voted uh
 
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
at uh house i mean uh senate finance um
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think the odds are are good uh because
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
the version i have says as amended by
 
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
where would you like us to start
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
well i
 
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
sent dr finney
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
an email i don't know if you saw it
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
emphasizing that this is a
 
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
if you all could just walk through the
 
00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:08.629 align:start position:0%
if you all could just walk through the
bill

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
with an emphasis
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
on the financial inflows and outflows
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's what our primary concern
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
is i
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
we we have a division three has a deal
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
with hhs
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
um in the past we
 
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
the two committees
 
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh operated with a firewall between them
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
they did policy we did finance
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
and with the
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
agreement of chairman pearson
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
uh i i've i've encouraged them to think
 
00:07:41.589 --> 00:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
about the financial implications of any
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
policy bills that they're seeing and
 
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
then similarly he said you know we
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be funding bad policy
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
so uh so we have our primary lane of
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility which is
 
00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:54.469 align:start position:0%
responsibility which is
um

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
the financial part and that's where i'd
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
like you to focus but if we dabble in
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
policy along the way uh that's okay
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
representative would you mind if we
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
fielded your questions first and then
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
um went through a little bit further so
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
so it's your testimony
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
and you can do whatever you want you got
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
a micro hot mic and and uh what i gave
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
was just sort of
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
some uh
 
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
teasers to make sure that that that that
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
i had communicated the distinction
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
between us being a policy committee or a
 
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
finance committee and i just
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
that that was really the purpose of my
 
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.269 align:start position:0%
that that was really the purpose of my
email

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
very good i think just would emphasize
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
one of the the cost control measures
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
that i think you'll see
 
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
um that was reflected i think in the the
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
senate's uh finance committee amendment
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
and representative erf's
 
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment is that you know
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
structurally putting in a cap of 1500
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
and that if that were to
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
to change that that we would need to go
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
through a process of getting fiscal
 
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
approval and gnc approval i think you
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
know where we understand in terms of
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
where this
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
dental benefit has um
 
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
not got over the finish line has been
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
concerned over costs and and we want to
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
be um up front that we're we
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
we get that and we want to work with
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
the committee to make sure that you have
 
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:22.959 align:start position:0%
confidence in the and the cost component
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
the one of the factors that
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
was identified is you know how do we
 
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.350 align:start position:0%
was identified is you know how do we
um

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
you know in fact limit expenditures um
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh benefit would be limited to certain
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
groups and then again on medical
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
necessity i'll let
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
dr finney describe it further
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know one of the limiting factors was
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
to say that the denture benefit would be
 
00:09:59.670 --> 00:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
available for individuals in the
 
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
dd abd and cfi waivers and nursing
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
facility residents so that is one
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
self-limiting factor there
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay so could we avoid acronyms i'm
 
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.710 align:start position:0%
okay so could we avoid acronyms i'm
we're

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
not as familiar with it as you are and
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
plus we have the public listening okay
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
the developmentally disabled wave
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
choices for independent
 
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:33.269 align:start position:0%
choices for independent
living

00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
waivers

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then also nursing facility residents
 
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
would be um able to have the denture
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
and it that is also subject to medical
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
necessity so for instance if someone is
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
only missing one tooth they may or may
 
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
not really qualify for some type of
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
replacement if it is not
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
you know hampering their ability to chew
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
and function
 
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.550 align:start position:0%
and function
so

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know that's an important thing to
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand that there does have to be
 
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.550 align:start position:0%
understand that there does have to be
some

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
medical reason why the replacement is
 
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.509 align:start position:0%
medical reason why the replacement is
necessary

00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
are you
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
this i just am curious how granular
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh we've gotten uh do we know what the
 
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.790 align:start position:0%
uh we've gotten uh do we know what the
incremental

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
projected cost would be of just the uh
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
the denture part of this bill
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
by limiting it uh my recollection was
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
about a half a million dollar savings in
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the annual cost
 
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.790 align:start position:0%
terms of the annual cost
to

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
to this group okay so we we save it all
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
if we don't pass the bill i'm so i'm
 
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
curious what what the incremental cost
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
is is the incremental cost of the
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
dentures a half million a million a year
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
what do you have any numbers on that mr
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
lipman um if you give me a moment i'll
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
see if i can pull it
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
i just want to get that stuff into the
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
record and it will also vary with the
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
population you know
 
00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:07.910 align:start position:0%
population you know
um

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
so it is going to be an estimate based
 
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.310 align:start position:0%
so it is going to be an estimate based
on

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
you know the pool of individuals that
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
another point that we did want to make
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
um because sometimes there's um a
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
difference in what people
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
see as the adult benefit and the
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
children's benefit
 
00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
the children's benefit or the pediatric
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
benefit that we have always had here in
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire actually covers
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
individuals up until the day before they
 
00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079 align:start position:0%
turn 21.
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
so the individuals that we are talking
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
about for this adult benefit are 21 and
 
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.670 align:start position:0%
about for this adult benefit are 21 and
above

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
we need to be very careful when we look
 
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.550 align:start position:0%
we need to be very careful when we look
at

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers
 
00:12:58.399 --> 00:12:59.590 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers
that

00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
are are
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
given by the department that we divide
 
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
the population according to
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
those ages
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
um in in some instances folks think that
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
once a an individual turns 18 or 19 they
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
are then considered an adult and in some
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
ways they are but in terms of the dental
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
benefit that we have here in state
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
and another way that
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
the benefit is being limited is by the
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
cost sharing
 
00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:36.949 align:start position:0%
cost sharing
that

00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.069 align:start position:0%
that
was

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
put into play in this benefit
 
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.069 align:start position:0%
put into play in this benefit
and

00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
the specifics of that cost sharing are
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
that individuals who are over 100
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty level
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
would make a 10
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
co-pay based on the cost of the visit
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
and that amount that they pay annually
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
is capped at 5
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
of their annual income
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
and that that includes any type of
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
medical co-pay that they have it would
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
not just be from the dental benefit
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
so for example if an individual is also
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
having to make co-pays for pharmacy
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
costs that has to be brought into the
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
calculation of how they reach that five
 
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.269 align:start position:0%
calculation of how they reach that five
percent

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.069 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
do we currently have in-law the
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
co-pay for pharmaceuticals for medicaid
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
is that already in the law we do um it's
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
a de minimis one really it's a dollar or
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
two dollars per prescription um
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
currently so in terms of
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
absorbing a lot of the
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
the five percent of income is it's
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
unlikely to do so except someone who's
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
on a lot a lot of medicines
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
it's either a dollar or two dollars is
 
00:14:59.110 --> 00:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
the uh co-payment on prescriptions
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
and then for the dental visits it would
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
be 10
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
of whatever the the cost of the
 
00:15:07.509 --> 00:15:07.519 align:start position:0%
procedures are that day so so if it were
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
a 200 procedure they'd pay 20.
 
00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:12.399 align:start position:0%
and then could you just
 
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
talk us through um
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
who's who's going to do the collections
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
who's going to keep track of uh whether
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
the ceiling's been reached how how what
 
00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
are the mechanics of that
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
so um in testimony
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
i think earlier in the the process here
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's uncommon for
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
if it's done through the mcos if that's
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
approach is that they they're able to
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're able to do that if it was done
 
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
they're able to do that if it was done
through

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
a an entity like a delta dental which is
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
a sort of a freestanding
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
unit that both
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
parties had indicated that that
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
something coordination of benefits is is
 
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
not something that is uh
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
foreign to them and and would be able to
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
be done so in terms of tracking whether
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're up against the the limit um
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
there'd be obviously coordination
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
between the department and the
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
either the mcos or the dental mco
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
and in terms of collecting the actual
 
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.949 align:start position:0%
and in terms of collecting the actual
dollars

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
that would be at the
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
the provider level um that makes up
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
their payment so if they were entitled
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
a 200 payment the 20 would be collected
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
from um
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
from the patient
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
um and typically you know if you
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
people who have uh commercial insurance
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
that you know many of the practices
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
expect the co-payment before the service
 
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.749 align:start position:0%
expect the co-payment before the service
um

00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
and i would see that
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
it would work
 
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.829 align:start position:0%
it would work
somewhat

00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
similarly so
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
so somebody's going to have to receive
 
00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:54.550 align:start position:0%
so somebody's going to have to receive
their

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
financial information like their annual
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
income and all
 
00:16:58.959 --> 00:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
income and all
which

00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
opens up some privacy concerns can you
 
00:17:02.079 --> 00:17:02.870 align:start position:0%
opens up some privacy concerns can you
just

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
to talk a little bit about
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do to
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
respect privacy
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
of this financial information or or is
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
this a new issue or just something we've
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
already been dealing with in other areas
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's something we already deal with i
 
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
think is part of applying for medicaid
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have to make
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
financial disclosures to determine
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't necessarily be
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
disclosing someone's
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
income directly um
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
to anybody other than within the
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
department in terms of just accumulating
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
what would be a threshold would be what
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
would be going on behind the scenes
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
so so the receptionist that's going to
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
or the administrative assistant who's
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
going to receive the patient's money
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
at the point
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
at the point of care
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
how would that
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
administrative assistant know whether to
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
collect 15
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
or 22 dollars and 20 cents i mean if if
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 10 percent it's got to be
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
um that that sort of seems to want to be
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
calculated at the point of care
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
right um and so
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
you don't need the their income to
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
calculate whether the
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
what the 10 percent would equal to it it
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
would be that if you collected a a
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
copay in it
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
say that the 10 percent and it was
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
greater than
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
and it turned out that they had been
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
paying a lot of other things
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
then then there might they might either
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
look up in the system um
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
providers can go in the system and look
 
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
up a patient's situation or they may
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
potentially after the claim is processed
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
and adjudicated may need to make a
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
refund uh if they collected too much
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
similar to commercial insurance where
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
you have deductibles and co-pays that
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
and and and limits if you will on how
 
00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
much out-of-pocket cost someone has
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
all right have you
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
have you told us everything that you
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to tell us coming in here today
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
um i think we had some some more that we
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
to address and i'm i do have denture
 
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
information i just need i have a detail
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
level i just need to do a calculation
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
while sarah's telling you something else
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
i believe one of
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
one of the other questions
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
that you had was
 
00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
to specify what the federal share would
 
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.310 align:start position:0%
to specify what the federal share would
be

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
versus the state share
 
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.350 align:start position:0%
versus the state share
so

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
in general terms for this benefit the
 
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
standard medicaid
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
population is a 50 50 match so it's 50
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
federal 50 state funds
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
for the expansion population which is
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
granted advantage um it's a 90
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
federal share 10 percent state share
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
and that 10 percent comes from
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
the health
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund so it's it's not a general
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
just from a population standpoint our
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
assumption is there'd be 51
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
143 people who would be
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
having their coverage through on the 90
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
level and 37 085 people who would be at
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
the 50
 
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
the 50
level

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.669 align:start position:0%
 
at

00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
people who will be where the state would
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
be collecting the 90 percent match was
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
and where this where we would be
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
receiving the 50 match would be
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
37 085 individuals
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
would you remind me um
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
when and if
 
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.870 align:start position:0%
when and if
the

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
expanded medicaid sunsets when
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
when does that go away december of 23
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
unless there's an action by the
 
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
unless there's an action by the
legislature

00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then so based on this your
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill would that 51
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
000 or so just drop off of eligibility
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
if if there was not and a continuation
 
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
if if there was not and a continuation
yes

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
do you have more you're prepared to tell
 
00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:13.909 align:start position:0%
do you have more you're prepared to tell
us

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
i did want to share with you according
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
to the cost estimate for a full year of
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
coverage for the standard population the
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
cost to the state is 5.58 million
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
so that's 50
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then for uh the expansion population
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
is 1.32 million for a full year
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
now the way the bill is written there is
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
an implementation date of april 1st 2023
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
which means that there's one quarter
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
expense in fiscal year 23
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
for that quarter the state portion of
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the standard population would be 1.4
 
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
the standard population would be 1.4
million

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
and for the expansion population would
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
be 0.33 million
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
1.3 million for the expansion cost
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
estimate for the population was that 5
 
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.350 align:start position:0%
estimate for the population was that 5
million

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
5.58 for the standard if if you have
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
that in writing if you could hand it to
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i think pent up demand is one other
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
factor you wanted us to address but
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
the current funding of a medicaid
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
expansion grant advantage program
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
that the premium tax that's collected on
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
those policies because their commercial
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
policies the two percent tax that
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
applies to all policies in the state
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
that tax
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
grant advantage program is used to
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
offset the cost of the program
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
similarly it could be done in this
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
instance as well that the the tax would
 
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
amount to a little over 400 000 on when
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's fully implemented and it's paid
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
the taxes paid
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
the first tax payment that if you if we
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
were to
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
continue that practice would be um not
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
and so i think the other question you
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
had was related to pent-up demand and
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
the factor that
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh included in there and sarah you might
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
talk about that just a moment
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
um when the the pent-up demand was
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
calculated in this cost estimate um the
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
actuaries are basing that on a typical
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
medicaid population which is going to be
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
different than a commercial population
 
00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:05.029 align:start position:0%
different than a commercial population
so

00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
in the patient mix within the group of
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
individuals that's going to be insured
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
we know that this population is coming
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
into the benefit with heavy needs
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they haven't had the full
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
benefit prior to this
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
that is included in our calculation for
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
the cost estimate
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
as time moves on
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
that will be adjusted
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is that this is
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
written to be a value-based benefit and
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
part of value-based benefiting is
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
incentivizing for both you know provider
 
00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:43.830 align:start position:0%
incentivizing for both you know provider
and

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
and client
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
an improvement in oral health over the
 
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
time of the contract
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
that that part of the contract will
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
drive down the pent-up demand because
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to be made
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
responsible the vendor will be made
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure
 
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.870 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure
that

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
they meet certain requirements that we
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
set in the contracting
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
of the benefit
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that year over year more individuals
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
are coming in having the preventive care
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the restorative care that they need
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
and then maintained throughout the
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
course of the year they don't just drop
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.230 align:start position:0%
course of the year they don't just drop
out

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
that will help to bring down that
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand and will adjust the cost
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to tell is that going to take
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
one year two years three years four
 
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.590 align:start position:0%
one year two years three years four
years

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.510 align:start position:0%
years
um

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know obviously we want to see that
 
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand disappear as quickly as
 
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.110 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand disappear as quickly as
possible

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
you know that's i i can't do more than
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
estimate what that could be
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i think we've talked about this um
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
hallway conversation um
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
i i am
 
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
a believer that the pent-up demand isn't
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
quite as large as we might otherwise
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
anticipate because one of the mcos
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
providing 22
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the care has been providing a dental
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
benefit and they experienced some
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
adverse selection when they first made
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that dental benefit available so
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
i'm good with the conservative estimate
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
that you all have put together that's
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
the right way to go no surprises or good
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
surprises so but i i i just think our
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
actual experience we're not it's not
 
00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think that you're right in terms of
 
00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:53.990 align:start position:0%
i think that you're right in terms of
the

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
trying to be conservative about what it
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
could be so that we don't um
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
underfund the situation um
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh but also um you know since we don't
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
have experience you know having to rely
 
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.110 align:start position:0%
have experience you know having to rely
on

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
other states experience you know through
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
our actuary to develop that estimate
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
i did
 
00:27:16.549 --> 00:27:16.559 align:start position:0%
look at the detail on the the dentures
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the waiver populations
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the use rate is expected to be um
 
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.350 align:start position:0%
the the use rate is expected to be um
eight

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
individuals per thousand enrollees we
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the 37 000 enrollees
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
so it's uh eight
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
eight times 37 is the would be i'll give
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
you a number in a second representative
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
while um but just so you understand how
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm coming up with the number um it's
 
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
basically eight
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
exp expected eight times per thousand
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
people enrolled so we're talking about
 
00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:48.470 align:start position:0%
people enrolled so we're talking about
37

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
37
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
37
000

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
um individuals who fit that category
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
so in terms of what the the cost based
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
on the actuaries number would be about
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
175 000
 
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
for that population annually taking into
 
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.070 align:start position:0%
for that population annually taking into
account

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and taking into
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
again if you've got that written down
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere that helped the clerk make
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
sure we got that accurately
 
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
sure we got that accurately
so

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:22.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
i i'm assuming you've said everything
 
00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
that you intend to say today uh because
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like to open it up for uh questions
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
from other people just to make sure sure
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
that would that'd be great and i i guess
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
just would close with saying that uh i
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
think the range of amendments that we've
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
seen are all ones that we could work
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
to deliver a cost-effective benefit with
 
00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
cost controls
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
great i i want to i want to have
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative earth well wait a second
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
division three does anyone have any
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions about hb 103
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
you'd like to ask now
 
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
all right so representative erf do you
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
want to walk us through your amendment
 
00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh specifically what
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
do you see uh
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
so i'll be referring to
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
my amendment
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
what i refer to as the edwards amendment
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
which we also received and then hb103
 
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.029 align:start position:0%
which we also received and then hb103
itself

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
and i'll be describing the changes
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
between my amendment
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
and both the original bill as amended by
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
and the edwards amendment that we
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
received prior to the last
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
meeting the edwards amendment addressed
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
the changes that we agreed to at the
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
meeting prior to the last one many of
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
which were being discussed by uh mr
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
lipman and dr finney here today
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
so the first change
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
is improved wording
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
for which i owe thanks to mr ripple who
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
worked with me on on this
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
um so referring now to my amendment
 
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
these changes appear on page one
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
lines 21
 
00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.830 align:start position:0%
lines 21
to

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
27. and lines 31 to 32
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then page two in lines five and six
 
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.029 align:start position:0%
and then page two in lines five and six
so

00:30:15.029 --> 00:30:15.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
could you pause while we look at 21
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
through 27 since you highlighted those
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes and i'm actually going to address
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
each of those sections individually you
 
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
go for it i'll stop after that if you
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
want me to go for it
 
00:30:25.679 --> 00:30:26.389 align:start position:0%
want me to go for it
so

00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
now that dhhs is moving into a con into
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
the contracting phase
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
as the work group has put forth the
 
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.710 align:start position:0%
as the work group has put forth the
recommendations

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
the description was changed
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
to correspond to this phase of the
 
00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
to correspond to this phase of the
process

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
essentially the word model
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
was changed to contract or organization
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
as appropriate to reflect this is the
 
00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:50.559 align:start position:0%
contracting phase
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
with an organization
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
so this can be seen on page one
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
lines twenty one to twenty seven
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
what's referred to as section two the
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
first seven lines of section two
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
have been rewritten to make these
 
00:31:04.399 --> 00:31:05.990 align:start position:0%
have been rewritten to make these
changes

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
these correspond to page 1
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
lines 20 to 26 of the original bill as
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
amended by the house so i'll gladly stop
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
here if you'd like for a moment you want
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
to look at those um
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
if if you could just clarify
 
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
if if you could just clarify
what

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
with some precision
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
what do you think changed
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
um the word model yeah changed to
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
contract to organization essentially
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if you look at back at 103 the
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
original bill is amended it talks about
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
a model and so on and so forth we're
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
really not we're not in that mode
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
anymore we're talking about establishing
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
contracts with organizations so is it
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
fair to just consider that a semantic
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
cleanup i would say that's accurate and
 
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:55.990 align:start position:0%
cleanup i would say that's accurate and
if

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:31:59.110 --> 00:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
mr ripple wants to nod his head
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah since you wrote this
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
and the department doesn't have an issue
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
with that you've seen this you've
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
thought about it okay go ahead i don't
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
could you could you point the line
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
the word content will come in the next
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
there's some more lines that change with
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
regard to this change
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
so the change you see in the first three
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
lines there's relative to organizations
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
so the last two lines there section
 
00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.909 align:start position:0%
so the last two lines there section
three

00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
lines 31 and 32
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
similarly they were
 
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.509 align:start position:0%
similarly they were
rewritten

00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
rewritten
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
again just for clarity and to talk about
 
00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.990 align:start position:0%
again just for clarity and to talk about
organization

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
now the next line is where you'll see
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
contract pay i'm sorry the next page
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
line five and line six
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
so in line five
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
for the appropriate model it was deleted
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
and it simply says now capitalized rate
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
capitated rate excuse me for the
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
contract as was in the original and on
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
the next line where it said used to say
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
managed care model now says managed care
 
00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:23.990 align:start position:0%
managed care model now says managed care
organization

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
okay so the second change
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the edwards amendment
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
the amen that amendment replaced
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
and other services
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
as determined by the commissioner
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
with a reference to current dental
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
technology codes you may recal recall
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
this we had a pretty long discussion
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
with dr finney um about this
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
and when i dug a little deeper into that
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
with the help of dr finney and mr
 
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.029 align:start position:0%
with the help of dr finney and mr
lippman

00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
lippman
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
it turns out these codes are not
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
generally available to the public
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
as they're behind the paywall pretty
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
expensive baywall
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
on the web
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
dr finney agreed that the dhhs could
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
make the updates
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
uh to the relevant cdt codes available
 
00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
on dhhs
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
dhhs's website
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
and page 2 of my amendment
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
lines 26 to 27
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
reflect this you'll see the last
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
sentence there
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
says annual updates to the cdt and sorry
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
for the academies but that's as it is
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
shall be made available
 
00:34:43.109 --> 00:34:43.119 align:start position:0%
on the department of health and human
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
services website
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
may i ask the department question of
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
course okay so
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
what what do we think about
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that in the next 10 years
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
the cdt references will change and we're
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to and given that we're being so
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
precise in this bill does that mean that
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to come back and a
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
future legislature is going to have to
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
update the statute
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
no i think the only way there might be a
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
change is that in dentistry we may start
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
using diagnostic codes but that would be
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
in addition to the current dental
 
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
terminology the american dental
 
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
association owns that code set yeah and
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
the best way to describe every single
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
procedure that we're doing and i
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
personally would be shocked
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
if that ever changed that it because
 
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.069 align:start position:0%
if that ever changed that it because
it's

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the standard for describing procedures
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
and is used throughout the insurance you
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
know industry it's not just medicaid or
 
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.670 align:start position:0%
know industry it's not just medicaid or
commercial

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
everyone is using those codes okay
 
00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
do you want to go on
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
yes sir so the third change is on
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh page three
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
um at the top
 
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
and this is referring to my amendment
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh lines one
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
two three
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
a new section five
 
00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
is added to the list of dental services
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
dental services being the section we're
 
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
dental services being the section we're
in

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying that the annual
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
individual the individual annual benefit
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
is capped at fifteen hundred dollars per
 
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.069 align:start position:0%
is capped at fifteen hundred dollars per
year

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
with an allowance for adjustment with
 
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:31.670 align:start position:0%
with an allowance for adjustment with
approval

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal committee and governor and
 
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.190 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal committee and governor and
council

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
this fifteen hundred dollar per year cap
 
00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.829 align:start position:0%
this fifteen hundred dollar per year cap
is

00:36:38.829 --> 00:36:38.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
exclusive of preventive services
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
and this cap is already incorporated in
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
the plan developed by dhhs
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
and i'll pause here mr chairman if you'd
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay the fourth change
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh is i'm going to describe as follows
 
00:37:21.109 --> 00:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
so given that this new medicaid
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
given that this is a new medicaid
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
benefit this entire process here
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
it seemed reasonable to incorporate all
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
relevant parts of the benefit
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
into a single place
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
so there's no need to refer back to
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
previous chapter law in the future
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
remember the future maybe 10 years 20
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
years from now
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
to this end
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
the work group language of the current
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
chapter law is repealed
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
and reenacted
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
in a new section 4
 
00:37:53.910 --> 00:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
on page 3
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
lines 24 23
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
to 37
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
and then continuing on page 4
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
lines one
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
then go ahead and
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
this is a section that you've you've
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
worked with mr ripple and we've
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
validated that this uh comports to what
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
we need to do to clean up the statutes
 
00:38:29.589 --> 00:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
so as mr ripple extracted this from the
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
chapter law
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
and put it in here and again he cannot
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.589 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:40.630 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
so the final
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
uh change
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
also on page four line seven to nine
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
is a new roman excuse me roman numeral
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
three subsection
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
which sunsets the work group when their
 
00:38:59.109 --> 00:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
work is complete
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
based on the selection of an approach
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
for administering the medicaid dental
 
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.310 align:start position:0%
for administering the medicaid dental
benefit

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that concludes my
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
statement of the changes
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'm i i'm i'm probably
 
00:39:17.349 --> 00:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
confusing myself with the effective date
 
00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.230 align:start position:0%
confusing myself with the effective date
on

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
page 4
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 14.
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh i'm i was expecting to see
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
april 1
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
2023 written in here somewhere and mr
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
2023 written in here somewhere and mr
lipman

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
lipman
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
you may remember that i think they were
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
the work that we have to do to get the
 
00:39:37.589 --> 00:39:37.599 align:start position:0%
state plan in effect
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
not the the actual effective date of the
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
the benefit was where that was
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made in the last work
 
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
group session we had with you
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
it ready by one april yes okay but is do
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%

it's listed somewhere described
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere is maybe one of the key
 
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
a sponsor around
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
these changes and
 
00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200 align:start position:0%
how the sponsor and how the health and
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i remember when
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
we put an appropriation in last year for
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
a dental benefit and you got up on the
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
floor and said that it wasn't vetted
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
properly or adequately now we've really
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
vetted this um
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
tremendously so i think um we've
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
examined this in ways that we hadn't
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
examined it that at that point um
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to thank um representative
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
erf for a lot of clarifying language um
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
especially the 15 putting the 1500 cap
 
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:40.790 align:start position:0%
especially the 15 putting the 1500 cap
in

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
which is what the
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
actuarial estimates were based on and so
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
looking back i it's hard to believe that
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
we didn't put that in
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
earlier because that is a
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
significant part of describing the
 
00:42:58.630 --> 00:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
benefit so i thank you for that my my
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
one question
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i think this is just um
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
wondering about the intent
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
change on the top of page three
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
i wanted to change that cap
 
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
or are we are we
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
inviting them to kind of renegotiate the
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.069 align:start position:0%
whole thing
um

00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
should it go before those committees
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
can i respond
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the intent and this was
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
discussion with dr finney and um mr
 
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.430 align:start position:0%
discussion with dr finney and um mr
lipman

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
lipman
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
that this is a benefit that's
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
obviously well i imagine in perpetuity
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that that 500 cap over the years
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
decades will need to be increased
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
more likely than not and rather than
 
00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:01.270 align:start position:0%
more likely than not and rather than
restricting

00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:01.280 align:start position:0%
restricting
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh the state to have to come back and
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
get new legislation
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
this was decided as the most efficient
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
way to allow them to come
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
and get that cap
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
adjusted rather than having going back
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and rewriting the law
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak and yet still providing some
 
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
so to speak and yet still providing some
control

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
over the changes over time
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i would defer to them to speak
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
directly to that if
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
that would help
 
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.670 align:start position:0%
that would help
well

00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um that seems to make perfect
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
sense to me and um
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm really in agreement with all the
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made i think they
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
did not change the substance
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
substantively the benefit in any way and
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
i think in many ways they make
 
00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
improvements in clarifying things
 
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
and based on your work uh with
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
hhs um
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
are you comfortable saying whether or
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
not you think the policy committee would
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think they would be absolutely fine
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
with it all right
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
does that address your questions
 
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you mr chair yes um i also
 
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
did speak with the chairman of hhs and
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
did go over the benefit with him as well
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
at the amendment with him okay well
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
so so the other
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
i i i would have felt comfortable
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
getting division three uh sort of on the
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.069 align:start position:0%
getting division three uh sort of on the
record

00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:27.109 align:start position:0%
record
today

00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
on what the house has done
 
00:45:30.079 --> 00:45:30.870 align:start position:0%
on what the house has done
um

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
but i i have to tell you that uh i just
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
today became aware uh for the first time
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
of senate bill 422 fn
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
and um i'm i'm told that this is
 
00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
extremely similar
 
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
to what we've done but they've got a
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
different funding source other than
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and because i've not read this uh i i'm
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
i i could you give us
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
your view on what sb 422 does that this
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
um

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
has the same 1500
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
cap where it would differ is they do not
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
limit the denture benefit
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they do not include
 
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
the cost sharing um that's included in
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
in representative earth's amendment or
 
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.950 align:start position:0%
in representative earth's amendment or
um

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
other amendments that the committee has
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
considered those i think would be the
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
key differences um in terms of the the
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
range of benefits other than than
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
denture i think they line up pretty it's
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
the same the same
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
it was again
 
00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:41.190 align:start position:0%
it was again
changes

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
so the the the differences would be
 
00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.510 align:start position:0%
so the the the differences would be
that

00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.790 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's there's no limitation on on
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
denture to a specific population
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
the the similarity is that they both
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
have the fifth to be solidified on what
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
the what the cost uh of coverage would
 
00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.309 align:start position:0%
the what the cost uh of coverage would
be

00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
all right so um we we did put this on um
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
hb 103 on the on the calendar for us to
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
discuss on the first of march
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
i i think we've go
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead just one other point in terms
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
of what the difference in the cost
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
estimate um so the the state share under
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
um representative erf and and hp 103 has
 
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.470 align:start position:0%
um representative erf and and hp 103 has
been

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
6.91 million on an annual basis the the
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
if i'm remembering correctly it's 7.45
 
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:41.349 align:start position:0%
if i'm remembering correctly it's 7.45
million

00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
again if you have those written down
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
it'd be great for us to see the
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
difference between the senate and house
 
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
difference between the senate and house
estimates

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.549 align:start position:0%
estimates
um

00:47:56.549 --> 00:47:56.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
did you get them
 
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.630 align:start position:0%
did you get them
4.175

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
4.175
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
mr ripple did you did you want to make a
 
00:48:05.359 --> 00:48:06.790 align:start position:0%
mr ripple did you did you want to make a
comment

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
he whispered in my ear one other point i
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
should have made is the the financing
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
mechanism um
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
contemplates using the uh settlement
 
00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
right proceeds from um centene
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
settlement that the state had uh
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
minus the
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
an amount that's necessary to sort of
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
complete the
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
a portion of the
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
um what was the damages in terms of
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
paying back to the federal government
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
their share so it's about roughly around
 
00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
18 million of the 21 million or 18 and a
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
half million the 21 million would be
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
used to help fund the dental benefit
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
with that i i think
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
what i'd like to do and this is uh this
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
is open to some discussion
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm favorably leaning towards
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
accepting the irf amendment
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
and of course we're going to vote on all
 
00:49:09.829 --> 00:49:09.839 align:start position:0%
this and discuss it but but i'm just
 
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
letting you know where i'm at i i i'm
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm favorable towards the irf amendment
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
i on the on the senate bill
 
00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
starting at line 32 and i'll be giving
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
this to you there's a section on the
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
settlement fund that was just referenced
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
so what i would do left to my own
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
devices i think is to take 103
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
and append into it another amendment
 
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
maybe amend the irf amendment i don't i
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
don't know how to do this mr ripple can
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
help us with this um
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
is is to take
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
the settlement language and include it
 
00:49:54.549 --> 00:49:54.559 align:start position:0%
in hb 103
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
i i would
 
00:49:56.839 --> 00:49:58.390 align:start position:0%
i i would
i

00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
am very much opposed to expanding the
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
benefit beyond what 103 has done i think
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of time on it
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
more time than the senate probably has
 
00:50:08.319 --> 00:50:09.270 align:start position:0%
more time than the senate probably has
um

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
so so i i like the sculpting of sorry
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's my housekeeper that she's important
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
but not that important
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
i just lost my train of thought though
 
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.790 align:start position:0%
i just lost my train of thought though
so

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i want to i i think i want to keep
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
103 as the shell
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
i i like the irf amendment and i want to
 
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
take the settlement money and and put
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
that into 103
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's what i'd like to
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
take to the finance committee for
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
acceptance and i think we can do that
 
00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:45.510 align:start position:0%
acceptance and i think we can do that
in

00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
something like an executive session of
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
division three
 
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the first of
 
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.750 align:start position:0%
on the first of
march

00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and with your help mr ripple of
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
course um
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
so that's where i'm coming from what
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
representative weiler says he concurs
 
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think representative that
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me as well yes okay
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative bean i see you shaking
 
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:16.240 align:start position:0%
your head uh representative long do you
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
have an opinion on this i know that
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
you're sitting in today for
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner i'm good i
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
think it sounds okay you're good with
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
that that approach okay
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and so representative rogers you're
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay with that
 
00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.069 align:start position:0%
okay with that
okay

00:51:30.069 --> 00:51:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
so and there's no reason or is there a
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
reason for the department to disagree
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
with this approach
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
no there's not okay representative
 
00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
no there's not okay representative
shapiro

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
shapiro
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
i don't really understand the
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
implications of where the funding comes
 
00:51:46.549 --> 00:51:46.559 align:start position:0%
from but it's um if the department
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
thinks that that's
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
a good result that's fine with me i i
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
think it actually helps um the
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
likelihood of passing the bill because
 
00:51:58.549 --> 00:51:58.559 align:start position:0%
there's an identified source of funds uh
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
so that we're not
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking it out of general funds in the
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
near term so we've got a two three four
 
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.790 align:start position:0%
near term so we've got a two three four
year

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
run rate that is supported
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
i would definitely support it yeah
 
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
any final words of wisdom for us
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
just appreciation and thanks for working
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
with us okay all right and um
 
00:52:25.589 --> 00:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
with that uh i'm going to close today's
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on hb 103
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
um and we will reconvene on it on the
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
first of march we're going to bring in a
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
another amendment that respects
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative irf
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
and respects the senate's source of
 
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.069 align:start position:0%
and respects the senate's source of
funding

00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:52:42.079 --> 00:52:43.349 align:start position:0%
funding
so

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:45.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:52:46.559 --> 00:52:47.349 align:start position:0%
all right
uh

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
mr ripple i think on the calendar i did
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
i put um that we would start
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
with 1677 at 11 a.m
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
i i may have done that or did i just
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
sequence them
 
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.870 align:start position:0%
sequence them
okay

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:05.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
yeah so let's um let's go ahead and take
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
a five-minute recess the attorney
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
general and and attorney ramsey are in
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
the hallway i think and and then we'll
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
start with uh
 
00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.470 align:start position:0%
start with uh
mr

00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
mr
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
i i i've been told that if i try to
 
00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:27.680 align:start position:0%
sound italian
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
i might be able to pull it off but
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
it being well after the five minute
 
01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
it being well after the five minute
recess

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
recess
 
01:09:06.550 --> 01:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and open the
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
and consistent with the the promised
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
last hearing we're going to hear
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%

advocates today
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
and i i think we have two that want to
 
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:27.430 align:start position:0%
and i i think we have two that want to
speak

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:27.440 align:start position:0%

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
to be able to hear from that person
 
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:04.630 align:start position:0%
to be able to hear from that person
today

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
what mr early is doing yes yeah
 
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:10.159 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
since we don't have to operate one as a
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee i i i would like that to be a
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
succinct training session for us so that
 
01:10:25.270 --> 01:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
we get the highlights um
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chairman yes uh
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
could you ask the ag to hand out the
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
amended version
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that we would you like to do that now
 
01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay that way
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
all right and so
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
so since i'm asking you to do some work
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
also if you'd like to use the table as
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
you're writing your notes you're welcome
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
to find a seat
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
oh i don't think i think i was supposed
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
to hand these out
 
01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh the the the one that was sent out
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
last night was not numbered
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
you know the the sides weren't numbered
 
01:11:51.990 --> 01:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay while we're passing that out i'll
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
do some administrative notes for the
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
clerk and for the public
 
01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.149 align:start position:0%
clerk and for the public
um

01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
we we had asked for a written testimony
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think we got that from you and we've
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
got some written testimony also from
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
mr early
 
01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:19.910 align:start position:0%
mr early
and

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
so the clerk will lean heavily on those
 
01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.229 align:start position:0%
so the clerk will lean heavily on those
uh

01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
if if you would
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
if you would just take any sort of um
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
supplemental notes so we can keep track
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
of what documents we received
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
and and then when the attorney general
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
starts walking us through the change
 
01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
document um we'll go in sequence like we
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
did last time and rather than having you
 
01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
did last time and rather than having you
record

01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr clerk all the all the things being
 
01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.870 align:start position:0%
uh mr clerk all the all the things being
said

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
if you'll just sort of
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
time stamp when we're talking about
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
particular things so that the public can
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
use it as a table of contents or a
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
reference so they can actually listen
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
quickly to the part of the testimony
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
they want to hear
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
is that do you understand because that's
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
all right so it seems like the wrestling
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
is done and so
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
there we go okay thank you
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%

i'm going to still try to keep it brief
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
and to the point
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
i want to preface it by saying i i only
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
received the
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
latest draft from the ag's office late
 
01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.229 align:start position:0%

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
um and i
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
jim hadem and i my partner worked late
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
putting together this summary of
 
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.910 align:start position:0%
putting together this summary of
testimony

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
um but i read it again this morning and
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
i realized you know i have more to say
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
and i i i'm gonna ask you if i can have
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
an opportunity in the next day or two to
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
amend this or edit it or put it in
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
another form so
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
uh there may be a few things that i want
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
to add to it
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
i i think that's fine let let me go over
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
the timeline to make sure i'm i'm clear
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
with my chairman okay uh madam chair
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
what i think
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're asked to do division three in
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
division one
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
is to try to
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
exit from this committee with a
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation a document
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
give a recommendation on so that the
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
full finance committee can get it
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
shortly after the 1st of march and then
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
we're ready as a full committee to vote
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
on it is that the timeline
 
01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
on it is that the timeline
and

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
i guess we might also say that we've got
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
another hearing on our work session on
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
right i i've got that we we're going to
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
meet again on the first of march but if
 
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.709 align:start position:0%
meet again on the first of march but if
our

01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
expectation of the deliverable that day
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
is a vote on a final document as a
 
01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.990 align:start position:0%
is a vote on a final document as a
subcommittee

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
01:15:16.550 --> 01:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
i i'm just thinking that we need to send
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
the full finance committee
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
a document with our recommendation
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh yes you do but it probably won't
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
occur on the first
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
i i truly hope we can try to do that
 
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
just to keep from log jamming but but
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your flexibility i
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
understand we have a snowstorm coming
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow but nonetheless we'll be
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
talking by phone my partners and i and
 
01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:44.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things we've not been able to
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
do is talk to since last night talk to
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
any of our clients and that's uh we we
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
can only talk to
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
a few of them not not 500 so i don't
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
think i answered your question and your
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
question was do you have some
 
01:15:59.030 --> 01:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental time to
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
revise and extend your remarks and then
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
and you do
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
okay i i would just ask you that you
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
continue to work with the ag's office so
 
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.189 align:start position:0%

01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
they know what's going on because
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're helping us prepare the document
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to talk about on one
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%

the three central and essential points
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
that were
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
we considered necessary to a
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
victim-friendly resolution of all this

litigation
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
and the first was
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
that it include
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
all the victims not just a subset and we
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to discriminate against
 
01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.830 align:start position:0%
don't want to discriminate against
victims

01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
based on the type of harm rather than
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
just the fact that they were harmed
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's one the other is the independence
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
of the administrator
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the third was that we asked that
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
victims not be required to as a price of
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
admission to the process
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
be required to waive or give up their
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
judicial rights
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that we've made
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
significant progress on two of those
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
in the latest draft um the the first is
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
that i'll uh addressed is is the issue
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
right i'm actually not going to address
 
01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the issue of uh moving
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the selection of the r of the
 
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.189 align:start position:0%
the selection of the r of the
administrator

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:34.580 align:start position:0%
from john formella from the ag
 
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.070 align:start position:0%
from john formella from the ag
[Music]

01:17:36.070 --> 01:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
and being selected
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
by the judiciary by the supreme court i
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
have to admit it's not something i ever
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
had thought of
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh when i saw it last night i said well
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's not the ag that is progress
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh for our clients and maybe that will
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
be more palatable to them
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
but i it's still too new and i really
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
haven't thought through the consequences
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
and the uh the ramifications i mean a
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.630 --> 01:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
by making it a full-time judicial
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
employee i'm wondering if we aren't
 
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
limiting the pool
 
01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
of talent uh from which we can draw i
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
mean i would view the the pool of talent
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
to be people who are actively doing
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
mediations for a living and arbitrations
 
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
for a living and are very good at it and
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
have done things that are similar to
 
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.630 align:start position:0%
have done things that are similar to
this

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they're willing to if
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
they're willing or would be required to
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
give up that practice in order to take
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
this job i don't know maybe
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
we have part-time circuit judges maybe
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
you could maintain your mediation
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
practice over here and still go to work
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the state i don't know if it's
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
possible but that that'll be something
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
that i'll note in my comments in the
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
next few days
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
the other is that um
 
01:18:47.189 --> 01:18:47.199 align:start position:0%
i have to talk we have to talk to our
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
clients i mean our clients uh
 
01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.070 align:start position:0%
clients i mean our clients uh
uh

01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
the measure of success for this program
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
or this process is going to be on how
 
01:18:58.630 --> 01:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
many of the 500
 
01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
actually use it
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
and i've talked to you several times
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
about the the level of trust which is
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
actually very low
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
among our clients they view the state as
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
their their their abuser
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state is having harmed them not help
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
them and oftentimes that harm begin with
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
a judge
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
usually at the circuit court at the
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
family court level
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh you know a kid who may be
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
being abused at home next thing you know
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
he's acting out at school smoking
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and then he's skipping school
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
and he and his stepfather's only
 
01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
apparent approach to parenting is
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
beating him so he's being beaten but
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
he's not telling anybody that and next
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
thing you know he he's skipping school
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
again and he's scoring weed and then he
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
goes back to the judge and the judge
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
puts him in ydc meanwhile the judge
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
knows nothing about the abuse at home he
 
01:19:44.149 --> 01:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
knows nothing about all the other
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
problems the kid has
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the kids sitting there at 14 or 15
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
thinking boy
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
the judge has wrecked my life i'm
 
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
separated from my family and i'm in this
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
terrible place so a lot of our folks are
 
01:19:57.270 --> 01:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know they hear about the judiciary
 
01:19:58.870 --> 01:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's their experience
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
i for me
 
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
gord mcdonald i have tremendous respect
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
for gordon as the chief judge i've
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned that before he's my partner
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
for 17 years
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
a person of great integrity
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
i would trust gordon myself but it's up
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
to our clients to make that call and
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
i need more time to really think it
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
through and opine on it i will in the
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
next few days all right i appreciate
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
where you are in your thought process
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
and your communication process i i we
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
just need real clarity uh because we've
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
gone through two scenarios we've gone
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
through maybe three scenarios of how
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to appoint this
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
administrator ins and and so far
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
you've you've had concerns about all
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
three uh of the methods so
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
we we need you to know what we we i
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
would like to know what you're for
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know what you what you want us to do
 
01:20:49.199 --> 01:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
you know what you what you want us to do
um

01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and we don't have to do that today
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
because you said you need to think about
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
it i do okay so think about it but but
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
we're just going to need clarity if yes
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
i'll try i'll do it as give you as much
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
clarity as i can all right i just can't
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
today on the fund administrator it's too
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
new right okay um i do have much more
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
clear ideas on the first point though
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
which is the scope
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh initial the initial draft said only
 
01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
only victims of sexual assault and
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
now this draft is embroiding that to
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
victims of physical assault as well as
 
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
victims of physical assault as well as
sexual

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
sexual
 
01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.430 align:start position:0%
sexual
um

01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
and uh what our
 
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
what we propose in instead is really the
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
abu the definition of child abuse that
 
01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf uses in its manual
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
broader than physical and sexual abuse
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
but also includes emotional abuse
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
unlawful usually in the form of unlawful
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
confinement solitary for weeks or months
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
at a time of a 15 year old
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
so that's what we we propose i think
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
it's progress but i would really like we
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
really want the solitary confinement
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
piece to be included
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
i have submitted to the committee
 
01:21:58.629 --> 01:21:58.639 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
studies and and uh expert opinions about
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
the harm to a child of this form of
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
emotional abuse
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh is probably the most significant harm
 
01:22:10.390 --> 01:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
it may be counterintuitive but the
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
experts tell us that is true and that if
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
you put a kid in solitary for two three
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
weeks two three months
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
that does more harm to them than an
 
01:22:20.629 --> 01:22:20.639 align:start position:0%
actual beating and it does more harm
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
than the sexual abuse that's what the
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
experts tell us i don't think it should
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
be excluded and so that that would be
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
our pitch on that one and i've i've uh
 
01:22:31.750 --> 01:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
provided uh uh some annotation here for
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
a summary of our argument
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh we don't want to discriminate against
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative berger
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
in your discussions with your clients
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea as to
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
how many were put in solitary
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
confinement at ydc
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
and for how long
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes we do have some idea i can't put a
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
number on it but i will tell you the
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
number is very very high of kids who are
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
put into solitary confinement
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
it the numbers when we're talking
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
weeks and months
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
at a time those numbers are obviously
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
smaller but they are still very
 
01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.430 align:start position:0%
smaller but they are still very
significant

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
view it as something where
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
kind of like a lot of you know some
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
parents who are tired they put their
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
kids in front of the tv i think at times
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the way you handled a kid who was acting
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
out or was oppositional had trauma and
 
01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.270 align:start position:0%
out or was oppositional had trauma and
problems

01:23:33.270 --> 01:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
lock them in a cell and they i think
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
that was a form of babysitting
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
and uh and it did tremendous harm to a
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
lot of these kids thank you i will add
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
though that i only i do not think that
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
the number of kids who only suffered
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement i don't think that
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
number is large it's almost always
 
01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
accompanied by physical or sexual abuse
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
so the number is not great that are that
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
only sovereign solitary so we're not
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
talking about a large number being
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
excluded here the way the bill is
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
written but i don't exclude anybody i
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to give up on those folks
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think the i don't think
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
the state should either i think
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
states should recognize that that is a
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
very substantial and significant form of
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
harm and a form of negligence on the
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
part of the people that ran the ydc
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
and it should be recognized they
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be it doesn't mean their
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuits aren't going away anyway so
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
states gonna still have to deal with it
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
it's just that why not deal it in this
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
expedited uh and controlled and and uh
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
more victim-friendly process
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
do you think did you have a follow-up no
 
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.629 align:start position:0%
do you think did you have a follow-up no
um

01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
do you think you can provide input on
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
the definition that you would like to
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
see included so that the solitary
 
01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
confinement it's in our it's in our
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
notes okay and then because i've i've
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
i've not read through all of this i just
 
01:24:55.669 --> 01:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask you
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
if um if you if there's a
 
01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
distinction that is made in the
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
definition between solitary confinement
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
for an hour
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
for a day
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
for a week
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know i would think that there's kind
 
01:25:12.790 --> 01:25:12.800 align:start position:0%
of an exponential curve yes to the
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
damage being done based on the amount of
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
time so so is that
 
01:25:20.709 --> 01:25:20.719 align:start position:0%
that well that sensitivity to the amount
 
01:25:22.709 --> 01:25:22.719 align:start position:0%
of i don't i don't think that this bill
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
can get to that level of granularity i
 
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
just don't i think that's for the
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines process that the bill
 
01:25:28.239 --> 01:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
guidelines process that the bill
proposes

01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
proposes
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
and that that is i think going to
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
require some deference
 
01:25:35.030 --> 01:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
to the ag and to the claimant's
 
01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys and to the administrator to
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
figure out those terms the the people
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
who are expert in this and do it a lot i
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
for instance now uh ydc's current rules
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
only since 2020
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
say that you can't put a kid in for more
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
than 15 minutes into solitary 15 minutes
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
now i'm not even talking hours i'm
 
01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.470 align:start position:0%
now i'm not even talking hours i'm
talking

01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
days and then weeks and then months and
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
i but that's something that can be baked
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
into those guidelines
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh when we actually get in the room and
 
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.830 align:start position:0%
uh when we actually get in the room and
say

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
what what do we understand to be a
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
inappropriate i mean there are times of
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
course i think they're rare when it's
 
01:26:11.590 --> 01:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
when it might be necessary for the
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
security of the child or the security of
 
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
the institution you know of other kids
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's possible i'm not discounting that
 
01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
possibility but that's not what we're
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
talking here we're talking about it
 
01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:22.470 align:start position:0%
talking here we're talking about it
being

01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
almost ubiquitous and routine and done
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
for punishment or just convenience of
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
or a way of breaking their will
 
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:32.149 align:start position:0%
or a way of breaking their will
and

01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
my view that is not a humane way to
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
treat a child you don't break a child's
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
will by locking them up for a month at a
 
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
time in their underwear
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
just don't do that representative emmer
 
01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
are we dealing with records with this or
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
are we dealing with testimony i mean do
 
01:26:52.310 --> 01:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
we have records that go back to show
 
01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.189 align:start position:0%
we have records that go back to show
that

01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
the period of time somebody was in
 
01:26:56.950 --> 01:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement
 
01:26:58.550 --> 01:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
i have not seen
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
the state's records because they haven't
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
shared them with us and as far as i
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
understand jen
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
ramsey who is managing the civil side
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
may not have seen them either because
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
they are possibly tied up in the
 
01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.430 align:start position:0%
they are possibly tied up in the
criminal

01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
investigation and there's a separation
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
between the criminal and the civil but
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
what i do have is
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of our clients records
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
which are from ydc and of course i have
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
my clients testimony
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
and they're you know they're telling me
 
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
and i you know at a certain level of
 
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
and i you know at a certain level of
consistency

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
between these folks who don't know each
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
other but are saying this is the same
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
they all it sounds very similar you know
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
over time you know that that this
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
practice existed
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that there was it was it was a way
 
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.270 align:start position:0%
and that there was it was it was a way
of

01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
managing the facility
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
without really caring for the kids
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
and locking them up and and
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
making them
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
go to the bathroom in their cells
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
because there's no toilets in the cells
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
you know and not let them out to go the
 
01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
bathroom and the stories are horrific
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
and these are people that don't know
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
each other and they all
 
01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
sing what ends up being kind of common
 
01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.470 align:start position:0%
sing what ends up being kind of common
themes

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
themes
 
01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:04.639 align:start position:0%
so i i have access to all the witnesses
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
which the state doesn't
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
um i don't know exactly how
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive or granular the records
 
01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
kept by ydc were because we haven't been
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been given access to
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
them yet
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
do you want do you want to go on with
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
your eyes yes um
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
i'm still on page one of my summary and
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at looking at page four line
 
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.030 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at looking at page four line
three

01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
three
um

01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
just again this is just from last night
 
01:28:34.149 --> 01:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
the state is now talking about the
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of including physical abuse
 
01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.430 align:start position:0%
possibility of including physical abuse
but

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh it clai says that the
 
01:28:40.159 --> 01:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh it clai says that the
as

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
interposed a a cap of 150 000 on any
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
case of physical abuse
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
as far as i know that number was pulled
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
from the ether and it's not tethered to
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
anything real
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think the state actually knows
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
what the damages are yet i don't think
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
the state actually the state hasn't
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
heard from the witnesses yet the state
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't really know what happened so i
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't know how
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
it could be anything other than
 
01:29:08.310 --> 01:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary to pick a number like 150 000.
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know you you received my letter
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
yesterday there may well be claims that
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
are worth less than 150 000 or 150 000
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
but there's also plenty that are worth
 
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
more than that and i don't know why what
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
person would participate if they felt
 
01:29:21.199 --> 01:29:21.910 align:start position:0%
person would participate if they felt
that

01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
the process is going to lowball them you
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
know on something that is worth more
 
01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.110 align:start position:0%
know on something that is worth more
um

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
are you recommending the state go
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
without a ceiling
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
well the the ceilings or do you have a
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
different arbitrary number just to pick
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
no i don't have an arbitrary number but
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
a different number the number we propose
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
is the one the legislature has already
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
enacted there's two numbers one is for
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
individual events
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
and uh the other is for aggregate in
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
individual events and
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
um if i remember correctly i think the
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
statutory number is 325
 
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
per in per incidence maximum of course
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
it could be zero too but the max i think
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
is 325
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
and the uh aggregate total for an
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
individual say somebody has been beaten
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
15 times
 
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:09.590 align:start position:0%
15 times
or

01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
put in solitary for a year or whatever
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the aggregate is actually defined at rsa
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
14 colon 35b it's actually a formula so
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
i can't give you a specific number
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
because it very tends to vary every year
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
but it's it's tethered to
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh the general fund revenues
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
it's a tiny percentage of those revenues
 
01:30:29.199 --> 01:30:29.910 align:start position:0%
it's a tiny percentage of those revenues
but

01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
it is uh
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
it provides a ready-made cap that the
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislature has already approved
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
for aggregate per-individual
 
01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.790 align:start position:0%
for aggregate per-individual
cases

01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know why we
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
why would we differ from what the
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislature has already made law i think
 
01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's really what the cap ought to be
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i think you've raised a good
 
01:30:51.990 --> 01:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
point okay
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
do you do you have another good point
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
i hope so
 
01:30:56.159 --> 01:30:57.430 align:start position:0%
i hope so
um

01:30:57.430 --> 01:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
i i again i can't i have to tell of all
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the things that we
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
are most concerned about it is including
 
01:31:05.990 --> 01:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
the broadening the scope so all the
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
victims are included that's the most
 
01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
important thing i've mentioned the
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
independence of the administrator and
 
01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.229 align:start position:0%
independence of the administrator and
the

01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh interesting idea of of reposing it
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
with the the the responsibility of the
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
i i admit i had never thought of that
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
before and i'm going to have to think
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
about it for a few more days and i'll
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that
 
01:31:24.960 --> 01:31:26.310 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that
um

01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
so to append to that though if if you
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
think about it and you don't like that
 
01:31:30.239 --> 01:31:31.350 align:start position:0%
think about it and you don't like that
idea

01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
idea
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
i i would just ask you to come up with
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
something with a specific idea i will
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i was i'm on page three of my summary
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
but i think i've already covered it
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
which is the issue of the caps i don't
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
think these arbitrary
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
numbers make sense i've already said why
 
01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:48.470 align:start position:0%
numbers make sense i've already said why
not

01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
just go with what the legislature has
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
already made law
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's what would apply in the court why
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
why should it apply any differently here
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
i just don't see the reason um i'm on
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
page four of my summary
 
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:01.990 align:start position:0%
page four of my summary
um

01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is our third major concern and that
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.149 align:start position:0%
is that
um

01:32:08.149 --> 01:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
that a victim who chooses to
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
wants to bypass the judicial remedy and
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
and or once it wants to at least submit
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
a claim and try to settle the case
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
um without having to go through the full
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
gamut of judicial
 
01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.750 align:start position:0%
gamut of judicial
process

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
why should they have to as a price of
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
admission give up their judicial claim
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
we don't want to force victims to do
 
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
that at the
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
now this this this issue could be
 
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.110 align:start position:0%
now this this this issue could be
influenced

01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
influenced
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
depending on whether there is sufficient
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
level of trust in the administrator
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
we don't have that yet
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
and a sufficient level in the guidelines
 
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:45.910 align:start position:0%
and a sufficient level in the guidelines
that

01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
will be developed we don't have that yet
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
and if if there are no arbitrary caps we
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
don't have that yet either but if all
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
those things fell into place maybe i
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
could recommend and persuade my clients
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's worth the risk to you
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
because you're pretty certain we have a
 
01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
pretty good idea of what the range is
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
where you're going to fall
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
and when you go to the army with the
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
administrator we have a pretty good idea
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
because the guidelines tell us and we
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
trust the administrator and we're
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
confident in his his or her
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
independence and there are no arbitrary
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
caps or the only arbitrary gaps are what
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature's already
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh allowed and those are those would be
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
sufficient for your purposes in this
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
process at that point we might be able
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
to say sure it's it's it's worth the
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
risk of giving up your judicial your
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
only leverage and entering the process
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
but there that's a lot of conditions
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
that we have we don't have yet
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh but right now uh it it's too risky i
 
01:33:46.070 --> 01:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't advise them to do it because it
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
could be a trap they end up in the
 
01:33:52.709 --> 01:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
the uh process and the ag
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
makes a low ball offer the administrator
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
maybe agrees with it maybe changes a
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
little bit but it is a fraction of what
 
01:34:01.110 --> 01:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
the person feels they're owed and if and
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
maybe their lawyers agree with them and
 
01:34:04.149 --> 01:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
then you're stuck you gave up your
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
rights you're stuck with what they give
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
you and i
 
01:34:08.149 --> 01:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think that they should be
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
required to do that as a condition of
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
participation what i would propose is
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
and i have to admit that i am not
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
totally clear what the draft last night
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
actually means it does seem to me that
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
maybe it's inconsistent between page
 
01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
five and page seven
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
maybe jen will be able to
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
prove me wrong that it's not
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
inconsistent but i i'm not i couldn't
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
figure it out i wasn't sure what it
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
meant but
 
01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
maybe what
 
01:34:38.470 --> 01:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:40.719 align:start position:0%
rights are waived is when
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
the individual finds out what the
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
proposed award is from the administrator
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
and they can say okay i'll take it now
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
or i reject it i'm going to go back to
 
01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.109 align:start position:0%
or i reject it i'm going to go back to
to

01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
to litigation i think at that point yes
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's fair to make them make a choice
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
but to make them make a choice before
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
they have any idea what they're going to
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
get i don't think that's fair and i
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
don't think many people are going to
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
01:35:04.149 --> 01:35:04.159 align:start position:0%
so i want to repeat that just to make
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
sure i'm tracking
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
what i think i just heard you say is
 
01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.430 align:start position:0%
what i think i just heard you say is
that

01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
you would not want your claimant to
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
waive rights to another process
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
until they've entered this process
 
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
but they would have to exercise their
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
option before being told what the
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
monetary award would be that's how it is
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
now yes and that and that's what you
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
could support
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
no no that's what the way it reached now
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
no what i could support is the
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
administrator lets him know this is
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
where i'm coming down
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
your case i think your case is worth 150
 
01:35:40.239 --> 01:35:41.189 align:start position:0%
your case i think your case is worth 150
000

01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
000
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
and they and now you know
 
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh and you make at that point you make a
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
choice i take it or i don't
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
and the administrator goes if he takes
 
01:35:51.189 --> 01:35:51.199 align:start position:0%
it the minister goes forward finishes
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
the process issues a written award and
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
then you're that's done then you're done
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
and you've waived all your judicial
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
rights you give the state a release and
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification would
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
you take a question from representative
 
01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.669 align:start position:0%
you take a question from representative
umberger

01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
umberger
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
of course yeah thank you
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman
 
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
i think line three
 
01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:12.390 align:start position:0%
i think line three
says

01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
they've inserted the word simultaneously
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
which means if you enter the process
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
you can't go to court at the same time
 
01:36:25.109 --> 01:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
i mean yeah that that's that's i read
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
that that way too okay at first except
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
then i read page seven and it seems to
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
contradict that
 
01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.830 align:start position:0%
contradict that
well

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
i i guess that one of the things that is
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
concerning me is that
 
01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:42.629 align:start position:0%
concerning me is that
[Music]

01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
hopefully resolution
 
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
will occur
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
before it goes to the administrator
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
in other words we're not
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
for every case to have to go forward
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
to the administrator
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
well that's not mine thank you that's
 
01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:11.350 align:start position:0%
well that's not mine thank you that's
okay

01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:37:12.310 --> 01:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
and um so anyhow that's that's how i
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
read that is that
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
we're not suggesting
 
01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.990 align:start position:0%
we're not suggesting
that

01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
you uh you can't
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh decide to go to court
 
01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:29.430 align:start position:0%
uh decide to go to court
um

01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
but you just can't do both at the same
 
01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
time well and that's i see that's a
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
difference and if that's the case well i
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
think jen will probably clarify it i
 
01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
read it that way in page five but then i
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
went to page seven and it says by
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
requesting a resolution proceeding a
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
claimant fully waves his or her right to
 
01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
seek other relief in any other forum
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
including the judiciary
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
so i think by i don't that means at the
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
time of the claim or the time that you
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
go to the administrator but in any event
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
it's well before you know what you're
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to get
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
now again this could be possibly
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh affected
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
by a couple of other contingencies one
 
01:38:08.870 --> 01:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
is do we trust the administrator second
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
do we trust the matrix or the guidelines
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
and three are there are there no
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
arbitrary caps if those three things
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
come together and we trust all those
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
three we might be more willing to wave
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
in advance because we have a pretty good
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
idea we're going to get a fair shake but
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
right now i don't think that we can say
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
that i don't think we have that level of
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
confidence and i wouldn't be malpractice
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
for me to recommend to my clients give
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
up your only leverage before you have
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
any idea what you're going to get
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think they'd be crazy to listen
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
to me and i would be wrong to give them
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
that advice
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
so i would urge the urge the committee
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
to consider
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the award to be communicated
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
maybe just verbally to the to the
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
claimant and give him or her a chance at
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
that point to say yes i accept or no i
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
don't and please or yes i accept please
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
go forward no i don't i'm going back to
 
01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
go forward no i don't i'm going back to
court

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
so representative berger do you have a
 
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
so representative berger do you have a
follow-up

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
no no i'll uh always okay um and i'm
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
gonna go to representative lin in just a
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
second but i i just want to make sure
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
i'm understanding
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
your concern about the arbitrary limit
 
01:39:18.310 --> 01:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
when the guidelines are issued there
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
will be ranges
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
included in them and
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
and as i understand the ranges it'll
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
have a ceiling and a
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
and a floor i i did the hand drunk but
 
01:39:29.679 --> 01:39:30.390 align:start position:0%
and a floor i i did the hand drunk but
but

01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're not opposed to having a
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
a closed ended range
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
no i'm not and and it could be a range
 
01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
or it could even be just a number that
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
is uh an estimate but i i think the
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
devil's in the details i i but i if it's
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
a range
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
i i think that that's fairly standard
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
we'd see that fairly often a range but
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
that we have no idea how that those
 
01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines are actually going to come
 
01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.470 align:start position:0%
guidelines are actually going to come
out

01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.430 align:start position:0%
out
um

01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
whether they're they're going to have to
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
be agreed upon and then
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
i actually do have a point on that uh
 
01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
the process of getting there but
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh again if we had confidence in the
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
guidelines and that the ranges were fair
 
01:40:12.149 --> 01:40:12.159 align:start position:0%
and sufficient and there were no
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
arbitrary caps
 
01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
then it's possible we would be more
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
inclined to or able to recommend to our
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
clients that they waive their rights in
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
advance before they know the
 
01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
what the award's going to be
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
but okay so i'll go to representative
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
lynn i just wanted to say that i'm i'm
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
still a little confused on your concern
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
about arbitrary caps because if there's
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
a ceiling and a range it's effectively
 
01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:38.310 align:start position:0%
a ceiling and a range it's effectively
capped

01:40:38.310 --> 01:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
capped
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
well if this but if the other if there's
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
other language in here that says the cap
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
on any violent act or any violence is
 
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:45.750 align:start position:0%
on any violent act or any violence is
150

01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
150
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
150 000 and it's a 450 000
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
case you know that's the range has got
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
to obviously be going to be between 120
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
and 150 because 150 is the max
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that's an arbitrarily low
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
and you know uh
 
01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
and you know uh
standard

01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
if those caps are removed and they just
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
become the root the stat statutory caps
 
01:41:07.590 --> 01:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
that already exist well that gives us a
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
lot more room to play with and those
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
ranges can be set in at different levels
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience i think i
 
01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:15.679 align:start position:0%
understand what you mean when you say
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
arbitrary cap
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman uh mr sonata
 
01:41:23.910 --> 01:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
i guess the thing that i'm not clear on
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
is this if i i mean i think i understand
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
your position that you think
 
01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
your position that you think
the

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
you think that your clients should be
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
able to go through the process including
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh sort of not coming to an agreement
 
01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:40.719 align:start position:0%
between your client between your clients
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
through their attorneys and and the
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
going to the administrator having the
 
01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.790 align:start position:0%
going to the administrator having the
administrator

01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:41:48.790 --> 01:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue a decision saying
 
01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know i would award your client x and
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
then still being free to go to court is
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
that well i you know whether i don't put
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
the administrator to too much work
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
having to write an opinion or no no i
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand but but at some point and the
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
way this is typical in mediation the
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
mediator will say here's where i'm
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
coming out i've heard him i've heard you
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
and i've considered all the factors and
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
i i think that that 150 is a fair amount
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
sure no no i understand that but i guess
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
what i'm really saying is i mean your
 
01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
what i'm really saying is i mean your
free

01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
what you if that if we in if we
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
develop the system that way
 
01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
what i mean it seems to me it's not
 
01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
really very much different than than
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
what the law is right now i mean you and
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
the attorney general could sit down
 
01:42:31.990 --> 01:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
right now yeah and come to and and try
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
to work out a settlement and if you
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
weren't happy with it you could go to
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
court so right i guess what i'm kind of
 
01:42:38.310 --> 01:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
want i mean if we were going to allow
 
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.550 align:start position:0%
want i mean if we were going to allow
that

01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
my sense of what do we need this
 
01:42:43.590 --> 01:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislation for why don't you just you
 
01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
know well you're right why don't you and
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney general just sit down and
 
01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
work it out and we can always do that
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
even with this legislation right right
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
and our judge shulman is already after
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
us to sit down for mediation now to push
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
us on that and but that's why we want
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
this process to be as much like the
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
mediation that we're familiar with
 
01:43:02.870 --> 01:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh and uh
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
because otherwise our clients will
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
probably choose that over this
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
and um i think this is a better could be
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
a better process and could make expedite
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
things a lot and be better for the state
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
but i i think i i think it's unfair
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
to ask somebody
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh who's
 
01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
all they have is it the judicial claim
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
and ask them to give up in advance that
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
one piece of leverage that they have the
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
only power they have
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
before they have some idea pretty good
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
idea what uh
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
what their case is going to be worth
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
with the administrator i just don't
 
01:43:38.070 --> 01:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
think that people are going to do it i
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that i can recommend it now
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
again if the guidelines are well
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
developed and we agree to the guidelines
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
and they are
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
sufficient and the ranges
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
are are adequate
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
and we trust the administrator that
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
could be different that might make it
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
different but those are contingencies
 
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
that have not been decided yet
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know and that at that point we might
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
be able to advise
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's worth taking the risk go through
 
01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
the process because you're pretty sure
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
to get something that's pretty fair but
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
right now we can't say that you know
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i also kind of relatedly and this is
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
going back to those guidelines uh and
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the giraffe last
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
night does is it it kind of
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
seems like an awfully elaborate process
 
01:44:22.629 --> 01:44:22.639 align:start position:0%
to come up with these guidelines and
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
then it's not clear that the guidelines
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
are mandatory or advisory or
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
are they presumptively what the range
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
would be for a particular act or group
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
of acts it's it's not really clear and i
 
01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
also note it um
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
the guidelines have to be developed
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
before the administrator is picked i
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
kind of feel like
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
it would be wiser to do it the other way
 
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
the reverse which is pick the
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
administrator and then the ag and the
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
council have to sit down and work on the
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines but they have the benefit of
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
input from a neutral third party the
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
administrator who is also presumably a
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
wise man or woman who's knowledgeable in
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
this area and will help them because i
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
could see these guidelines being very
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
difficult to come up with
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
and and the ag will come at it they're
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
going to lowball as much as they can and
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get as much as we
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
can for our clients because that's what
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's the the what our civilized
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
society that's the set of incentives
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we've set up because
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
no they have no other friends except us
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
so we're there to fight for them and
 
01:45:22.070 --> 01:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we're doing and the a.g
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
meanwhile is a duty to get the best deal
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
for the state so you've got the two
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
partisans hit button heads wouldn't it
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
be good to have an administrator in the
 
01:45:31.109 --> 01:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
middle to kind of who doesn't have a dog
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the fight
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
to help them get to agreement on those
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines because i could see that
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
being a point at which this whole
 
01:45:38.790 --> 01:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
process could break down the other point
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
i think where it could break down is
 
01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:42.159 align:start position:0%
bringing the guidelines back to the
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
finance committee um i i don't i think
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a really tough thing
 
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think at some point the legislature
 
01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
just got to trust
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
the experts and the parties to some
 
01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:52.950 align:start position:0%
the experts and the parties to some
degree

01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh based on expertise because how do
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
what's it going to look like it comes
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
back to the finance committee you're
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about very explicit
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
graphic physical sexual acts or abuse
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
abusive acts and trying to put a number
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
on them and subject it to a public
 
01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:08.950 align:start position:0%
on them and subject it to a public
debate

01:46:08.950 --> 01:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
debate
 
01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:09.910 align:start position:0%
debate
and

01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
what is this worth and what is that
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
worth and i don't
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know i see that as being very
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
awkward very unwieldy and of a decision
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
point that is another opportunity for
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
this whole process to break down
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i kind of see i feel that the way
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's proposed now is too complex too
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
many junctures at which it can fail
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
i wish it could be streamlined uh the
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
way we would do it and the way we do it
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
in front of judge shulman is we we
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
sit down and we'd have to argue it out
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the judge would probably act as a
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
well the judge probably wouldn't do it
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
judge would appoint a mediator and the
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
mediator would be a neutral without a
 
01:46:46.070 --> 01:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
dog in the fight and help us get to
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
agreement and see the weaknesses on our
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
case or the strengths in the other
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
side's case and get to an agreement that
 
01:46:53.910 --> 01:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
way but this has so many different
 
01:46:55.510 --> 01:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
layers of approval
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
and discussion and i i just see it
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
failing if it remains the way it is
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to go to representative
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
weiler here in just a moment but i i
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
want to comment that we we did talk
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
about the finance committee reviewing
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
these um
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
last session yes and uh it's not our
 
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.350 align:start position:0%
last session yes and uh it's not our
money

01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's the taxpayers money yeah and so
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think what the thought was was
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
let's do this in a way in which it's
 
01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
transparent to the public since they're
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
the ones writing the check ultimately
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
there's a finance committee we make
 
01:47:38.709 --> 01:47:38.719 align:start position:0%
financial decisions we expect results we
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
have an audit division that we task with
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
bringing us the results
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
this you're bringing us forth something
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
that has no results except for you
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
does it cure the problem
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
does it help the victims
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
are they still going to be
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
ps ptsd at post traumatic stress and so
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
on nothing of that will change
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
and how do you assess which one is worse
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
off are you going to do a psycho
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
analysis of each victim to find out how
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
damaged each one in is that included are
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
you gonna have group therapy sessions
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
none of that's proposed you're just
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
looking for money what does the money do
 
01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:15.910 align:start position:0%
looking for money what does the money do
nothing

01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned it's a waste all
 
01:48:20.790 --> 01:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is save time for the
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the courts by
 
01:48:23.199 --> 01:48:24.229 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the courts by
offering

01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
offering
 
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:26.320 align:start position:0%
and you're just trying to expand it this
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
to say oh someone's punished by
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement what precedent does
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
that set everyone in the prison can come
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
in here and sue us because they suffered
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
from solitary confinement i refuse to
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
widen this i i thank you mr g
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you i i
 
01:48:47.109 --> 01:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that um
 
01:48:50.070 --> 01:48:50.080 align:start position:0%
in in these hearings our goal is to
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
collect information that we can talk and
 
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
talk about later and um i i
 
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
we don't want to berate
 
01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.109 align:start position:0%
we don't want to berate
um

01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
any of the witnesses and i i think we
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
got a little close
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
can i speak uh
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman
 
01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
oh sure i appreciate the comments from
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
from representative weiler i i and i've
 
01:49:16.870 --> 01:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
looked i'm i could retire tomorrow i
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't need to be doing this i i figure i
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
got 10 good years left i want to do this
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
so passionately about what happened to
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
these kids
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to be deterred
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
but i i appreciate your comments but i
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
do think they kind of illustrate my
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
point earlier which is
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know everybody's got an opinion and
 
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
i think if we
 
01:49:41.510 --> 01:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't streamline the process it's going
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
to fall apart
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't think it should fall apart i
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't think i think my first goal of
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
course is protecting the victims and
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
getting them some form of justice
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
and you're right that money never is
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient it never is of course it's
 
01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.030 align:start position:0%
sufficient it never is of course it's
not

01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
but we can't undo the past the only
 
01:49:59.109 --> 01:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
thing we can do is what the civil system
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
does and that it's a recognition of in
 
01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:02.639 align:start position:0%
some way of
 
01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
the harm and it's some form of an
 
01:50:06.709 --> 01:50:06.719 align:start position:0%
apology to those kids who suffered at
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
the hands of the state for so many years
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate your comments but i do
 
01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
think it kind of illustrates if if it's
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
an open
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
open field for conversation and
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
discussion and debate i'm not sure it's
 
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
ever going to get done um there has to
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
be some room room for deference to folks
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
who actually do this and who actually
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
talk to the victims and who have
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
expertise in the area i'm not sure and i
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
try to come up with a more concrete
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
proposal than those abstract notions i'm
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
talking about right now but i do want i
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
feel like i want to make that point or
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
if you put too many junctures in which
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
the process can break down then it will
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
all right i i don't i don't want to rush
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
you do you think you're you're done with
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
your main points
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
um i had uh one more
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh and it
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that's a main one but it's
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
on page five of our summary
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
and this is um again i'm not
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
kind i'm not entirely clear about what
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
the ag is proposing here page 7 line 34.
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
the administrator's decision regarding
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the claim shall be final and
 
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:13.510 align:start position:0%
the claim shall be final and
non-appealable

01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
non-appealable
 
01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then certain provisions of rsa 542
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
will not apply
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
i think the concern here is the a.g
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't want an appeal
 
01:51:24.310 --> 01:51:24.320 align:start position:0%
after the administrator makes a decision
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i agree with that that's fine with
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
fine with us
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
except i mean obviously if there's an
 
01:51:31.510 --> 01:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
appeal based on a plain error a mistake
 
01:51:33.830 --> 01:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
mathematical mistake something like that
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
or i i i still think you should have
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
access to the courts to correct it if if
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
there is such a a problem i don't
 
01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate there will be
 
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
but our concern here
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
is because we are
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh putting together kind of a form of
 
01:51:48.239 --> 01:51:49.589 align:start position:0%
uh putting together kind of a form of
arbitration

01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
arbitration
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
is that we want the award of an
 
01:51:53.109 --> 01:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
administrator to be
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
a final and enforceable judgment
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that's the intention here
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
but i i have to say that i feel like the
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
language isn't that clear
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
and we've gone back and forth with the
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
ag several times and i i don't know if
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking past each other or maybe
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're not understanding but our goal
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
here is that once you have waived your
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
judicial rights and you've got an orb
 
01:52:15.589 --> 01:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
you've got the administrator's award
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
that it is enforceable
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
and typically to do that you have to go
 
01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
to court and have the court bless it
 
01:52:23.589 --> 01:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
under the arbitration statute and say
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
yup it is now a final judgment i've
 
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
reviewed it
 
01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
reviewed it
and

01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:29.669 --> 01:52:29.679 align:start position:0%
it's now enforceable
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we have to do that but i
 
01:52:32.390 --> 01:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it's final and
 
01:52:34.390 --> 01:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
enforceable that's all it's our only
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
concern how we get there i'm open to
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
open to suggestions but i did make the
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
comments in the margin
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
which i is our attempt at least to
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
provide some language that would help us
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm hoping that when the ag's
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
office comes up to the table that they
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
can address that issue
 
01:52:56.390 --> 01:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
all right yes
 
01:52:57.990 --> 01:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
wha what else you got for that that's
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
those are the main points that i had and
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
and i i appreciate the opportunity to
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
comment further on the issue of the um
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
appointment of the administrator in the
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
next few days and i will do so uh but
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
those are the points i mean it's
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
not discriminating against any of the
 
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:15.030 align:start position:0%
not discriminating against any of the
victims

01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
victims
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh not making them give up their rights
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh unduly without having some idea
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
what they're gonna get
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
um and then the independence of the
 
01:53:23.119 --> 01:53:24.629 align:start position:0%
um and then the independence of the
administrator

01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh all right uh thank you very much for
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%

01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%

i believe uh the most recent
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
version of legislation that i was able
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
to look at last night includes reference
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
to structured settlements um i'm here
 
01:55:13.679 --> 01:55:14.629 align:start position:0%
to structured settlements um i'm here
today

01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
to uh to talk a little bit about what
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
they are how the parties involved
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
operate when a structured settlement is
 
01:55:23.189 --> 01:55:23.199 align:start position:0%
utilized and answer any questions that
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
this committee may have
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
so for those of you who are not familiar
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
with the structured settlement it is
 
01:55:31.510 --> 01:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
basically it's an alternative to a lump
 
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.629 align:start position:0%
basically it's an alternative to a lump
sum

01:55:32.629 --> 01:55:32.639 align:start position:0%
sum
 
01:55:34.390 --> 01:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
where a
 
01:55:36.790 --> 01:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
claimant as part of an injury settlement
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
can receive their proceeds
 
01:55:40.870 --> 01:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
in fixed and determinate tax-free
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
guaranteed payments as opposed to a lump
 
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.149 align:start position:0%
guaranteed payments as opposed to a lump
sum

01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
sum
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
i have worked with injury victims
 
01:55:49.669 --> 01:55:49.679 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and personal injury
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
attorneys throughout new hampshire and
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
new england for most of my career
 
01:55:55.830 --> 01:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
but our our industry has also been
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
involved in similar mass tort
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
legislations like we're talking about
 
01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.830 align:start position:0%
legislations like we're talking about
today

01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
we were recently very involved in the
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
michigan state sex abuse victims fund
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
we've also been involved in the station
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
fire victims fund the 911 victims
 
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
compensation fund
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
the boston archdiocese fund to name a
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
few so we are we're familiar with this
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
this form of of fund as well
 
01:56:17.599 --> 01:56:18.790 align:start position:0%
this form of of fund as well
um

01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
a structured settlement exists primarily
 
01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.229 align:start position:0%
a structured settlement exists primarily
for

01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
unwilling or want wants to have their
 
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
payments spread out over time
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
in a guaranteed tax-free manner and
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's the way that that structures
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
operate and they are often
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
very well utilized in in the types of
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
victims we're talking about with this
 
01:56:40.239 --> 01:56:44.070 align:start position:0%
victims we're talking about with this
legislation

01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
my services as somebody who who works
 
01:56:49.270 --> 01:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the attorneys the victims and often
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
the insurers or in this case the state
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
is to customize that that
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
those plans
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
educate the parties about what the
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
process is
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
my services come at no cost
 
01:57:05.109 --> 01:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
the entire award that goes into a
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
structured settlement is invested in the
 
01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:07.910 align:start position:0%
structured settlement is invested in the
annuity

01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
annuity
 
01:57:09.350 --> 01:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
and importantly
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
the state which which
 
01:57:12.950 --> 01:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
in this case would be purchasing the
 
01:57:15.910 --> 01:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
annuity on the victim's behalf
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
also pays no fees and has no ongoing
 
01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.669 align:start position:0%
also pays no fees and has no ongoing
obligation

01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
by a mechanism what's called a qualified
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
assignment i have materials to to
 
01:57:25.109 --> 01:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
explain that a little bit further
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
the state has no ongoing obligation of a
 
01:57:28.629 --> 01:57:28.639 align:start position:0%
structured settlement is entered into
 
01:57:30.390 --> 01:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
they they are released just as if they
 
01:57:32.790 --> 01:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
are issuing a lump sum payment
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
and the
the

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:57:37.109 --> 01:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
obligation to make those future periodic
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
payments is transferred to the annuity
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
issuer all of the annuity issuers that
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
that we work with in the structured
 
01:57:44.950 --> 01:57:44.960 align:start position:0%
settlement industry are a or rated
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
better uh companies by am best these are
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
life insurance companies um that you are
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
most likely familiar with companies like
 
01:57:54.629 --> 01:57:54.639 align:start position:0%
metlife pacific life mutual of omaha
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
usaa um
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
the the my purpose here today is
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
especially now that there is reference
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
to structured settlements included in
 
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
the legislation as an option for our
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
claimant to
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
elect should they wish to go that route
 
01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:09.350 align:start position:0%
elect should they wish to go that route
is

01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you may
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
have and
 
01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to do that now
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i i have a question for you have you
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
seen the document that we uh received
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
today called hb 1677
 
01:58:28.229 --> 01:58:28.239 align:start position:0%
second recommended amendment by a.g i
 
01:58:30.070 --> 01:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
believe so yes i believe i received that
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
are you satisfied that the language in
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
this document is appropriate
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
yes i i think that it provides the
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
option for somebody if they wish to go
 
01:58:47.990 --> 01:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
that route to elect to do so and and
 
01:58:49.990 --> 01:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
importantly the language that's in there
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
also protects the state uh there's a
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
reference to a qualified assignment um
 
01:58:55.589 --> 01:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
under section 130 the tax code and and
 
01:58:56.950 --> 01:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
from the state's perspective that's what
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make sure that was in there
 
01:58:59.669 --> 01:58:59.679 align:start position:0%
as well to make sure that that
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
obligation is transferred away from the
 
01:59:03.430 --> 01:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
state should somebody receiving an award
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
from the fund elected to do a structured
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
settlement okay so i'm i'm viewing you
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
as a a friendly witness that you've
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
you think that what the ag's doing is
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate and the right the
 
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
right words are in this
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
draft i i think that the language
 
01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
specific to structured settlements
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
that's in the most recent version is
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate from my chair as a
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
structured settlement expert yes well
 
01:59:28.950 --> 01:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um
 
01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh representative weiler
 
01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
what savings do you offer us or do we
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
make this payment
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
in totality up front
 
01:59:41.750 --> 01:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
it it it
 
01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
generally depends um
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
the savings are not necessarily
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
an aspect of it as much as
 
01:59:51.750 --> 01:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
the award that the administrator would
 
01:59:53.589 --> 01:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
would issue would be the amount that
 
01:59:55.109 --> 01:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:59:55.119 --> 01:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
that is
final

01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
what what the victim then has the option
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
to do instead of taking that lump sum
 
02:00:03.030 --> 02:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and then perhaps either mismanaging
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
it or you know whatever the case may be
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where there's a
 
02:00:08.709 --> 02:00:08.719 align:start position:0%
secondary savings um in that by
 
02:00:11.189 --> 02:00:11.199 align:start position:0%
providing them guaranteed fixed payments
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
as a form of income
 
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
prevents premature dissipation of the
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
funds which could also then prevent
 
02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
somebody you know going on on state
 
02:00:21.430 --> 02:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
services or things like that so i think
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
non-quantifiable savings in that sense
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
but there is also no as i mentioned no
 
02:00:32.629 --> 02:00:32.639 align:start position:0%
obligation for the state um in terms of
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing obligation to fund those so that
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
the amount that the administrator would
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
award would be the same whether whether
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um isn't it true
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
that if somebody elects a structured
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
settlement it saves the state the
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
administrative costs because within this
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's an option for the victim to to
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
take their payments over time even if
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
they don't go through you
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
and at least on the last draft i saw i
 
02:01:12.470 --> 02:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the language in the most
 
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
current draft and if a victim elected to
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
take their payments over time
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
if if they elect to go through a
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
structured settlement through one of the
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies doesn't that then
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
remove from the state all the
 
02:01:26.390 --> 02:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
administrative obligations on that with
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
respect to dispensing the money with
 
02:01:29.830 --> 02:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
respect to taxation all those kinds of
 
02:01:31.990 --> 02:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
things yeah yes as i read the most
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
current form of the legislation as i
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned i just got it last night but
 
02:01:38.070 --> 02:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
the way that that i understand it and
 
02:01:39.189 --> 02:01:39.199 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office can
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong is that
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
essentially there are three options one
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
is a lump sum the other is for the state
 
02:01:46.790 --> 02:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
to fund payments installments over i
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
believe it's up to a period of 10 years
 
02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
or for the claimant to elect a
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
structured settlement
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
of the two that require ongoing
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
installment or periodic payments um if
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
this the option that the state funding
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
those payments would require the state
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
to keep a book open to basically fund
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
those in the accounting that goes there
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
with um with the structured settlement
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
it it functions the same as if um as if
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
it were a lump sum so there there is a
 
02:02:14.950 --> 02:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
full and final release on on all claims
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and the state closes their obligation
 
02:02:19.109 --> 02:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
just as if they were issuing a lump sum
 
02:02:20.550 --> 02:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
so from from the state's perspective
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
there's there's no difference in
 
02:02:24.870 --> 02:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
accounting and ongoing obligation
 
02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:26.229 align:start position:0%
accounting and ongoing obligation
follow-up

02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:02:28.629 --> 02:02:28.639 align:start position:0%
um so this as you may or may not know
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court has something
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
called rule 40 that pertains to
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
structured settlements with respect to
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
minors how does that fit into what you
 
02:02:36.639 --> 02:02:37.669 align:start position:0%
minors how does that fit into what you
offer

02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
offer
 
02:02:39.669 --> 02:02:39.679 align:start position:0%
um i'm very very familiar with that um
 
02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
as a
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
as a new hampshire resident and as a
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
structured settlement purveyor here rule
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
40 comes up on every single case that we
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
deal with with miners and i understand
 
02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
that um miners are are not you know are
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
some of the claims will be miners not
 
02:02:56.709 --> 02:02:56.719 align:start position:0%
all of them will be um rule 40 um
 
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
is is basically a list of um court
 
02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.830 align:start position:0%
is is basically a list of um court
mandated

02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
mandated
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
annuity issuers that we have to use when
 
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:05.360 align:start position:0%
miners are involved they are not
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
radically different than what we would
 
02:03:08.950 --> 02:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
use with anybody else it's slightly more
 
02:03:11.910 --> 02:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive there are about seven um or
 
02:03:13.350 --> 02:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
eight annuity companies at issue
 
02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
structured settlements i believe roughly
 
02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
five of them are approved um under rule
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
40 for minors
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
the only other difference with with rule
 
02:03:23.189 --> 02:03:23.199 align:start position:0%
40 cases is
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
i'm required to submit an affidavit to
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
the court rule 40 is is has to do with
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
the court's approval of the settlement
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
um when a structured settlement has
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
evolved um
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
my office will make sure that all the
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
documents are compliant with rule 40. uh
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
i sign an affidavit for every rule 40
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
case complying that the the annuity
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
meets the standards that are outlined in
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
that rule um and um
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
all of the companies that we use and
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
specifically the ones that are outlined
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
major u.s life insurers with very high
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
ratings and that that would apply not
 
02:03:57.350 --> 02:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
just to minors but to all the cases that
 
02:03:59.910 --> 02:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay i'm
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any other questions
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh do you do you believe you've uh told
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
us everything you think we need to know
 
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
i i believe so the one thing i i would
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
add is just in terms of what my role is
 
02:04:18.149 --> 02:04:18.159 align:start position:0%
as as a structured settlement consultant
 
02:04:20.229 --> 02:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
um you know beyond i wanted to make sure
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
i addressed what the state's obligation
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
or lack thereof would be but from the
 
02:04:26.550 --> 02:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
victims perspective you know
 
02:04:28.550 --> 02:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i do
 
02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that future needs are
 
02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:31.270 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that future needs are
met

02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
met
 
02:04:33.350 --> 02:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
i am not a financial planner i am not a
 
02:04:35.669 --> 02:04:35.679 align:start position:0%
wealth manager that is not my practice
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the people that i
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
work with are people who
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
have never come into large sums of money
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
at one time
 
02:04:43.199 --> 02:04:44.149 align:start position:0%
at one time
and

02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
often need some assistance to make sure
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
that their future needs are met and that
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that i do
 
02:04:51.189 --> 02:04:51.199 align:start position:0%
our industry has done several
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
dissipation studies over the years to
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
show what happens to somebody when they
 
02:04:56.390 --> 02:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
come into a large amount of money in a
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
short period of time um as i'm sure
 
02:05:01.030 --> 02:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're aware too though the most common
 
02:05:03.270 --> 02:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
form of this is is with you know lottery
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
winners professional athletes things
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the people that
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
come up in these studies
 
02:05:13.510 --> 02:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
the evidence shows that the money does
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
not last nearly as long as they expect
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
it to
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that a structured
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
settlement does is provide them with
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
guaranteed income
 
02:05:26.069 --> 02:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
it is an extremely simple vehicle as i
 
02:05:28.229 --> 02:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned it is an it's an annuity with
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
fixed indeterminate payments so the
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
payment stream is customized and my job
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
is to work with the the victim to
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
customize that payment stream to meet
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
their needs
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
but the payments are determinant they
 
02:05:40.069 --> 02:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
are set on guaranteed dates the amounts
 
02:05:42.149 --> 02:05:42.159 align:start position:0%
cannot change they they cannot be
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
altered they cannot be accessed early
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
and it is a it is a good way to make
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
sure that those needs are met over time
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
without them um
 
02:05:51.920 --> 02:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
without them um
inadvertently

02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
inadvertently
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
spending the money in ways that was not
 
02:05:55.040 --> 02:05:56.149 align:start position:0%
spending the money in ways that was not
intended

02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
intended
 
02:05:57.430 --> 02:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
so my job is to work with them to
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
customize those payment streams and and
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
not the entire amount has to go into a
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
structured sentiment either
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
one of my roles um is to kind of figure
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
out what the immediate needs are if
 
02:06:07.030 --> 02:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
somebody has
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
needs for housing or vehicles or things
 
02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:11.679 align:start position:0%
like that it's an it's a voluntary
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
procedure where we can just kind of give
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
them that option
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
to provide those payments again at no at
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
no risk or no future obligation for the
 
02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
for the funding entity
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
all right uh thank you very much for
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%

02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
and you're with representing whom the
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bulletin
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
news site and also the new hampshire
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
press association's legislative affairs
 
02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:29.830 align:start position:0%
press association's legislative affairs
committee

02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
so i just had a few brief points about
 
02:07:36.629 --> 02:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
the right to know law aspect of this
 
02:07:36.639 --> 02:07:38.149 align:start position:0%
the right to know law aspect of this
bill

02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to start by saying our
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
constitution is exceptional in that it
 
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
puts in writing that there is presumed
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
an open access to government because
 
02:07:48.229 --> 02:07:48.239 align:start position:0%
that is how you hold government
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
accountable and
 
02:07:52.310 --> 02:07:52.320 align:start position:0%
i think the records in this case which
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
are preemptively clothed under the
 
02:07:56.310 --> 02:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
are important because if i could offer
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
the example of the catholic church
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
settlement that the state engaged in
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
many years ago now
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
the attorney general decided in that
 
02:08:08.950 --> 02:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
case that the best course was not to
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
take the church through the court
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
process but to release the records of
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
the church's handling of abuse claims
 
02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.709 align:start position:0%
the church's handling of abuse claims
over

02:08:16.709 --> 02:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
decades because it's important to know
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
what happened and how it happened and
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's how you find out and those
 
02:08:25.270 --> 02:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
records were released thousands of pages
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
each one the names of the victims and
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
their identifying information was
 
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
redacted and so the privacy concern was
 
02:08:34.550 --> 02:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
protected but the public
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
knew and understood how the abuse
 
02:08:36.719 --> 02:08:37.990 align:start position:0%
knew and understood how the abuse
happened

02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
and what failed what how those victims
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
were failed
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that's why i think the case the
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
records here are important i see a
 
02:08:45.679 --> 02:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
records here are important i see a
similar

02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
i see it as similar
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
in that this is a state agency we know
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
that there are many victims of the
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
handling of this we should know and the
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
public should know what happened what
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
was the extent of it what did the state
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
know what did the state not know and how
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
were those concerns handled
 
02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
the ag's office did and i appreciate
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
this make clear in the proposed
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
amendment or changes that we we have put
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
we were very clear that the settlement
 
02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
the actual settlement in these cases
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
will be available to the public and i do
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that inclusion i know that
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
was raised by the new hampshire right to
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
know committee and i am grateful that
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
they heard that concern
 
02:09:29.669 --> 02:09:29.679 align:start position:0%
that is already part of the law so
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
while i'm glad it's in there
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
it is necessary it doesn't resolve my
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
other concerns we do have a right to
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
know law that i think works well and i
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
say that
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
having used it for 25 years even when i
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
didn't get the records that i want
 
02:09:48.629 --> 02:09:48.639 align:start position:0%
because there it requires a balancing
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
test there's records i want there's
 
02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
records that the agency or town doesn't
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
want to give up and in the way attorney
 
02:09:58.629 --> 02:09:58.639 align:start position:0%
visananzo mentioned that there needs to
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
be a neutral party that party is the
 
02:10:03.910 --> 02:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
court and in that process the court
 
02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
considers from from a neutral
 
02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:07.109 align:start position:0%
considers from from a neutral
perspective

02:10:07.109 --> 02:10:07.119 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
what we want to know what is
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
considered private by the state or the
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
town and comes to a conclusion what
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
should be released and how and when
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is a record that
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
is partially
 
02:10:20.719 --> 02:10:22.149 align:start position:0%
is partially
confidential

02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
02:10:24.310 --> 02:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
it is released with that information
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
redacted it does not require that the
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
whole document be redacted it's very
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
specific about that
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i think in this case just my last
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
point is that we are preemptively
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
excluding from public
 
02:10:38.159 --> 02:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
excluding from public
record

02:10:39.350 --> 02:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
record
 
02:10:41.430 --> 02:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
records we don't even know yet
 
02:10:43.350 --> 02:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
what they exist
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeking information about how
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
advises or handles the legal aspects of
 
02:10:53.910 --> 02:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
this case but i do think we should
 
02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
this case but i do think we should
know

02:10:54.790 --> 02:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:10:57.589 --> 02:10:57.599 align:start position:0%
or easily have an access to ask for
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
records that show what happened in this
 
02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
case and how it was handled and how it
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't handled and that happens through
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
the right to no law which i think works
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:11.430 --> 02:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
represent amber
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes um
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
i guess that uh from one of the problems
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
is is that we are dealing with juveniles
 
02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
is is that we are dealing with juveniles
and

02:11:21.350 --> 02:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
how much currently are juvenile records
 
02:11:25.199 --> 02:11:26.390 align:start position:0%
how much currently are juvenile records
released

02:11:26.390 --> 02:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
released
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
when you ask for them under the right to
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
know i'm just not sure thank you for the
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
question they are protected and so in
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
that case i think that is the court's
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to look at is there any
 
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
part of that that could be
 
02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.109 align:start position:0%
part of that that could be
released

02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
released
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think the name should come out i
 
02:11:45.510 --> 02:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
don't think the dates of birth should be
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
released and that's the standard now but
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
what did happen to this group of people
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
who were juveniles and that might help
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
us understand because in this case they
 
02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.470 align:start position:0%
us understand because in this case they
were

02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
especially vulnerable and so how did the
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
state handle those complaints as a group
 
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know not as an individual per se if
 
02:12:05.589 --> 02:12:05.599 align:start position:0%
the court felt like that was
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just i'm just
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
trying to come to grips with this so
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
you would say that
 
02:12:21.599 --> 02:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
you would say that
um

02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:22.090 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:22.090 --> 02:12:23.750 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:12:23.750 --> 02:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:12:26.069 --> 02:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
you you would go to court
 
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
to get the information that you wanted
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
or is it something that you think should
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
be part of
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
the process i'm just trying to i'm just
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
trying to come to grips with
 
02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
we know this is dealing with juveniles
 
02:12:46.830 --> 02:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
so the process yeah and it's hard to
 
02:12:50.239 --> 02:12:51.189 align:start position:0%
so the process yeah and it's hard to
know

02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
a bit because we don't have the records
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
yet but the way the process works now is
 
02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:56.390 align:start position:0%
yet but the way the process works now is
we

02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
or the public request a record um in
 
02:13:02.149 --> 02:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
this case it may be the records
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
tied to a settlement of a particular
 
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.189 align:start position:0%
tied to a settlement of a particular
person

02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:13:05.199 --> 02:13:06.069 align:start position:0%
person
and

02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
we would want to know what happened
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
generally in this case because i think
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
if you see
 
02:13:13.510 --> 02:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
these cases as they stack up you might
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
see a trend or a pattern so in this case
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
we would ask for that record
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
the court may say no you can't have any
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
of it because there's nothing in here
 
02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we can't that we could release
 
02:13:26.229 --> 02:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
without identifying the person but in
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
the case of the catholic church
 
02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
the case of the catholic church
situation

02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
the names of the victims who were
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
juveniles was redacted
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
their lo their addresses at the time
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
were redacted but we did know
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
how the grooming process worked we saw
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
letters back and forth to the church
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
that sowed we knew at the time that this
 
02:13:49.119 --> 02:13:50.390 align:start position:0%
that sowed we knew at the time that this
child

02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:51.510 align:start position:0%
child
mother

02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
mother
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
complained and nothing was done they
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
moved that priest to another parish so
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
in that way we don't know who the child
 
02:13:59.430 --> 02:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
is but we know
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
how there was a complaint raised at the
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
time by a parent for example and that
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
the church decided
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
to handle in a way that maybe wasn't
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
on the side of the victim in that case
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up uh so miss timmons
 
02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:18.069 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up uh so miss timmons
uh

02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
sometime i think prior to the previous
 
02:14:21.199 --> 02:14:22.310 align:start position:0%
sometime i think prior to the previous
hearing

02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
the ag's office
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
provided us with a an example
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the kind of settlement form that they
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
they would uh be completing
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
and what on it would be available for
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
the public and what would be redacted
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
have you seen that form
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
i haven't i had reached out um probably
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
not in the the right way i guess to get
 
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
some more information from the attorney
 
02:14:47.830 --> 02:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
general's office and to share my
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
concerns but didn't hear back and i'm
 
02:14:52.870 --> 02:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
sure that's just a matter of
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
getting lost and
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
enroute but i have not seen that
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay so let me ask
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
i feel like monty hall here uh
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
ag's office do you happen to have a copy
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
of that example redacted form that we
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
could get to miss timmons
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
oh there we go
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's fifty dollars for
 
02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.390 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's fifty dollars for
mike

02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
mike
 
02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:17.669 align:start position:0%
mike
uh

02:15:17.669 --> 02:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay door number three
 
02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
you do you wanna take a look at that and
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
then come back up sure yeah thank you
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
that would be great all right uh and
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
have you looked at this second amended
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
draft that the ag's office has put
 
02:15:33.199 --> 02:15:34.310 align:start position:0%
draft that the ag's office has put
together

02:15:34.310 --> 02:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.119 align:start position:0%
the the version that's on the table yes
 
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that that's where i see that they
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
did um
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
sort of respond to the request of the
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
group and say we understand that the
 
02:15:46.709 --> 02:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
settlement so i guess that would be this
 
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
piece these papers here would be
 
02:15:51.510 --> 02:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
available and that that's that exists in
 
02:15:52.950 --> 02:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
the right to know a lot now but i do
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate them hearing that
 
02:15:57.189 --> 02:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay so do you do you think at the end
 
02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
of the day here you've got any specific
 
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
requests for language
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
modification i would like that section
 
02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:07.109 align:start position:0%
modification i would like that section
removed

02:16:07.109 --> 02:16:07.119 align:start position:0%
removed
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
so just a
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
a wholesale deletion yes because i think
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
we have a process i don't think it's
 
02:16:15.030 --> 02:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
necessary legislation because there's a
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
process in place that the legislature
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
has already
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
adopted and has left in place for many
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
many years
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for your answer are
 
02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
there other questions representative
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
walls i see some movement do you have
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
no all right with that um thank you very
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
much if i could ask one question do you
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
want me to um respond in writing to some
 
02:16:40.389 --> 02:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
concerns about that would that be
 
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
easiest for the committee or would you
 
02:16:43.750 --> 02:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
like me to come back up so
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
so you're welcome to do it how you wish
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
i i i'm just wanting to make sure that
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
you've seen
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
the example that the ag's office has
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
already provided to the committee
 
02:16:58.870 --> 02:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
so that any concerns that you still have
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
can either be addressed or
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know so if you if if you look at
 
02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
that and you want to come back up we can
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
do that if you want to do it in writing
 
02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:08.800 align:start position:0%
we can do it in writing i think i'll
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
take choice b i'd like to take it back
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
to the legislative affairs committee and
 
02:17:14.549 --> 02:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
just have a quick look at it so we're on
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
the same page okay now mike do you need
 
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
your copy back okay because we have a
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
xerox machine next door
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%

that's probably the wrong phrase i would
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
i would just continue the hearing but i
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if there's anyone
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
who has dietary needs where they have to
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%

02:19:21.509 --> 02:19:21.519 align:start position:0%
amendment so a summary change sheet so i
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
thought i would use that as a guide for
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
our discussion so i'll go through that
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
look at the specific language that this
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
summary sheet references
 
02:19:33.589 --> 02:19:33.599 align:start position:0%
so these change just at a high level
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
these changes are based on what we
 
02:19:37.830 --> 02:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussed at the last work session
 
02:19:40.230 --> 02:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
they're also based on discussions we
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
have continued to have both with
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
claimants council and other
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the trial lawyers
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
and the structure the folks who are
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
talking about structured settlements um
 
02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.429 align:start position:0%
talking about structured settlements um
and

02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
and uh others who have wanted to have
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
input on this process so um that's
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where these come from
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
they they are also reflect our judgment
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
as to what we would recommend and what
 
02:20:03.910 --> 02:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
we think
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
is workable for the state
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the ultimate decision
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
is up to you all
 
02:20:13.750 --> 02:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
so the first group of changes in this
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
second amended draft
 
02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:17.270 align:start position:0%
second amended draft
is

02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
are changes that are designed to go to
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
the concerns regarding the administrator
 
02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the appointment of the administrator
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
the independence of the administrator so
 
02:20:27.270 --> 02:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
that there can be trusted the
 
02:20:27.280 --> 02:20:28.550 align:start position:0%
that there can be trusted the
administrator

02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:20:30.469 --> 02:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
and as uh was discussed earlier by
 
02:20:32.870 --> 02:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
attorney vicenzo what we have come up
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
with uh based on our internal thinking
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
discussions with some members of this
 
02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.309 align:start position:0%
discussions with some members of this
committee

02:20:38.309 --> 02:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:20:40.389 --> 02:20:40.399 align:start position:0%
and based on the the desire to have
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
independence is to have the
 
02:20:42.319 --> 02:20:43.750 align:start position:0%
independence is to have the
administrator

02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
be a temporary employee housed within
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
02:20:52.309 --> 02:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see that first on page 1 lines 11
 
02:20:53.750 --> 02:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
through 13
 
02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
where we're just defining
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
you will see the real
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
substance of this on page 2
 
02:21:07.590 --> 02:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
lines 20 through 38.
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
this is where we create the temporary
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
position the administrator who can be
 
02:21:13.110 --> 02:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
either an attorney admitted to practice
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire or a retired judge
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
they would be a temporary employee
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
within the judicial branch
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
they would receive the same salary as a
 
02:21:22.950 --> 02:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
superior court judge
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the appointment of this person would
 
02:21:29.429 --> 02:21:29.439 align:start position:0%
be this is all in lines 20-38
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
the appointment of this person would be
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
a joint exercise between our office and
 
02:21:36.790 --> 02:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
claimant's counsel and the supreme court
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
and what we have suggested is that we
 
02:21:40.710 --> 02:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
would work with claimants counsel to
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
come up with a list of acceptable
 
02:21:45.349 --> 02:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
candidates we would submit that list to
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
the supreme court and the supreme court
 
02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
would make the selection
 
02:21:52.389 --> 02:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
under that mechanism it's possible that
 
02:21:54.389 --> 02:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
that we could just agree on someone and
 
02:21:56.070 --> 02:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the court would appoint that person if
 
02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
we submitted a list of of one because
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
the language allows for a list of up to
 
02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:01.910 align:start position:0%
the language allows for a list of up to
five

02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
but if we can't agree on one person the
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
other option is to at least agree on a
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
list from which the court would pick
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i know attorney vicinanzo said that
 
02:22:13.270 --> 02:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
they would want to think about that a
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
little more before they give their
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
give their final feedback but that
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
we felt that that was potentially a good
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
way to balance you know the desire to
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
find a qualified person and to have that
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
person be independent
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
to have that person still be a state
 
02:22:30.070 --> 02:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
employee somewhere within the state so
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
that we can control costs which we heard
 
02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about last time so this this is
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
our attempt to balance all of those
 
02:22:36.319 --> 02:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
our attempt to balance all of those
things

02:22:37.910 --> 02:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we we've put it in here so i
 
02:22:41.830 --> 02:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
think it's a good suggestion but that
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
that will ultimately be up to you and
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
i'm sure we'll we'll talk about it
 
02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
further when we've heard tony
 
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
visananzo's feedback
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
so before you leave this bullet um i
 
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
think uh we were asked two things we
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
were asked to make sure that
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh we had an adequate pool of candidates
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
to where we could get this filled and i
 
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
assume you believe that we can do that
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
under this legislation
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
and the second
 
02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
and the second
was

02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
this was going to become a mutually
 
02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive role
 
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
or if the person could maintain an
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
independent practice should they have
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
one have you thought about that second
 
02:23:18.880 --> 02:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
one have you thought about that second
one

02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
what i don't know off the top of my head
 
02:23:26.389 --> 02:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
is if
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
i know we have moonlighting
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
rules for state employees at least in
 
02:23:32.070 --> 02:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
the executive branch that certain
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
full-time employees cannot have other
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
employment outside of their jobs cannot
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily receive compensation for
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
other jobs
 
02:23:42.710 --> 02:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know because we've made this a
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
temporary employee within the judicial
 
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
branch i don't know if they have those
 
02:23:46.469 --> 02:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
same rules
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
from my perspective if whoever the
 
02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
administrator was felt that they could
 
02:23:52.710 --> 02:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
do both
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't have a problem with that even
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
if they're a temporary employee of the
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
judicial branch maintaining a mediation
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
practice on the side but
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a conversation
 
02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.110 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a conversation
between

02:24:05.110 --> 02:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a conversation to
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
be had when we started working to come
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
up with acceptable candidates figuring
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
out who we thought would be workable
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
we'd talk to those folks
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
and if an individual felt that they were
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
interested but would want to maintain a
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
practice on the side and in talking with
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
that person we felt that that could be
 
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
workable we'd agree to have them on the
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
list so i think we could work through
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
that in the selection of the
 
02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:33.349 align:start position:0%
that in the selection of the
administrator

02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative emerit
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
in accounting there's a
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of adage that fixed costs are
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
variable per unit
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
and variable costs are fixed per unit
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here is we're going to
 
02:24:49.110 --> 02:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
establish a fixed cost for
 
02:24:51.429 --> 02:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
administration which during the first
 
02:24:51.439 --> 02:24:52.309 align:start position:0%
administration which during the first
year

02:24:52.309 --> 02:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be a real deal
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
during the second year not quite such a
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
good deal
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
during the third year
 
02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's two cases let's say the first
 
02:25:03.750 --> 02:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
year there's 300 cases fixed cost of
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
salary man amortizes great over 300
 
02:25:06.479 --> 02:25:07.510 align:start position:0%
salary man amortizes great over 300
units

02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
but when you get to year three and
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
you've got two cases and the same fixed
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
cost now those become extraordinarily
 
02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:15.349 align:start position:0%
cost now those become extraordinarily
expensive

02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
my question my thought process is an
 
02:25:20.950 --> 02:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
arbitrator is a variable cost
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
can this part-time employee also be
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
compensated on a variable basis based on
 
02:25:30.469 --> 02:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:32.710 --> 02:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
so we we could set it up that way i mean
 
02:25:35.110 --> 02:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
we we could have the person be
 
02:25:37.349 --> 02:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
say a part-time or an employee within
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
the or a contractor reporting to the
 
02:25:41.750 --> 02:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:43.680 align:start position:0%
who was paid you know on a variable
 
02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
basis say according to the hours they
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
put in
 
02:25:48.790 --> 02:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
i think as i think about it i think
 
02:25:50.309 --> 02:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
you're right you know that this is a
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
better deal maybe in the early years not
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
my sense is is a full-time employee
 
02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:02.550 align:start position:0%
my sense is is a full-time employee
it

02:26:02.550 --> 02:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
it probably comes out in our favor if we
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
have to pay hourly for someone for
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
intense hours even in the first two or
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
three years that's that could be a lot
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
of money so i think we would save in the
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
beginning maybe not save on the back end
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
but it would it would balance out but i
 
02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
do think it would be possible to if if
 
02:26:20.790 --> 02:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
the determination by the committee is
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
you would rather have
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
this person be compensated sort of based
 
02:26:27.590 --> 02:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
on work performed or this person and
 
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
whatever staff they had to utilize have
 
02:26:32.070 --> 02:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
them be compensated based on work
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
performed i think we could set it up
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
that way i i think it's hard to predict
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
what would be an ult better deal for the
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
state financially
 
02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.230 align:start position:0%
state financially
follow-up

02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.190 align:start position:0%
follow-up
yes

02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
now my mine was not the hour of the of
 
02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:45.429 align:start position:0%
now my mine was not the hour of the of
the

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
administrator mine was
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
the case itself
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
the same range could apply a case that
 
02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
the same range could apply a case that
has

02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:26:55.429 --> 02:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm winging it here you know these
 
02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
has more than six variables for example
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
is valued at x
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
one that has two variables is valued at
 
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
0.5 x
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
so that the administrator is paid
 
02:27:09.030 --> 02:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
on a fixed rate
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
based on the complexity of
 
02:27:12.710 --> 02:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
the administration
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
not their hourly rate yep but that would
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
allow you to have multiple
 
02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:18.309 align:start position:0%
allow you to have multiple
administrators

02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
if you have five people and three people
 
02:27:22.710 --> 02:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
three of them are acceptable to
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
everybody you could now have three
 
02:27:24.640 --> 02:27:25.990 align:start position:0%
everybody you could now have three
administrators

02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
on a part-time basis but a fixed
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
compensation schedule so it doesn't turn
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
into a kind of a runaway compensation
 
02:27:33.680 --> 02:27:35.190 align:start position:0%
into a kind of a runaway compensation
plan

02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:27:37.830 --> 02:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
just food for thought i'm okay yeah we
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
can certainly we can we can think about
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you yep
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative walsh
 
02:27:46.870 --> 02:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you um i would actually i just
 
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
have a request of the ag and that is um
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
can you find out if the court rules
 
02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.270 align:start position:0%
can you find out if the court rules
permit

02:27:53.270 --> 02:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
permit
 
02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:54.150 align:start position:0%
permit
uh

02:27:54.150 --> 02:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
what you're envisioning and that is that
 
02:27:58.469 --> 02:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
we might have a mediator who continues
 
02:28:00.550 --> 02:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
to take outside cases as appropriate in
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
their schedule and you know
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
obviously it would be helpful to the
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee to know
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
if this is what's possible under the
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
court rules and if it's not possible
 
02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
under the court rules i'm wondering if
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
we need to add something in here
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the legislation that provides a
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
special exemption to make that possible
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we can absolutely find out
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's anything currently
 
02:28:21.429 --> 02:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
within the court rules or even
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
statutes that apply to the court that
 
02:28:24.790 --> 02:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
would prevent that and then if we
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
decided that that was a good idea we
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
could put language in to
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
to make an exception in this case
 
02:28:29.680 --> 02:28:31.990 align:start position:0%
to make an exception in this case
absolutely

02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:28:36.389 --> 02:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh okay so i now i have one um
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
so representative emmerich kind of
 
02:28:41.510 --> 02:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
brought up a workload issue and i'm just
 
02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:47.270 --> 02:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here about support
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
staff this administrator might need
 
02:28:53.270 --> 02:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
or is there there there is yeah there
 
02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:53.990 align:start position:0%
or is there there there is yeah there
is

02:28:53.990 --> 02:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:28:55.510 --> 02:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
yeah there's permission for the
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
administrator to employ necessary
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
support staff and that or for the
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
i think they would also be temporary
 
02:29:03.270 --> 02:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
employees of the judicial branch as
 
02:29:04.950 --> 02:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
necessary that would be paid out of them
 
02:29:07.110 --> 02:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
so that number can breathe if there's a
 
02:29:09.750 --> 02:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
heavy volume the administrator can go
 
02:29:09.760 --> 02:29:10.710 align:start position:0%
heavy volume the administrator can go
hire

02:29:10.710 --> 02:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
hire
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
people with the right skill set to
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
provide real contribution to helping
 
02:29:18.070 --> 02:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the task yep okay and i think to
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
your point mr chairman that that is an
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
element of this that either even as how
 
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
we've drafted it would provide for some
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
variability so while you have an
 
02:29:28.389 --> 02:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
administrator through the entire period
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
of time right their support staff may
 
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
rise and fall based on workload right i
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
all right so with that i'm going to move
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
to to number two um
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple change i think
 
02:29:51.270 --> 02:29:51.280 align:start position:0%
found on page two lines 11-13
 
02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
we just had some discussion at the last
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
work session about not wanting any part
 
02:29:59.670 --> 02:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
of this to to be taken as
 
02:30:01.590 --> 02:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
expanding or limiting the rights of
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
individuals under
 
02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
under under state law or other parts of
 
02:30:08.230 --> 02:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
state statute or state common law this
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
is meant to be
 
02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
sort of a discrete
 
02:30:11.520 --> 02:30:12.950 align:start position:0%
sort of a discrete
um

02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
let's call it special process for this
 
02:30:17.349 --> 02:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
particular class of
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
of claimants
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it's also not it any definitions in
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
here any concepts in here are not meant
 
02:30:27.349 --> 02:30:27.359 align:start position:0%
to be modifying modifying the common law
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
or changing
 
02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
some concept that may exist somewhere
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go ahead and tag you
 
02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative lynn i i think this was
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
your point last time
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:51.990 --> 02:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry not not completely because i'm
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
still very concerned about
 
02:30:57.750 --> 02:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
the definition of sexual abuse
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
and including this rat this you know
 
02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
removing coercion uh as a as part of the
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
statutory definition because i i'm
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned about
 
02:31:12.070 --> 02:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
what the basis for doing that is and if
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:31:15.590 --> 02:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it's it would seem to me that
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're making
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
in the absence of some other body of law
 
02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
we're making something
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're making a basis for the state to be
 
02:31:26.790 --> 02:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
liable something that
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
is not does not currently provide a
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
basis of liability under the law and
 
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
basis of liability under the law and
that's

02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
that that's what kind of concerns me
 
02:31:37.030 --> 02:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
well so i
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
the case reference state foss i
 
02:31:46.230 --> 02:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
that really gets to whether
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
the coercion requirement in order to to
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
convict of of the crime of
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
of sexual assault the variant of sexual
 
02:31:55.750 --> 02:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
assault that is that um
 
02:31:57.349 --> 02:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
that you have when it when you have a
 
02:31:59.190 --> 02:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
person who has authority or power over
 
02:32:02.710 --> 02:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
an individual using coercion
 
02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
because we've used the criminal code to
 
02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
define what what sexual assault is for
 
02:32:10.790 --> 02:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
purposes of this you know civil claims
 
02:32:13.030 --> 02:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
for which we'd pay damages that's why
 
02:32:14.710 --> 02:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
we're carving that out
 
02:32:19.110 --> 02:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:21.670 --> 02:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
that rem i'm not sure that we're we're
 
02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
removing what the state could be liable
 
02:32:25.510 --> 02:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
for civilly even though someone maybe
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
hasn't committed
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
a crime if you're a corrections officer
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
who couldn't be convicted of a crime for
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
doing something i'm not sure
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't think i'm not aware of
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
cases that have tested that but i'm not
 
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:32:41.670 --> 02:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
in a similar series of events
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
someone has had that interaction with
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the corrections officer
 
02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.710 align:start position:0%
the corrections officer
maybe

02:32:46.710 --> 02:32:46.720 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:32:48.550 --> 02:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
that wasn't a criminal act there may
 
02:32:50.790 --> 02:32:50.800 align:start position:0%
still be
 
02:32:53.510 --> 02:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
based on the facts of that circumstance
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
and ability for someone to bring a civil
 
02:32:57.590 --> 02:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
claim so i i'm not sure we're creating
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
we're necessarily creating new liability
 
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
for the state but that said i think
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with the somewhat
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
different situation here because we're
 
02:33:09.590 --> 02:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with with juveniles and so
 
02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
dealing with with juveniles and so
saying

02:33:10.870 --> 02:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
what we're really trying to say here is
 
02:33:14.950 --> 02:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
that if someone is incarcerated
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
have engaged in sexual acts consensually
 
02:33:20.389 --> 02:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
with a guard
 
02:33:23.429 --> 02:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
the fact that there was no
 
02:33:25.429 --> 02:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
additional coercion other than the fact
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
that the person's incarcerated and the
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
person they've engaged in the acts with
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
as a guard
 
02:33:31.990 --> 02:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
is not a reason to not consider that
 
02:33:33.429 --> 02:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse for purposes of this
 
02:33:33.439 --> 02:33:35.110 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse for purposes of this
statute

02:33:35.110 --> 02:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:33:37.190 --> 02:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
the court at the end of the day in foss
 
02:33:39.270 --> 02:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
was just interpreting what what the
 
02:33:41.429 --> 02:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
state statute meant
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
not that i would say that i think the
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
court got it wrong but i think it would
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
be appropriate for the legislature to
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
say well okay for purposes of this we're
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
gonna we're not gonna go with how you've
 
02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:52.950 align:start position:0%
gonna we're not gonna go with how you've
interpreted

02:33:52.950 --> 02:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
02:33:54.630 --> 02:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
the statute i mean because the
 
02:33:55.830 --> 02:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
legislature could always just make a
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
correction to the statute or change the
 
02:33:59.349 --> 02:33:59.359 align:start position:0%
statute in response to that
 
02:34:01.670 --> 02:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
in response to that that ruling so i
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
know i've kind of gotten not just to
 
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
your question are we creating new
 
02:34:06.309 --> 02:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
liability but also the question that was
 
02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
raised last time of whether this would
 
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
be appropriate
 
02:34:09.510 --> 02:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:10.309 align:start position:0%
all right
matt

02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
matt
 
02:34:13.190 --> 02:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i guess the i guess my
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
concern is that
 
02:34:19.830 --> 02:34:19.840 align:start position:0%
if if you if you were saying to us look
 
02:34:22.389 --> 02:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
there's a well-established body of civil
 
02:34:22.399 --> 02:34:23.270 align:start position:0%
there's a well-established body of civil
law

02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
that says that someone can be held
 
02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:26.630 align:start position:0%
that says that someone can be held
liable

02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
liable
 
02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:27.510 align:start position:0%
liable
for

02:34:27.510 --> 02:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
this kind of sexual assault where
 
02:34:31.830 --> 02:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
where there's no
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
where the requirements of the criminal
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
statute are not met i would have no
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
problem with that but it sounds like we
 
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
we don't really know what the answer to
 
02:34:42.309 --> 02:34:42.319 align:start position:0%
that mean maybe they'll maybe a you know
 
02:34:43.750 --> 02:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
the common law
 
02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
means that and maybe it doesn't and so
 
02:34:47.429 --> 02:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
why would we
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
why would we say anything why wouldn't
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
we just say
 
02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.070 align:start position:0%
you know
um

02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just end the sentence
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
after the citation to the statute and if
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
it turns out that the civil law
 
02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:01.510 align:start position:0%
it turns out that the civil law
of

02:35:01.510 --> 02:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know aggravated of committing
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
aggravated uh
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh sexual assault does not require that
 
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
thing then then fine then you know that
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it does sort of seem like we're
 
02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
i mean it does sort of seem like we're
changing

02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
changing
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're changing the substantive law
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
just for just for sort of this
 
02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:23.910 align:start position:0%
just for just for sort of this
this

02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:35:26.469 --> 02:35:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know these set of of plaintiffs and
 
02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
that does bother me yeah it
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
and i will admit it it is there is a
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
slight discomfort to that
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
i think the reason
 
02:35:38.150 --> 02:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the reason from my perspective that it
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense in this situation
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
although i understand the arguments on
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
the other side is that
 
02:35:45.990 --> 02:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know we've confronted this on the
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
criminal side there are certain acts
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
that that we can't charge for
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
um because of because of foss and
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
because of how the the court has
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
interpreted that statute
 
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily mean on the civil
 
02:36:02.710 --> 02:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
side that that we think those may not be
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
acts that that weren't appropriate that
 
02:36:05.280 --> 02:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
acts that that weren't appropriate that
that

02:36:06.230 --> 02:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:07.590 align:start position:0%
that
could

02:36:07.590 --> 02:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
um could give rise to a potential claim
 
02:36:13.750 --> 02:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
we don't know but they could and since
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
part of this is a settlement mechanism
 
02:36:19.910 --> 02:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
um i think i think there is an argument
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
that it's appropriate here because we're
 
02:36:23.830 --> 02:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
doing other things in this legislation
 
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
that potentially
 
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
will result in payments by the state
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't otherwise have to make
 
02:36:30.950 --> 02:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i i imagine that there will be
 
02:36:33.349 --> 02:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
claimants that come through this process
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
who if we litigated their claims would
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
be barred by limitations i'm almost
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
certain that would be the case and we
 
02:36:41.590 --> 02:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
are setting that aside for purposes of
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
this so this is just one other
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
one other potential defense
 
02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
save that we are
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
setting aside for purposes of this
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
process only
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
jen do you have anything to add to that
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i'm hitting
 
02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:58.070 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure i'm hitting
everything

02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
everything
 
02:36:58.080 --> 02:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
everything
okay

02:36:59.030 --> 02:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
i had a feeling even though i wasn't
 
02:37:01.349 --> 02:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
even looking at her that she had
 
02:37:04.150 --> 02:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
something to happen
 
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
justice lynn
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
i agree with you that the body of civil
 
02:37:10.150 --> 02:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
law that defines the intentional tort of
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
assault is is completely separate from
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
how the criminal law
 
02:37:17.990 --> 02:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
defines um the crime of aggravated
 
02:37:20.389 --> 02:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or simple sexual assault
 
02:37:20.399 --> 02:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
sexual assault or simple sexual assault
um

02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
when we were thinking about the scope of
 
02:37:26.550 --> 02:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation we thought about um how
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
to define the scope and because the
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
civil scope is so much broader and isn't
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
really applicable to activities that
 
02:37:35.510 --> 02:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
happen within a detention facility we
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
opted to use the specific definitions in
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
the criminal code that apply to the
 
02:37:43.590 --> 02:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
juvenile defense detention facility when
 
02:37:45.990 --> 02:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
we looked at doing that we felt that
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
that law was just slightly too narrow
 
02:37:51.750 --> 02:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
in that there is the coercion
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that has been
 
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
interpreted into the statute through the
 
02:37:58.950 --> 02:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
foss case and
 
02:38:02.790 --> 02:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
our understanding of of why that was uh
 
02:38:05.750 --> 02:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the case law was because when you are
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
looking at putting someone
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
into jail for committing the crime of
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
sexual assault um it's important to have
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
the component be that
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's clear that that actor took an
 
02:38:21.349 --> 02:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
intentional act and and that is done
 
02:38:23.190 --> 02:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
through the prosecution having to
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
establish this element of coercion we
 
02:38:27.830 --> 02:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
just felt that that was a little too
 
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
narrow and we wanted to broaden it just
 
02:38:32.710 --> 02:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
a little by removing the coercion
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
element and and that's
 
02:38:38.150 --> 02:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
the reason for the
 
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
the reference to the case law
 
02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
the when we were here last time you
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
expressed a very important concern that
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
that not become
 
02:38:49.429 --> 02:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
somehow engrafted into either the
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
criminal law or the civil law because
 
02:38:54.790 --> 02:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's in this process and so the language
 
02:38:57.349 --> 02:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
that we are proposing is to try to
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
02:39:01.349 --> 02:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
and and i don't know if that explanation
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
helps or not but that's how that wound
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i don't have any i i mean i
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
understand your position i'm still not
 
02:39:14.230 --> 02:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
sure i agree with it but i understand it
 
02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:16.230 align:start position:0%
sure i agree with it but i understand it
okay

02:39:16.230 --> 02:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:17.670 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
so so representative lynn
 
02:39:22.870 --> 02:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
is this an issue that the legislature
 
02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
should take a a different position on
 
02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
than the one being recommended by the ag
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
i guess my my concern is this
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
is that this is going to be a statute in
 
02:39:38.710 --> 02:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
other words i don't
 
02:39:41.429 --> 02:39:41.439 align:start position:0%
i could completely understand that in
 
02:39:44.389 --> 02:39:44.399 align:start position:0%
the context of a particular case
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
the administrator might say you know
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
well this was
 
02:39:48.319 --> 02:39:49.110 align:start position:0%
well this was
the

02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:49.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:49.120 --> 02:39:50.230 align:start position:0%
the
under

02:39:50.230 --> 02:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
under my interpretation of what the of
 
02:39:55.590 --> 02:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
what the civil law would require
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um the the somebody can be someone can
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
be liable and therefore the state should
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to pay uh
 
02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:02.550 align:start position:0%
have to pay uh
pay

02:40:02.550 --> 02:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:40:04.150 --> 02:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh even though there wasn't this
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
particular requirement of state versus
 
02:40:08.950 --> 02:40:08.960 align:start position:0%
foss was met
 
02:40:10.710 --> 02:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
and i but i guess i would think you
 
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
could do that
 
02:40:14.230 --> 02:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
even if you didn't have that reference
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
and to put the to put the reference
 
02:40:18.630 --> 02:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
in a statute
 
02:40:21.590 --> 02:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that in in some sense
 
02:40:23.349 --> 02:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
it you know it the legislature is now
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
sending a message that that this really
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
is what the civil law is
 
02:40:30.630 --> 02:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
for all cases and i don't know that
 
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
that it may that it's appropriate to do
 
02:40:34.389 --> 02:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
that in this kind of
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that that would be my basic
 
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
concern for why you shouldn't do it and
 
02:40:40.870 --> 02:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that you need it i
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
mean i'm really not sure that you
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't accomplish what you want to
 
02:40:46.469 --> 02:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
accomplish without with without saying
 
02:40:46.479 --> 02:40:47.349 align:start position:0%
accomplish without with without saying
that

02:40:47.349 --> 02:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:49.510 --> 02:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
so that that's that's my concern
 
02:40:51.110 --> 02:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay we we can think about it further
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
too and maybe even have an offline
 
02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
conversation okay yeah all right i'm mr
 
02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:56.550 align:start position:0%
conversation okay yeah all right i'm mr
chair

02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:40:58.630 --> 02:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative hatch thank you mr
 
02:40:58.640 --> 02:40:59.349 align:start position:0%
uh representative hatch thank you mr
chair

02:40:59.349 --> 02:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
we often do legislation in that
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
legislation we annotate not with
 
02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:08.080 align:start position:0%
standing certain rsas
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're trying to
 
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
we often do legislation
 
02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:12.710 align:start position:0%
we often do legislation
that

02:41:12.710 --> 02:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:41:16.790 --> 02:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
comply with certain rsas in miso state
 
02:41:19.510 --> 02:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding rsa
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be
 
02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:22.389 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be
and

02:41:22.389 --> 02:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
just if i may and i'm sorry to take the
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
time i need to understand the difference
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
what's happening here
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
with that i think that's kind of what
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying that's
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
this is not totally unique
 
02:41:38.950 --> 02:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.830 --> 02:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
do you understand the point
 
02:41:48.070 --> 02:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
i i do kind of i don't i don't have a
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
coherent response i i don't think uh i
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
agree that it's yeah we do in certain
 
02:41:55.269 --> 02:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
instances say sort of not withstanding
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
any other provision of law or
 
02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.469 align:start position:0%

notwithstanding

x

02:41:59.990 --> 02:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
x
 
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
this will apply for purposes of say this
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas i think this is a
 
02:42:06.230 --> 02:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
little bit different because we're
 
02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:08.389 align:start position:0%
little bit different because we're
referencing

02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
referencing
 
02:42:10.950 --> 02:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
case law which which is not common i
 
02:42:13.429 --> 02:42:13.439 align:start position:0%
have not seen that before so so yeah i
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a similar concept to what
 
02:42:15.830 --> 02:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in other places in the
 
02:42:15.840 --> 02:42:16.950 align:start position:0%
you'll see in other places in the
statute

02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
this is though
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
unique so i think i do have to
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledge to justice lindsard
 
02:42:24.469 --> 02:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative lin's point this is
 
02:42:24.479 --> 02:42:29.030 align:start position:0%
representative lin's point this is
unique

02:42:29.030 --> 02:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're on bullet three
 
02:42:31.680 --> 02:42:33.030 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're on bullet three
yep

02:42:33.030 --> 02:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
so this is uh
 
02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
this is a set of related but but
 
02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat separate points um mostly just
 
02:42:42.710 --> 02:42:42.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure we've got the incentives
 
02:42:45.110 --> 02:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the incentives and and the integrity
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
of the process in the right place
 
02:42:47.439 --> 02:42:48.550 align:start position:0%
of the process in the right place
so

02:42:48.550 --> 02:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:50.790 --> 02:42:50.800 align:start position:0%
the first change on bullet three you'll
 
02:42:52.950 --> 02:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
see in page six lines
 
02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:55.590 align:start position:0%
see in page six lines
through 24-28

02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
and this
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
is in direct response
 
02:43:00.469 --> 02:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
to i'm forgetting who it was it might
 
02:43:01.670 --> 02:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
have been representative emerick as
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
someone else who raised the point that
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
the claimant should know that by moving
 
02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:10.240 align:start position:0%
to the resolution process the cap on
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees goes up
 
02:43:15.190 --> 02:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
and so we just wanted to make clear
 
02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the legislation
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the claimant has to have notice of
 
02:43:20.469 --> 02:43:20.479 align:start position:0%
that that's got to be clear to the
 
02:43:20.479 --> 02:43:24.070 align:start position:0%
that that's got to be clear to the
claimant

02:43:24.070 --> 02:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
this comes from some discussion i think
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
we had at the last work session and some
 
02:43:38.870 --> 02:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up discussion after
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
regarding a concern
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
about the administrator potentially
 
02:43:45.910 --> 02:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
knowing too much about the part the
 
02:43:47.429 --> 02:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the claimant's
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations before the resolution
 
02:43:51.670 --> 02:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
process and that
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
influencing the resolution process
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.429 align:start position:0%
and so
basically

02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:44:00.070 --> 02:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
what we want to make clear is that while
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
the ag designee and the claimant may
 
02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
engage in settlement discussions based
 
02:44:07.190 --> 02:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
on the initial filing of the claim and
 
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
the review
 
02:44:11.190 --> 02:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
that those discussions will not be made
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
known to the administrator if
 
02:44:15.429 --> 02:44:15.439 align:start position:0%
the claimant moves to a resolution
 
02:44:15.439 --> 02:44:16.710 align:start position:0%
the claimant moves to a resolution
process

02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:44:17.910 --> 02:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
basically you don't want to end up with
 
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
a situation where whatever the attorney
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
general offers as a settlement just
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
becomes a floor in every resolution
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
process or that that influences the
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
administrator and i think the claimant
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
you know in order to
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
make put the incentives in the right
 
02:44:34.790 --> 02:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
place the claimant needs to understand
 
02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
that if they go through the resolution
 
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
process they could get less than what
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is offering or more
 
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.150 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is offering or more
but

02:44:42.150 --> 02:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's not guaranteed to be a minimum of
 
02:44:48.309 --> 02:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then the last change here
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
just goes to
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the last draft we wanted to respond
 
02:44:59.670 --> 02:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
to the point that some experts had made
 
02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
which is that it's important for a
 
02:45:03.670 --> 02:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
claimant to have an opportunity to meet
 
02:45:06.550 --> 02:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
face-to-face with the administrator
 
02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
we wanted to give the claimant that
 
02:45:10.070 --> 02:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity but wanted to make clear
 
02:45:11.349 --> 02:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:45:13.349 --> 02:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
that type of meeting alone
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
would not
 
02:45:17.429 --> 02:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
result in in
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
the cap the cap going up on attorney's
 
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
fees it's not necessarily that's not
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean they're necessarily
 
02:45:24.469 --> 02:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
going to the resolution process they
 
02:45:26.309 --> 02:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
just may feel like they want to be able
 
02:45:30.150 --> 02:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
to say to the administrator that that
 
02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
talk about what happened to them
 
02:45:33.510 --> 02:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
um tell their story
 
02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
so so is this the is this the best
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
section of your summary for us to uh
 
02:45:43.349 --> 02:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
go off on the the side track of
 
02:45:46.630 --> 02:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
the uh the the observation that was made
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
saying that we need we we ought to let
 
02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
the claimant get further in the process
 
02:45:57.750 --> 02:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
and get to know the dollar amount before
 
02:45:57.760 --> 02:45:59.110 align:start position:0%
and get to know the dollar amount before
they

02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
realize that they've
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're now locked in
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
is this the right time to talk about
 
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
that i think so i think this would be a
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
the change that we made
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
in this draft it's actually a point
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
further down but given how the
 
02:46:16.790 --> 02:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
discussion flowed with attorney
 
02:46:18.309 --> 02:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
visananzo i think this is a good place
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
to talk about it
 
02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:21.930 align:start position:0%
we made a change in this draft to
 
02:46:21.930 --> 02:46:23.670 align:start position:0%
we made a change in this draft to
[Music]

02:46:23.670 --> 02:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
to move the point at which a claimant
 
02:46:28.309 --> 02:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
has to waive their right to go to court
 
02:46:31.110 --> 02:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
from when they file a claim
 
02:46:33.830 --> 02:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
to after they've had discussions with
 
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general designee
 
02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
and they decide to go to the resolution
 
02:46:42.150 --> 02:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
process so the idea being that
 
02:46:44.469 --> 02:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
you file your claim
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
the language attorney visananza was
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
referring to that he thought wasn't
 
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
clear is on page five
 
02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
line three
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
where it says by filing a claim a
 
02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
claimant waives their right to
 
02:46:58.710 --> 02:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
simultaneously seek relief in court
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
what that is intended to accomplish is
 
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
to say if you file a claim
 
02:47:04.710 --> 02:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're not giving up your right to go to
 
02:47:07.030 --> 02:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
court but you are essentially agreeing
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
to stay any
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that you filed while you go
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
through this process so that we avoid a
 
02:47:15.429 --> 02:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
now you're going through the process set
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
up by this bill you're litigating at the
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
same time
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
that doesn't just create a resource
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
problem i think it also creates
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
practical problems because we might be
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
engaging in discovery over here taking
 
02:47:30.469 --> 02:47:30.479 align:start position:0%
depositions trading information and then
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're going through a separate process
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
at the same time it's just not it
 
02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's not i think uh the ideal situation
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
it creates a number of problems so so i
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
think i get the simultaneous issue yep
 
02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:43.750 align:start position:0%
think i get the simultaneous issue yep
um

02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
the the the other part of what was being
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
said though and just because it's simple
 
02:47:51.030 --> 02:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
to me is that
 
02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um they ought to the claimant ought to
 
02:47:56.150 --> 02:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
know what the state is offering in a
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
dollar amount yep
 
02:48:00.630 --> 02:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
before they lose their right to go back
 
02:48:01.910 --> 02:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
to court
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
what what are your thoughts on the
 
02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
timing of that
 
02:48:07.030 --> 02:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
so my general thoughts on that are this
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not
 
02:48:12.150 --> 02:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
a couple points one high level i think
 
02:48:13.750 --> 02:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
the point was made and i think it's a
 
02:48:15.429 --> 02:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
good one if
 
02:48:19.269 --> 02:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
if we do that it removes i think
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
much of the purpose of this legislation
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
because all we've done is is
 
02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
set up a much more complicated
 
02:48:28.469 --> 02:48:28.479 align:start position:0%
mediation process than we would undergo
 
02:48:31.110 --> 02:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
if we just tried to mediate this
 
02:48:31.120 --> 02:48:32.710 align:start position:0%
if we just tried to mediate this
so

02:48:32.710 --> 02:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:34.230 --> 02:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
it removes the purpose of the
 
02:48:35.359 --> 02:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
it removes the purpose of the
legislation

02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:38.469 align:start position:0%
legislation
overall

02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
overall
 
02:48:41.510 --> 02:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
i also would say it's not the the
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
concept of
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
going through
 
02:48:47.429 --> 02:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
an arbitration process as a exclusive
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
alternative to go to court
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:48:53.429 --> 02:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
an uncommon or or
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
strange concept i mean
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
this process is intended to be if you
 
02:49:00.870 --> 02:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
elect the resolution process it's
 
02:49:02.469 --> 02:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
intended to be
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
a kinder gentler simpler process by
 
02:49:08.230 --> 02:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
which you are more likely to get
 
02:49:08.240 --> 02:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
which you are more likely to get
something

02:49:09.750 --> 02:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day maybe less than if
 
02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
you went to court but that's the
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
alternative you're electing
 
02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's not it's meant to be an alternative
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
option it's not meant to be a
 
02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:21.190 align:start position:0%
option it's not meant to be a
pre-litigation

02:49:21.190 --> 02:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
pre-litigation
 
02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
mediation so
 
02:49:25.429 --> 02:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
while i understand that
 
02:49:27.830 --> 02:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
getting to wait and see what your reward
 
02:49:29.349 --> 02:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
is before you have to waive your rights
 
02:49:30.630 --> 02:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
to go to court
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
02:49:35.349 --> 02:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
certainly positive for a claimant i
 
02:49:37.590 --> 02:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
think it
 
02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:38.830 align:start position:0%
think it
it

02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
it we've talked a lot about balance in
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
this trying to balance the rights of the
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
claimant balance our obligations to the
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers balance the desire to provide
 
02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:50.309 align:start position:0%
taxpayers balance the desire to provide
a

02:49:50.309 --> 02:49:50.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
kinder gentler process while also
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
providing fair compensation i think
 
02:49:54.950 --> 02:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're getting a little bit out of
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
balance if we
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
if we
 
02:50:01.030 --> 02:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
if we do that
 
02:50:03.030 --> 02:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative lynn yes you know and i
 
02:50:04.950 --> 02:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
apologize mr chair i
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
i no
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm honored to apologies
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
you here well no i just i have an issue
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
about an earlier point that that was
 
02:50:15.190 --> 02:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
made about um
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned and i think it's a very
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
good very good you know way that you've
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
drafted this on page six at the bottom
 
02:50:23.269 --> 02:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh you note that the a.g and the
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
claimant may engage in discussions
 
02:50:25.680 --> 02:50:26.870 align:start position:0%
claimant may engage in discussions
um

02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:26.880 --> 02:50:27.910 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:30.790 --> 02:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that do not where the administ that
 
02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
which they don't tell the administrator
 
02:50:34.309 --> 02:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
about but the thing i'm concerned about
 
02:50:34.319 --> 02:50:35.349 align:start position:0%
about but the thing i'm concerned about
is

02:50:35.349 --> 02:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
on page if you go back to page five in
 
02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:39.439 align:start position:0%
line see
 
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
in section
 
02:50:42.630 --> 02:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
eight c
 
02:50:44.950 --> 02:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
it says um
 
02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
once a claim is considered complete the
 
02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
a.g designee will have 30 days to
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
indicate to the claimant and the and the
 
02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.309 align:start position:0%
indicate to the claimant and the and the
administrator

02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
02:50:55.030 --> 02:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
its position regarding the claim and so
 
02:50:57.030 --> 02:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned that
 
02:50:58.389 --> 02:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
that may be
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
in other words does that
 
02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:00.710 align:start position:0%
in other words does that
what

02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:51:02.469 --> 02:51:02.479 align:start position:0%
what is what is envisioned by that and
 
02:51:05.269 --> 02:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
then also in in subsection d on the next
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
page it says following receipt
 
02:51:09.590 --> 02:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the ag's position and i'm just
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
wondering i mean
 
02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
that would tend to suggest unless there
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
was some different language that would
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
tend to suggest
 
02:51:18.469 --> 02:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
that the administrator is going to be
 
02:51:20.389 --> 02:51:20.399 align:start position:0%
aware of what
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
you know of what the ag sort of thinks
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
about the case and which would be
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
which may be inconsistent with the with
 
02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
the administrator not knowing that yep
 
02:51:31.269 --> 02:51:31.279 align:start position:0%
so i think and i'm gonna i'm gonna let
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
jen jump in on this too after i finish
 
02:51:34.630 --> 02:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
because she and i talked extensively
 
02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
about this but
 
02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:37.110 align:start position:0%
about this but
there

02:51:37.110 --> 02:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general wanting to the
 
02:51:45.030 --> 02:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
claim is gonna set out what happened
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
how much of the guidelines they think
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's worth
 
02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:49.590 align:start position:0%
that's worth
and

02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has the opportunity
 
02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
to look at that and give a position i
 
02:51:53.600 --> 02:51:54.550 align:start position:0%
to look at that and give a position i
think

02:51:54.550 --> 02:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:51:55.750 --> 02:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction between the
 
02:51:57.830 --> 02:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general maybe saying
 
02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes there's sufficient evidence that
 
02:52:01.349 --> 02:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
this hat we believe also there's say
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence that this happened
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
or at least nothing to indicate this
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
didn't happen for
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
um let's say
 
02:52:11.990 --> 02:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
allegation one through three
 
02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:14.319 align:start position:0%
not sure there's sufficient evidence
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
that allegations four through five
 
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
there's something that would call into
 
02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
question allegations four through five
 
02:52:20.230 --> 02:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
part of the complaint
 
02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
we would want the administrator to have
 
02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:23.910 align:start position:0%
we would want the administrator to have
that

02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:25.830 align:start position:0%
that
because

02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's important for the administrator to
 
02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
have kind of the general view
 
02:52:30.550 --> 02:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
of the attorney general's general view
 
02:52:32.469 --> 02:52:32.479 align:start position:0%
of the claim
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that the attorney
 
02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
general designee and the claimant might
 
02:52:36.950 --> 02:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
not then
 
02:52:39.110 --> 02:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
as part of that conversation say okay
 
02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:40.070 align:start position:0%
as part of that conversation say okay
well

02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:52:41.670 --> 02:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
we have real questions about this you've
 
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
said x we've got questions about why
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
while we might be inclined to say
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
this to the administrator we would offer
 
02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:52.230 align:start position:0%
this to the administrator we would offer
you

02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:52:54.790 --> 02:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
an amount of money to to settle the case
 
02:52:56.150 --> 02:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that's what we don't want
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
the administrator to have okay no i i i
 
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
see i i appreciate your clarification
 
02:53:03.670 --> 02:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i understand what you're saying okay
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
how'd i do
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything to add to that
 
02:53:17.750 --> 02:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
specifically the only other thing i
 
02:53:20.309 --> 02:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
would add is that i think this also goes
 
02:53:23.429 --> 02:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
to the plaintiff's council's concern
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
plaintiff needs to understand the
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
state's position before it exercises the
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
waiver by having the attorney general's
 
02:53:33.990 --> 02:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
designee weigh in on which parts of the
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
claim analogous to an answer in
 
02:53:38.950 --> 02:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
litigation which parts of the of the of
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
the claim the attorney general believes
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
should be paid that that is the state's
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind of first offer
 
02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
02:53:49.990 --> 02:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
claimant would be asked to make the
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
choice whether based on that offer they
 
02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to now leave the process and go to
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
litigation or that whether they want to
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
move forward through the resolution
 
02:54:00.150 --> 02:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
process with the administrator
 
02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
that the decision
 
02:54:03.670 --> 02:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
at that point would be between two
 
02:54:05.349 --> 02:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
different processes
 
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't like the state's offer but
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
they would have the information that i
 
02:54:10.630 --> 02:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
think council is looking for
 
02:54:12.870 --> 02:54:12.880 align:start position:0%
for that to be an informed decision
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
mr may i
 
02:54:16.790 --> 02:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
just follow up with one point
 
02:54:18.630 --> 02:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know i'm just wondering and again i
 
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
i understand what what you've said and
 
02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
that may that may the way you have it
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
may be fine given what you've said but
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
 
02:54:26.640 --> 02:54:27.910 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering
if

02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:28.710 align:start position:0%
if
if

02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:54:30.550 --> 02:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be able to accomplish what
 
02:54:33.429 --> 02:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
you want to accomplish
 
02:54:33.439 --> 02:54:34.469 align:start position:0%
you want to accomplish
without

02:54:34.469 --> 02:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
without getting
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
the administrative without giving the
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
administrator knowledge that might you
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
know sort of
 
02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
intentionally or unintentionally cause
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
them to cabin in what the value is going
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
to be if in section c
 
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
you simply said um
 
02:54:52.550 --> 02:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
the ag will have uh
 
02:54:54.469 --> 02:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
30 days to indicate
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
right now it says to to claim it and the
 
02:54:58.550 --> 02:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
administrator what if you just said
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have 30 days to
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
uh to indicate to claim it
 
02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh its position regarding the claim and
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
then in d
 
02:55:07.750 --> 02:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you said
 
02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know following um
 
02:55:10.319 --> 02:55:12.070 align:start position:0%
you know following um
uh

02:55:12.070 --> 02:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
receipt by the administrator
 
02:55:18.950 --> 02:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
of uh an indication that the ag has has
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
informed the claimant of its position
 
02:55:24.309 --> 02:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
you know then certain things will happen
 
02:55:26.309 --> 02:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
that way the the administrator wouldn't
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
have the information
 
02:55:31.030 --> 02:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
really at you know sort of at all about
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
what the ag's position is until
 
02:55:36.550 --> 02:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
after the you know you you you and the
 
02:55:39.030 --> 02:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
the the the ag's designee and the admin
 
02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the uh claimant have not been able
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
to come to an agreement then you would
 
02:55:43.359 --> 02:55:44.389 align:start position:0%
to come to an agreement then you would
provide

02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:55:46.230 --> 02:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
then you'd go to the administrator to
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
have the administrator resolve it
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:51.120 --> 02:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
just

02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
we certainly could structure it that way
 
02:55:57.030 --> 02:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
but i think as a practical matter as
 
02:55:59.910 --> 02:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:01.590 --> 02:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
as soon as
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
the claimant were to make the election
 
02:56:05.349 --> 02:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
to go to the administrator we would
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
still want to then provide the
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
administrator with our position anyway
 
02:56:12.070 --> 02:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
as a starting point for moving forward i
 
02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't envision that the ag designee
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
would ever back off of a position going
 
02:56:18.309 --> 02:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
into a resolution proceeding that they
 
02:56:19.990 --> 02:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
had told the claimant
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
was what they would resolve the claim
 
02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
for what they thought it was worth okay
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh all right
 
02:56:30.469 --> 02:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
so i i just want to let you know you're
 
02:56:33.030 --> 02:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
not doing very well managing your 45
 
02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:36.469 align:start position:0%
not doing very well managing your 45
minutes

02:56:36.469 --> 02:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:38.150 --> 02:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
all right let's see if we can make up
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
time all right
 
02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:42.469 align:start position:0%
time all right
yeah

02:56:42.469 --> 02:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:56:44.710 --> 02:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
um so moving to number four
 
02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh further clarification and improvement
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
regarding installment payments
 
02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.399 align:start position:0%
we've discussed this a little bit and mr
 
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
early discussed this a little bit but
 
02:56:56.309 --> 02:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
after having uh consulted with with um
 
02:56:57.510 --> 02:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
with some folks that i think it was
 
02:56:59.110 --> 02:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
representative walt suggest we consult
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
with we thought it was a good idea
 
02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
um coming out of the discussion last
 
02:57:06.150 --> 02:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
time when we talked about the option for
 
02:57:08.469 --> 02:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
a claimant to take their
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
take any award in installment payments
 
02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
to add a third option we started with
 
02:57:16.630 --> 02:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
two options one was lump sum one was the
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
state pays out the claim in installment
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
payments of up to 10 years
 
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
we added a third option which is
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
the claimant can essentially elect that
 
02:57:29.510 --> 02:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
their let's just call 250 000 award be
 
02:57:31.990 --> 02:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
used to purchase an annuity from a
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
company and so it'll be that company
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
that they purchased it from that pays
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
out the claim that also gives more
 
02:57:40.469 --> 02:57:40.479 align:start position:0%
flexibility that that annuity could not
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
might not be ten years it might be more
 
02:57:44.790 --> 02:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
but it it's an additional option for the
 
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
claimant that doesn't really change the
 
02:57:48.870 --> 02:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
hit to the state because it's not really
 
02:57:50.790 --> 02:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
any different than the state paying it
 
02:57:52.710 --> 02:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
all in a lump sum to the claimant in
 
02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
this case the claimant's using that lump
 
02:57:54.800 --> 02:57:56.070 align:start position:0%
this case the claimant's using that lump
sum

02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
sum
 
02:57:57.830 --> 02:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
to structure something with a third
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
party that
 
02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
provides a little more flexibility
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
so does the state end up making a
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation on on which settlement
 
02:58:08.469 --> 02:58:08.479 align:start position:0%
route they go or or who they might use
 
02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
if they want a structured settlement it
 
02:58:12.710 --> 02:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
we do provide in here that the the
 
02:58:15.750 --> 02:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
administrator will maintain a list of
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
of companies you could use for this
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
purpose right but we have removed the
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
provision based on concern we had last
 
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
time that the administrator could impose
 
02:58:26.070 --> 02:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
installment payments over the claimant's
 
02:58:28.230 --> 02:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
injection and so is that list off of
 
02:58:28.240 --> 02:58:29.990 align:start position:0%
injection and so is that list off of
some

02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:31.429 align:start position:0%
some
vendor

02:58:31.429 --> 02:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
02:58:35.510 --> 02:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
list that already exists or or is there
 
02:58:37.590 --> 02:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
do you imagine a process of where you
 
02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:38.469 align:start position:0%
do you imagine a process of where you
would

02:58:38.469 --> 02:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:58:41.510 --> 02:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
bar somebody from being on that list
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think it it discretioned the
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
administrator the language says the
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
administrator may maintain that list i
 
02:58:48.150 --> 02:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
think it would be up to the
 
02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
administrator in consultation with
 
02:58:52.070 --> 02:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
whoever they think is appropriate to to
 
02:58:54.309 --> 02:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
have a list of recommendations certainly
 
02:58:56.790 --> 02:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that the the claimant has
 
02:58:59.190 --> 02:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
to take someone from that list just it
 
02:59:04.389 --> 02:59:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:07.110 --> 02:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
so number five i know we've already had
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
some discussion on this but this change
 
02:59:10.389 --> 02:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
came out
 
02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the discussion at the last work
 
02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:13.429 align:start position:0%
of the discussion at the last work
session

02:59:13.429 --> 02:59:13.439 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:59:15.910 --> 02:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
regarding how important these guidelines
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
are going to be
 
02:59:21.910 --> 02:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:23.510 --> 02:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
we've added provisions that would
 
02:59:25.590 --> 02:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
provide that after
 
02:59:28.150 --> 02:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and claimants
 
02:59:28.160 --> 02:59:29.190 align:start position:0%
the attorney general and claimants
counsel

02:59:29.190 --> 02:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:59:31.910 --> 02:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
meet to figure out what the claims
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
process and guidelines will look like
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
that that has to be approved by the
 
02:59:37.750 --> 02:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:59:41.510 --> 02:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
the reason for that i think is that
 
02:59:43.030 --> 02:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
the guidelines
 
02:59:44.309 --> 02:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
however they look are going to be very
 
02:59:46.469 --> 02:59:46.479 align:start position:0%
important in determining how how and
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
where claims land between zero dollars
 
02:59:51.510 --> 02:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
and whatever the cap is
 
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
the guidelines are going to be very
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
important in determining really at the
 
02:59:56.710 --> 02:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
end of the day how much money
 
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
may go out the door and so i think there
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
i detected last time a discomfort from
 
03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
this committee with just delegating that
 
03:00:06.950 --> 03:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
out to the attorney general and
 
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
claimants council and having it never
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
come back before before elected
 
03:00:13.830 --> 03:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
representatives and so the idea here is
 
03:00:13.840 --> 03:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
representatives and so the idea here is
that

03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:00:16.230 --> 03:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
claimants counsel
 
03:00:17.910 --> 03:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
would meet
 
03:00:21.830 --> 03:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
and agree on on a set of process and
 
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines that would be presented to
 
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and the fiscal
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
committee could either approve or the
 
03:00:29.269 --> 03:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee could object and
 
03:00:32.070 --> 03:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
articulate concerns which would require
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
claimants counts on the attorney general
 
03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
to bring back a revised proposal
 
03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
03:00:39.910 --> 03:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that that is was our attempt to
 
03:00:39.920 --> 03:00:40.870 align:start position:0%
so that that is was our attempt to
address

03:00:40.870 --> 03:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think what was a desire to have
 
03:00:45.830 --> 03:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
have a last check
 
03:00:48.469 --> 03:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
by by legislative representatives
 
03:00:51.110 --> 03:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
on these guidelines i understand and i
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
think at this point i'll address
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
attorney visananzo's concern i
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
understand the concern that
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
that provides sort of another point at
 
03:00:59.990 --> 03:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
which there could be disagreement or the
 
03:01:02.230 --> 03:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
process could go off the rails
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think we have to balance that concern
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
with the competing
 
03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh consideration that to the point you
 
03:01:10.309 --> 03:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
made representative edwards this is
 
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
 
03:01:11.840 --> 03:01:12.790 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money
and

03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know with without some form of
 
03:01:17.030 --> 03:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
approval of these guidelines there's a
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
lot of delegation being given
 
03:01:19.359 --> 03:01:20.870 align:start position:0%
lot of delegation being given
to

03:01:20.870 --> 03:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:22.550 --> 03:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
to determine how much money is going out
 
03:01:24.230 --> 03:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
the door to just the attorney general
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
and claimant's counsel so i think this
 
03:01:28.389 --> 03:01:28.399 align:start position:0%
is ultimately a determination for for
 
03:01:30.309 --> 03:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
this committee given that you are the
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
legislature so you can represent the
 
03:01:35.030 --> 03:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislature's interests i generally
 
03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
think that's a good idea i mean it's
 
03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
something we would recommend
 
03:01:39.750 --> 03:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
but it
 
03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
again you know like all of this it's a
 
03:01:42.870 --> 03:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
determination you have to make in
 
03:01:45.190 --> 03:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
balancing those considerations
 
03:01:47.510 --> 03:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
i i have confidence that we could work
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
with claimants counsel to come up with
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
something and then make a very good
 
03:01:53.429 --> 03:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
presentation to the fiscal committee
 
03:01:55.670 --> 03:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
so i don't have the same consternation
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
over the process as attorney visanzo
 
03:01:57.439 --> 03:01:58.150 align:start position:0%
over the process as attorney visanzo
does

03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
does
 
03:02:00.309 --> 03:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
representative walsh thank you mr
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
chairman uh mr attorney general are you
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
aware of any other time in the state
 
03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
where the legislature weighs in
 
03:02:09.910 --> 03:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the settlement terms of a civil
 
03:02:12.150 --> 03:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
action involving the state i mean this
 
03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:13.030 align:start position:0%
action involving the state i mean this
i've

03:02:13.030 --> 03:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
i've
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
been here 14 years but i am unaware of
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
anything but that certainly there's a
 
03:02:18.870 --> 03:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
lot of things i don't know and i'm
 
03:02:21.030 --> 03:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is a unique animal or
 
03:02:22.469 --> 03:02:22.479 align:start position:0%
if there's another occasion where the
 
03:02:24.309 --> 03:02:24.319 align:start position:0%
legislature gets a say in those kinds of
 
03:02:24.319 --> 03:02:25.190 align:start position:0%
legislature gets a say in those kinds of
things

03:02:25.190 --> 03:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
yeah great question thank you
 
03:02:30.309 --> 03:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative so the concept is not
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
foreign because i i think it's rsa 1435
 
03:02:36.070 --> 03:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
forgetting exactly the citation
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
provides a 1435 e for any settlement
 
03:02:42.309 --> 03:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
over i think it's one quarter of one
 
03:02:42.319 --> 03:02:43.429 align:start position:0%
over i think it's one quarter of one
percent

03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:02:46.070 --> 03:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
of of the last fiscal year's total
 
03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:47.349 align:start position:0%
of of the last fiscal year's total
revenue

03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the legislature would have to
 
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
approve that settlement i think that
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
number is around 4.6 million dollars
 
03:02:52.800 --> 03:02:53.910 align:start position:0%
number is around 4.6 million dollars
so

03:02:53.910 --> 03:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:02:55.910 --> 03:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
let's take a separate case from this i
 
03:02:58.710 --> 03:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
could not go out and settle a case
 
03:03:01.269 --> 03:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
with another claimant for something else
 
03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
for five million dollars without having
 
03:03:06.389 --> 03:03:06.399 align:start position:0%
it be approved by the full legislature
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
but through through an actual act of
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so this concept is somewhat
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
similar to that given how much money
 
03:03:16.230 --> 03:03:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here but we would
 
03:03:17.750 --> 03:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
this would be a simpler approval
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
mechanism because it would just be the
 
03:03:21.269 --> 03:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee as opposed to bringing
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
this back these guidelines back as a
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
bill now this is a little different
 
03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:26.710 align:start position:0%
bill now this is a little different
because

03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:03:28.230 --> 03:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
in this case the fiscal committee would
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
not be approving say just a dollar
 
03:03:32.389 --> 03:03:32.399 align:start position:0%
amount or terms the fiscal committee
 
03:03:34.389 --> 03:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
would be approving
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a piece of this settlement
 
03:03:39.429 --> 03:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
process but i think while it's a little
 
03:03:41.349 --> 03:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
bit different it's a concept that the
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has contemplated before
 
03:03:46.630 --> 03:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
because that's built into 1435e
 
03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:49.030 align:start position:0%
because that's built into 1435e
yep

03:03:49.030 --> 03:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:50.790 --> 03:03:50.800 align:start position:0%
could you while we're talking many could
 
03:03:53.830 --> 03:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
you address um another couple of points
 
03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh one is uh there's concern that for uh
 
03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
physical abuse only 150 cap would be uh
 
03:04:04.230 --> 03:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily low
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
if you could address that um and then
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
given that we since we've last met we we
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
have expanded the scope a little bit of
 
03:04:15.910 --> 03:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
what we're going to cover
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm just curious if it's your
 
03:04:21.750 --> 03:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
position that 100 million is going to be
 
03:04:21.760 --> 03:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
position that 100 million is going to be
adequate

03:04:26.950 --> 03:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for that so i i think
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think there's a couple different
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
points in there so the first one i'm
 
03:04:35.110 --> 03:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
going to take is
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
expanding this to include physical abuse
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
claims and so i'm going to skip ahead to
 
03:04:42.550 --> 03:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
a bullet that's on our list
 
03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:45.349 align:start position:0%
a bullet that's on our list
we

03:04:45.349 --> 03:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:46.950 --> 03:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
over the course of these discussions i
 
03:04:48.389 --> 03:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
think we've talked a lot about that
 
03:04:50.309 --> 03:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
whether this should just be this should
 
03:04:51.830 --> 03:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
just cover sexual abuse claims or
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether it should be broadened to
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
include physical abuse claims
 
03:04:57.030 --> 03:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
i think as we've thought about it we've
 
03:04:58.790 --> 03:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
really wrestled with it as you know my
 
03:05:00.230 --> 03:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
position has been that this should just
 
03:05:02.070 --> 03:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
cover sexual abuse claims given the
 
03:05:06.230 --> 03:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
physical abuse claims whether there
 
03:05:08.950 --> 03:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
might have been a reason for those
 
03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
claims then the need to see records to
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
determine whether those claims happened
 
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
i think or whether the events
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
that underlie those claims happen
 
03:05:20.790 --> 03:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think as we've thought about it
 
03:05:21.830 --> 03:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
we can
 
03:05:24.309 --> 03:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
resolve those the concerns with the
 
03:05:26.469 --> 03:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
difficulty of verifying physical abuse
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
claims and the difficulty of parsing
 
03:05:31.190 --> 03:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
through potential defenses by including
 
03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
them within what's covered here
 
03:05:36.550 --> 03:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
but accounting for the potential
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties and verifying them with a
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
lower cap on what we'd pay out
 
03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's all about i think balancing what i
 
03:05:46.710 --> 03:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
what i see as a desire on the part of
 
03:05:49.269 --> 03:05:49.279 align:start position:0%
the state and on the legislature to
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
compensate claimants for harm they've
 
03:05:54.630 --> 03:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
suffered but balance that with verifying
 
03:05:54.640 --> 03:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
suffered but balance that with verifying
whether

03:05:56.150 --> 03:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
whether
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
alleged acts have occurred and also
 
03:06:01.510 --> 03:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
accounting for what the state's exposure
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be if we went to court because at
 
03:06:05.030 --> 03:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the day this is taxpayer
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
money and so we
 
03:06:11.590 --> 03:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
i would struggle with the idea of paying
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
paying an amount for claims it's a lot
 
03:06:14.550 --> 03:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
more when they're worth
 
03:06:17.110 --> 03:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
so that in trying to balance all of that
 
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think we feel that including physical
 
03:06:21.510 --> 03:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
abuse claims in the scope of this but
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
with a lower cap
 
03:06:27.429 --> 03:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
is a good place to balance that
 
03:06:29.590 --> 03:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
the second point well
 
03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
and it's also the case that
 
03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
if um if there's a claimant that
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
believes the 150
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
k cap is too low
 
03:06:41.510 --> 03:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
they have the ordinary processes that
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
they can leverage yes if a claimant
 
03:06:46.150 --> 03:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
believes that that cap is too low they
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
can they can go to court um i want to
 
03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:50.389 align:start position:0%
can they can go to court um i want to
address

03:06:50.389 --> 03:06:50.399 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:06:52.309 --> 03:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
a point that that came up in the earlier
 
03:06:54.150 --> 03:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
discussion which was the caps themselves
 
03:06:57.750 --> 03:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
150 000 and i think 1.5 million
 
03:07:00.070 --> 03:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
and they were described as arbitrary
 
03:07:01.910 --> 03:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
i just want to respectfully disagree
 
03:07:04.230 --> 03:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
with that i think as we have
 
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
stated in past work sessions we we've
 
03:07:06.640 --> 03:07:07.590 align:start position:0%
stated in past work sessions we we've
done

03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:07:10.230 --> 03:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of verdict research to come up to
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
first come up with the 1.5 million
 
03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
dollar cap we've provided that to this
 
03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
dollar cap we've provided that to this
committee

03:07:15.670 --> 03:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:07:17.910 --> 03:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
we think based on those numbers 1.5
 
03:07:20.469 --> 03:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
million is important because or is is
 
03:07:23.349 --> 03:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate because with that cap
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
this process
 
03:07:26.630 --> 03:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
can be designed in a way where the
 
03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
claims that are paid out
 
03:07:30.389 --> 03:07:30.399 align:start position:0%
sort of fit roughly with the national
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
average these types of cases
 
03:07:34.469 --> 03:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
the hundred and fifty thousand dollar
 
03:07:34.479 --> 03:07:35.910 align:start position:0%
the hundred and fifty thousand dollar
cap

03:07:35.910 --> 03:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
cap
 
03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
is based on looking at physical abuse
 
03:07:39.990 --> 03:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
claims within the verdict research we've
 
03:07:43.269 --> 03:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.750 --> 03:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
the rough average there
 
03:07:49.030 --> 03:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's lower i think it falls
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
60 between 65 000 and 75 000 and so
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's how we determined a 150 000 cap
 
03:07:58.950 --> 03:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
so while i would fully acknowledge that
 
03:08:00.870 --> 03:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
someone may disagree with the research
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
we've done or think other cases should
 
03:08:04.630 --> 03:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
be included in that research
 
03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
i i do not think it's fair to describe
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
those caps as arbitrary i think they're
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
based on verdict research the other
 
03:08:13.510 --> 03:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
point i want to address is this
 
03:08:16.230 --> 03:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
there was a reference to other caps that
 
03:08:19.190 --> 03:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature has already established
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
the cat the cap in 4 14 35 e
 
03:08:24.790 --> 03:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
and the cap in
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm forgetting the sight but the 325 000
 
03:08:27.520 --> 03:08:28.550 align:start position:0%
i'm forgetting the sight but the 325 000
cap

03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
cap
 
03:08:31.830 --> 03:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
um i think it's in 541.
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
the 1435 ecap
 
03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
is a settlement authority cap that is
 
03:08:39.750 --> 03:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
meant to limit what the attorney general
 
03:08:42.150 --> 03:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
can do with regard to settling cases
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
without coming back to the legislature
 
03:08:45.110 --> 03:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
for approval
 
03:08:47.910 --> 03:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
based on the formula that's about 4.6
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
million dollars so i think that that cap
 
03:08:53.269 --> 03:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
is not the same as the type of cap we're
 
03:08:54.950 --> 03:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
03:08:56.469 --> 03:08:56.479 align:start position:0%
which is or the type of caps we're
 
03:08:58.710 --> 03:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
talking about here which are caps that
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
we've determined based on what we think
 
03:09:03.910 --> 03:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be fair amounts given
 
03:09:05.670 --> 03:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
what these types of cases have settled
 
03:09:07.510 --> 03:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
for in the past
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
the 325 thousand dollar cap
 
03:09:13.349 --> 03:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's also not a a
 
03:09:15.670 --> 03:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
cap that's meant to to value a
 
03:09:17.349 --> 03:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
particular claim
 
03:09:19.110 --> 03:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
that is what i'll describe as a
 
03:09:21.190 --> 03:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
sovereign immunity cap it basically says
 
03:09:23.590 --> 03:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the state is only
 
03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
um that you can only get up to 325
 
03:09:28.150 --> 03:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
03:09:30.630 --> 03:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
per incident for for various claims
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
against the state
 
03:09:34.389 --> 03:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
but that that's a general
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
cap for that could cover anything
 
03:09:37.680 --> 03:09:38.710 align:start position:0%
cap for that could cover anything
it

03:09:38.710 --> 03:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:09:40.550 --> 03:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
it's not the same as the type of cap
 
03:09:42.150 --> 03:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
again we're talking about here which is
 
03:09:44.229 --> 03:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
for a specific type of claim that we've
 
03:09:47.429 --> 03:09:47.439 align:start position:0%
been able to do research on so i think
 
03:09:48.870 --> 03:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
03:09:51.750 --> 03:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
while i i understand that claimant's
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
counsel may think that 150 000 is too
 
03:09:59.110 --> 03:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
low and 1.5 million dollars is too low
 
03:10:01.429 --> 03:10:01.439 align:start position:0%
i would submit to you that what we would
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
need to see to determine to assess that
 
03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:06.309 align:start position:0%
need to see to determine to assess that
is

03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:10:08.550 --> 03:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
other research or additional research
 
03:10:10.389 --> 03:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
regarding what types of payouts have
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
happened in these types of cases
 
03:10:14.150 --> 03:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think the numbers we should be
 
03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
looking to to determine whether those
 
03:10:16.870 --> 03:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
are too low
 
03:10:16.880 --> 03:10:17.670 align:start position:0%
are too low
are

03:10:17.670 --> 03:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:10:21.269 --> 03:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
the cap provided ford 1435e and the 325
 
03:10:23.670 --> 03:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar cap provided for in 541.
 
03:10:25.429 --> 03:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
i think those are different
 
03:10:26.790 --> 03:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
numbers that have been established for
 
03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
different purposes and they don't really
 
03:10:30.309 --> 03:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
fit with what we're talking about here
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
so that that's how i would respond
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay so about two weeks ago i i
 
03:10:38.710 --> 03:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
understood that you all were open
 
03:10:41.670 --> 03:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
to having uh independent research
 
03:10:43.190 --> 03:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
provided to you
 
03:10:46.150 --> 03:10:46.160 align:start position:0%
should the 1.5 million ceiling be
 
03:10:48.790 --> 03:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
challenged did you did you ever receive
 
03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:49.990 align:start position:0%
challenged did you did you ever receive
any

03:10:49.990 --> 03:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
independent research to challenge no no
 
03:10:54.229 --> 03:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
we have not received that to this point
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
so representative you have a question
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh general
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
furmella while you were doing your
 
03:11:00.720 --> 03:11:01.830 align:start position:0%
furmella while you were doing your
research

03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
research
 
03:11:03.750 --> 03:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
has any work been done
 
03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
to show
 
03:11:07.269 --> 03:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
these settlements have improved the
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
person's feelings or their life or
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
anything has anyone looked into that or
 
03:11:12.399 --> 03:11:13.429 align:start position:0%
anything has anyone looked into that or
has

03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:11:15.349 --> 03:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
they've gone on as miserable as ever and
 
03:11:15.359 --> 03:11:16.070 align:start position:0%
they've gone on as miserable as ever and
and

03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:21.670 --> 03:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
so it's a fair question representative i
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
mean i'll start by answering that as no
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
we have not done that level of research
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
i i think that's because what we're
 
03:11:32.150 --> 03:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
what an appropriate number is
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
um to account for what the state's
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
exposure is if we go to court
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
and to account for
 
03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
or to determine how you just value these
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
cases generally from a damages
 
03:11:45.840 --> 03:11:47.750 align:start position:0%
cases generally from a damages
perspective

03:11:47.750 --> 03:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
it would be very hard for us to do
 
03:11:52.229 --> 03:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
general research on whether
 
03:11:54.550 --> 03:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
someone who has suffered terrible acts
 
03:11:57.510 --> 03:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
of abuse whether the money helped them
 
03:12:00.550 --> 03:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
how much good it did them
 
03:12:02.870 --> 03:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
i think that that's a really case by
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
case fact-specific inquiry that's
 
03:12:08.309 --> 03:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
difficult to conduct because i don't
 
03:12:09.830 --> 03:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of folks who are
 
03:12:12.870 --> 03:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
then tracking people who receive these
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
these monies and and tracking how well
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
or how how much of a positive impact
 
03:12:20.469 --> 03:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
that money had for them i think it's
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
fair to say that many who have suffered
 
03:12:25.110 --> 03:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
sort of terrible acts or incidents of
 
03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:26.389 align:start position:0%
sort of terrible acts or incidents of
abuse

03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this before no amount
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
of money is ever going to fix that well
 
03:12:31.830 --> 03:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to measure the positive
 
03:12:33.429 --> 03:12:33.439 align:start position:0%
impact that the money has what we're
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
really trying to determine is
 
03:12:37.269 --> 03:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
what are those cases worth what what
 
03:12:39.110 --> 03:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
what are the damages that flow from that
 
03:12:41.190 --> 03:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're finance we like to see results
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:47.030 --> 03:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay and to carry on with that just a
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
little bit further i
 
03:12:50.790 --> 03:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think i took a business law class in
 
03:12:50.800 --> 03:12:52.710 align:start position:0%
i think i took a business law class in
1979

03:12:52.710 --> 03:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
1979
 
03:12:52.720 --> 03:12:54.469 align:start position:0%
1979
and

03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:56.950 --> 03:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
the history seemed to be that it was
 
03:12:58.870 --> 03:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
generally accepted
 
03:12:58.880 --> 03:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
generally accepted
for

03:12:59.670 --> 03:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:13:03.030 --> 03:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
decades if not hundreds of years that
 
03:13:05.349 --> 03:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
financial compensation
 
03:13:08.550 --> 03:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
was the primary way in which you tried
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
to make somebody whole
 
03:13:12.550 --> 03:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
i mean if you can't if you can't go back
 
03:13:14.710 --> 03:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
and remediate the harm
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
then the financial compensation for
 
03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:18.389 align:start position:0%
then the financial compensation for
damages

03:13:18.389 --> 03:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
damages
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
is is just the standard and common way
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
that we do this in society is that fair
 
03:13:25.429 --> 03:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
i think that's fair and i think the
 
03:13:29.670 --> 03:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
reason is is because it that it i think
 
03:13:32.150 --> 03:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have historically struggled in many
 
03:13:34.070 --> 03:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
cases to come up with a better way of
 
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
remedying harm than just to pay
 
03:13:37.830 --> 03:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
financial damages
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
there are times when we when we do but
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
the more straightforward way
 
03:13:46.550 --> 03:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
is is financial compensation
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative mooney
 
03:13:50.229 --> 03:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
taking the question perhaps it's been
 
03:13:55.030 --> 03:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
said and i missed it do we have any idea
 
03:13:58.630 --> 03:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
what the total amount of individuals
 
03:14:01.910 --> 03:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
housed at the detention center is from
 
03:14:03.349 --> 03:14:03.359 align:start position:0%
its founding
 
03:14:08.550 --> 03:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:11.590 --> 03:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know the answer to that
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
question i think it's something we could
 
03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
determine i mean it's it's a fairly
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
large number but i don't have that
 
03:14:16.399 --> 03:14:17.190 align:start position:0%
large number but i don't have that
number

03:14:17.190 --> 03:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
number
 
03:14:19.590 --> 03:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
for you i i've listened to mr lipman
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
before and they they have stats on all
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
of that so i think i think to jump in
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
and answer the question uh it can be
 
03:14:28.309 --> 03:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
determined they have the records to do
 
03:14:28.319 --> 03:14:29.110 align:start position:0%
determined they have the records to do
that

03:14:29.110 --> 03:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
would you like that done should we send
 
03:14:32.550 --> 03:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
a request to mr lipman to pull that
 
03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:34.309 align:start position:0%
a request to mr lipman to pull that
together

03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think so only
 
03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
because uh this is just an attempt to
 
03:14:42.070 --> 03:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
sort of sharpen the focus as to
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about in terms of
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
numbers we've heard multiple times that
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are between four 500 alleged
 
03:14:52.070 --> 03:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
victims i think it would be helpful to
 
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
the committee to know how what
 
03:14:57.349 --> 03:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of the full residency that
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay because i'm going to ask mr ripple
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
to send the email to mr lipman so just
 
03:15:06.630 --> 03:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure we clarify exactly what
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking
 
03:15:11.190 --> 03:15:11.200 align:start position:0%
you want the total population that's
 
03:15:13.510 --> 03:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
ever gone through ydc
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
from patient one to
 
03:15:18.630 --> 03:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
resident one to
 
03:15:22.070 --> 03:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
when to today or to the beginning or
 
03:15:24.389 --> 03:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2022 what's what's your
 
03:15:24.399 --> 03:15:25.830 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2022 what's what's your
range

03:15:25.830 --> 03:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
range
 
03:15:28.790 --> 03:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh the beginning of 2022 would be fine
 
03:15:31.910 --> 03:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay do you have that mr ripple
 
03:15:34.469 --> 03:15:34.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:15:44.790 --> 03:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
i
i

03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.990 --> 03:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if the same resident had been
 
03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated more than once i suspect
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
that the number that we were asking
 
03:15:59.110 --> 03:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
the way it just got phrased would
 
03:16:02.070 --> 03:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
include some some repeat offenders so if
 
03:16:03.670 --> 03:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
somebody was there three times that
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be three i i i don't know i don't
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
know how
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
good mr lipman has a database to screen
 
03:16:12.870 --> 03:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
that out but
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i think in each of those uh
 
03:16:18.070 --> 03:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerations represents a chance for
 
03:16:18.080 --> 03:16:19.349 align:start position:0%
incarcerations represents a chance for
um

03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
violation so i i
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
although the number could be padded in a
 
03:16:26.389 --> 03:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
sense i i think it still gets at the
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
scope that representative mooney's
 
03:16:31.510 --> 03:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
looking for is it i don't want to speak
 
03:16:33.590 --> 03:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
for you though
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind mr chairman uh it
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
sounds like that may be two categories
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
of counting i was referring to
 
03:16:41.750 --> 03:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
individuals uh it sounds like
 
03:16:44.070 --> 03:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative long may be referring to
 
03:16:45.670 --> 03:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
those that have been
 
03:16:48.309 --> 03:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
sentenced there or placed there
 
03:16:48.319 --> 03:16:49.269 align:start position:0%
sentenced there or placed there
so

03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
sounds like we may be getting into two
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
categories my original thought was
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
individuals how many individuals
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
were talking
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
so you're looking for unique individuals
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
if they've been in there three times
 
03:17:02.630 --> 03:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
then you still just want to see them
 
03:17:05.349 --> 03:17:05.359 align:start position:0%
reflected as one
 
03:17:05.359 --> 03:17:07.030 align:start position:0%
reflected as one
correct

03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
all right i i think mr ripple can ask
 
03:17:13.110 --> 03:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
for that i just don't know how great
 
03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
their database is to help go through
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of a sort
 
03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:18.309 align:start position:0%
that sort of a sort
so

03:17:18.309 --> 03:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:20.309 --> 03:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll just we'll try to get the best
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
data we can from them
 
03:17:24.309 --> 03:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative walls
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just going to suggest we
 
03:17:27.990 --> 03:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
give poor mr ripple a start date i don't
 
03:17:29.349 --> 03:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
know how long
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's been there but but for example
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
anything before 1940 i can't imagine is
 
03:17:35.190 --> 03:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
going to be relevant because i can't
 
03:17:37.110 --> 03:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
imagine those victims might still be
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
alive and and from the infinity and time
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just suggesting we come up with a
 
03:17:43.990 --> 03:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable start date
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
that that's a great request and i've i
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
fudged that by knowing that we gave up
 
03:17:51.510 --> 03:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
on the 1980 start date and we can go
 
03:17:53.670 --> 03:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
back further i don't know when we first
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
opened up a ydc though
 
03:17:58.469 --> 03:17:58.479 align:start position:0%
but your point is valid you know the
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
people would have could have aged out or
 
03:18:02.550 --> 03:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
or passed away
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
so representative or excuse me
 
03:18:08.550 --> 03:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey may i weigh in please so
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:18:09.680 --> 03:18:10.950 align:start position:0%
i think
uh

03:18:10.950 --> 03:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
a way to make this not quite so
 
03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
monumental a task for the department
 
03:18:18.070 --> 03:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
would maybe be to start by asking them
 
03:18:20.070 --> 03:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
um what they have available to them
 
03:18:22.150 --> 03:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
through their electronic records i do
 
03:18:24.550 --> 03:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
think that there is um the ability to
 
03:18:26.469 --> 03:18:26.479 align:start position:0%
run a search back to a certain point of
 
03:18:28.309 --> 03:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
time and then they would have to start
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
looking at handwritten records and 1940
 
03:18:34.150 --> 03:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
would be a predecessor facility um that
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
moved in and out of agencies that no
 
03:18:37.990 --> 03:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
longer exist and had a board of trustees
 
03:18:39.190 --> 03:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
theoretically it might be possible but
 
03:18:42.870 --> 03:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
it would be an enormous amount of work
 
03:18:45.110 --> 03:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
for the department to go all the way
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
back so i don't know if that would
 
03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
answer your question representative
 
03:18:49.670 --> 03:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
mooney but i do think the department
 
03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
could fairly quickly give you a number
 
03:18:54.150 --> 03:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
of what they maintain electronically and
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
all right so i think she's agreeable to
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
that and then so obviously if if if we
 
03:19:07.349 --> 03:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
limit it to electronic records
 
03:19:09.830 --> 03:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
then we just want to know when the the
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
date begins so that we can under
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
interpret the data
 
03:19:17.590 --> 03:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
representative burger yes um
 
03:19:19.510 --> 03:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they are the plaintiff's
 
03:19:22.469 --> 03:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers have indicated they're 500
 
03:19:22.479 --> 03:19:23.510 align:start position:0%
lawyers have indicated they're 500
people

03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
so maybe they could tell us
 
03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:26.469 align:start position:0%
so maybe they could tell us
the

03:19:26.469 --> 03:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:28.790 --> 03:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
earliest date
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
that would in that would then
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
give us perhaps an idea
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
of where to start
 
03:19:39.990 --> 03:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to pull something
 
03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:40.790 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to pull something
yeah

03:19:40.790 --> 03:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:44.309 --> 03:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
i i i i don't know if we should ask you
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
something like that but do you want to
 
03:19:57.590 --> 03:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.600 --> 03:19:58.469 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
so i still think we're we may end up
 
03:20:03.349 --> 03:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
being high-centered around the idea of
 
03:20:06.389 --> 03:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
what's in the electronic records um but
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
we we now know that if it went back to
 
03:20:11.590 --> 03:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
1963 that would
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
i heard him say 63. yeah
 
03:20:15.359 --> 03:20:16.309 align:start position:0%
i heard him say 63. yeah
okay

03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:20:19.110 --> 03:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
all right and my hearing's not so good
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
03:20:20.399 --> 03:20:21.269 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
i think we i think we've gone on but you
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
never answered the question about is a
 
03:20:30.229 --> 03:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars going to cover
 
03:20:32.550 --> 03:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
this yeah and i know i've been asked
 
03:20:34.630 --> 03:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
that before and i know my answer before
 
03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
has been it
 
03:20:39.429 --> 03:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
it depends you know
 
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
it just is
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
hard to predict how many
 
03:20:45.830 --> 03:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
victims will eventually come through
 
03:20:49.750 --> 03:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:52.070 --> 03:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
what amount they're gonna get based on
 
03:20:55.269 --> 03:20:55.279 align:start position:0%
what we see regarding their allegations
 
03:20:57.030 --> 03:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
what we see when we look at it and give
 
03:20:58.389 --> 03:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
our position
 
03:20:58.399 --> 03:20:59.349 align:start position:0%
our position
um

03:20:59.349 --> 03:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's also going to depend on where the
 
03:21:00.560 --> 03:21:01.910 align:start position:0%
it's also going to depend on where the
guidelines

03:21:01.910 --> 03:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:03.190 align:start position:0%
guidelines
land

03:21:03.190 --> 03:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
land
 
03:21:06.070 --> 03:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
so is 100 million dollars enough i think
 
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
there is a reasonable possibility that
 
03:21:10.710 --> 03:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
it will not be enough at the end of the
 
03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:11.590 align:start position:0%
it will not be enough at the end of the
day

03:21:11.590 --> 03:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:21:13.429 --> 03:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know that
 
03:21:15.030 --> 03:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
now i
 
03:21:18.389 --> 03:21:18.399 align:start position:0%
and it will probably be a couple years
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
or at least a year you know one or two
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
years before we have a
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
sense to see kind of where this is going
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
so so i understand that answer i i the
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
the basis of my question was that uh
 
03:21:33.269 --> 03:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
we've expanded the scope of who might be
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
covered and the incremental expansion of
 
03:21:38.630 --> 03:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
scope i'm just curious and i don't need
 
03:21:39.990 --> 03:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
it now but
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting to know how the
 
03:21:44.950 --> 03:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
scope expansion is going to affect the
 
03:21:48.150 --> 03:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
pot what i can say on that so
 
03:21:50.070 --> 03:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
what i can say on that is this first you
 
03:21:51.429 --> 03:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
know we've expanded the scope but the
 
03:21:55.670 --> 03:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
cap is a lot lower but second
 
03:21:58.070 --> 03:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
based on discussions we've had and i
 
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
won't i don't want to go into details on
 
03:22:02.070 --> 03:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
this and i can't make guarantees based
 
03:22:03.349 --> 03:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
but based on discussions we've had with
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's council over over months
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the value of these
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
claims is that
 
03:22:16.389 --> 03:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
adding physical abuse only
 
03:22:18.070 --> 03:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
adding the folks that say have physical
 
03:22:22.150 --> 03:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
abuse only claims would not
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking a magnitude of
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
doubling or tripling the state's
 
03:22:28.469 --> 03:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
exposure you know it's it's a
 
03:22:31.590 --> 03:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage that that i don't view
 
03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
it's a percentage that that i don't view
as

03:22:33.190 --> 03:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:22:33.200 --> 03:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
as
uh

03:22:35.110 --> 03:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
extremely significant
 
03:22:38.550 --> 03:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
in the scheme of the amount of money
 
03:22:39.990 --> 03:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about i know that's very
 
03:22:42.070 --> 03:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
vague but it's i just can't give you
 
03:22:43.349 --> 03:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
exact numbers
 
03:22:43.359 --> 03:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
exact numbers
but

03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:22:45.830 --> 03:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
part of the reason we've recommended
 
03:22:49.590 --> 03:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
this and recommended a lower cap is that
 
03:22:51.750 --> 03:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
if these are the values
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you set these are the caps that you
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
set based on my understanding of who the
 
03:22:58.229 --> 03:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
the very high level understanding of who
 
03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
the physical abuse only claimants are i
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't think we're talking about a major
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
major expansion of the exposure to the
 
03:23:05.910 --> 03:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
state but that will depend on where
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
these caps end up
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:23:11.269 --> 03:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
are you ready for point six
 
03:23:11.279 --> 03:23:16.150 align:start position:0%
are you ready for point six
yes

03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:19.030 --> 03:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
point six page seven uh lines eight
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
through ten
 
03:23:22.309 --> 03:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
this was just to clarify
 
03:23:22.319 --> 03:23:23.349 align:start position:0%
this was just to clarify
that

03:23:23.349 --> 03:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:23:25.750 --> 03:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
claims will be processed in the order
 
03:23:28.389 --> 03:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
that they are received as complete not
 
03:23:30.550 --> 03:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
just in the order that they are received
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
to address the concern that someone
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
might rush to get an incomplete claim in
 
03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
to get to the front of the line
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
take a while to make their claim
 
03:23:38.950 --> 03:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
complete and then they're at the front
 
03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
of the line you don't get your place in
 
03:23:42.790 --> 03:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
line until your
 
03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.429 --> 03:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
point seven is on page eight lines
 
03:23:51.349 --> 03:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
thirty three through thirty four this
 
03:23:53.110 --> 03:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
just represents uh chairman of
 
03:23:55.990 --> 03:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
chairwoman umberger's point that there
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
should be more frequent reporting to the
 
03:24:00.389 --> 03:24:00.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee the original draft had
 
03:24:02.550 --> 03:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
annual reporting we changed that to be
 
03:24:02.560 --> 03:24:07.990 align:start position:0%
annual reporting we changed that to be
quarterly

03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
i think we have already talked about 0.8
 
03:24:13.750 --> 03:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
which was a expansion of the scope to
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
include claims of physical abuse
 
03:24:16.560 --> 03:24:17.590 align:start position:0%
include claims of physical abuse
so

03:24:17.590 --> 03:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:19.349 --> 03:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
the one additional point i'll just add
 
03:24:21.750 --> 03:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
on that concept is that
 
03:24:25.110 --> 03:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
as part of the expansion of the scope
 
03:24:27.429 --> 03:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
we have also
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
revised the factors that
 
03:24:33.030 --> 03:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
the administrator would or that the
 
03:24:36.950 --> 03:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines would consider to account for
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
the additional challenges of evaluating
 
03:24:41.830 --> 03:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
physical abuse claims so for instance
 
03:24:43.590 --> 03:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
those factors
 
03:24:43.600 --> 03:24:45.750 align:start position:0%
those factors
include

03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:24:48.150 --> 03:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
how long ago
 
03:24:50.550 --> 03:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
the events took place whether there were
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
records available that corroborate
 
03:24:55.030 --> 03:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
corroborate the events or the
 
03:24:56.389 --> 03:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
allegations those are the type of
 
03:24:58.469 --> 03:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
factors we think we should include if
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to include physical abuse
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
claims because that
 
03:25:03.590 --> 03:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
that accounts for some of the
 
03:25:05.349 --> 03:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
difficulties in evaluating those claims
 
03:25:06.790 --> 03:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
and whether there are defenses and
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.630 --> 03:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
so 0.9 is just
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
some more technical changes that were
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
made to to account for some of the other
 
03:25:22.469 --> 03:25:22.479 align:start position:0%
process changes we've made that we've
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
already discussed but
 
03:25:26.630 --> 03:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
for instance because we are now
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the administrator be
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
appointed after the guidelines are
 
03:25:33.030 --> 03:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
approved we've just had to push back
 
03:25:34.150 --> 03:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
the notice
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
the notice deadline for instance so that
 
03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
has moved i think from october to
 
03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:39.190 align:start position:0%
has moved i think from october to
december

03:25:39.190 --> 03:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
december
 
03:25:39.200 --> 03:25:40.790 align:start position:0%
december
um

03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:42.469 --> 03:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know that that's a little bit of a
 
03:25:44.790 --> 03:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
guess right as to what an appropriate
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
deadline is to get all that stuff done
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
to get the notice out and start the
 
03:25:49.190 --> 03:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
process but
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have december
 
03:25:52.710 --> 03:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
in here the reason i think we can be a
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
little bit ambitious with that deadline
 
03:25:56.150 --> 03:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:25:57.990 --> 03:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
even though the administrator it won't
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
officially be appointed until the
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
guidelines are established it doesn't
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
mean that we couldn't be working in
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
parallel on the tasks of negotiating the
 
03:26:09.030 --> 03:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
claims process and guidelines and also
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
talking about potential administrator
 
03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
candidates for us to submit to the
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
supreme court so the hope would be is
 
03:26:17.030 --> 03:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
that we work out the guidelines we get
 
03:26:18.389 --> 03:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
them approved by fiscal
 
03:26:20.309 --> 03:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
and very soon after we're ready to
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
submit a list to the supreme court
 
03:26:22.640 --> 03:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
submit a list to the supreme court
who

03:26:23.590 --> 03:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:26:24.950 --> 03:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
i think we can be we can be confident
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
the court will
 
03:26:31.110 --> 03:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
will be helpful to us in acting on that
 
03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
quickly so that that's where the kind of
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
the december first date comes from we
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
could always move that back but i think
 
03:26:39.590 --> 03:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
my experience is giving everyone a
 
03:26:41.910 --> 03:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
ambitious deadline to work to that's not
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
too ambitious will keep things moving
 
03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:48.309 align:start position:0%
too ambitious will keep things moving
along

03:26:48.309 --> 03:26:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:51.750 --> 03:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
so we we heard testimony that suggested
 
03:26:51.760 --> 03:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
so we we heard testimony that suggested
that

03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:26:56.070 --> 03:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've got the order wrong that we should
 
03:26:58.469 --> 03:26:58.479 align:start position:0%
hire the administrator before we come up
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
with the claims matrix
 
03:27:02.469 --> 03:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
what are what are your thoughts on that
 
03:27:02.479 --> 03:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
what are what are your thoughts on that
specific

03:27:03.590 --> 03:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
observation yep so i think one of the
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
primary points there from attorney
 
03:27:10.070 --> 03:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
vicinanzo was that
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator could be helpful
 
03:27:14.389 --> 03:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
perhaps in in mediating that discussion
 
03:27:16.150 --> 03:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
between claimants counsel and the
 
03:27:17.830 --> 03:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office on what those
 
03:27:22.229 --> 03:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
while i see that point
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
i think there's also an argument to be
 
03:27:28.950 --> 03:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
made and i lean towards this argument
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
that the administrator who is going to
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
be the ultimate
 
03:27:35.110 --> 03:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
judge that makes determinations on what
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
a what an award should be
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't necessarily be involved in
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
writing the
 
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
the law if you will that they're gonna
 
03:27:44.710 --> 03:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
be applying right you know we don't have
 
03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:46.150 align:start position:0%
be applying right you know we don't have
judges

03:27:46.150 --> 03:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
judges
 
03:27:47.830 --> 03:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
draft the laws they're gonna apply i
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
think i think
 
03:27:51.670 --> 03:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
working out the guidelines and then
 
03:27:53.269 --> 03:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
handing them to the administrator and
 
03:27:53.279 --> 03:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
handing them to the administrator and
saying

03:27:54.070 --> 03:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
here's essentially the law you're
 
03:27:57.349 --> 03:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
operating on different purposes of this
 
03:27:59.269 --> 03:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
this is what you will be applying
 
03:28:00.550 --> 03:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
i think there's a pretty strong argument
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
that there's more integrity to that
 
03:28:04.389 --> 03:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
process that said i
 
03:28:06.870 --> 03:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think from our perspective we're open
 
03:28:08.229 --> 03:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
we're open to thinking about that
 
03:28:10.710 --> 03:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
differently but that's why we have we
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
have recommended
 
03:28:15.030 --> 03:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
for now setting it up in that order
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
so so i have a two two part question
 
03:28:20.469 --> 03:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
one is um
 
03:28:22.630 --> 03:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
should we get some experience with this
 
03:28:25.190 --> 03:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we think that the ranges just were
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
wrong for a category or multiple
 
03:28:27.600 --> 03:28:29.349 align:start position:0%
wrong for a category or multiple
categories

03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
categories
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
is there a process or what what would we
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
do in order to
 
03:28:34.479 --> 03:28:36.229 align:start position:0%
do in order to
relook

03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
relook
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
the claims matrix to see if it's you
 
03:28:39.910 --> 03:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
know needs to be tweaked
 
03:28:42.550 --> 03:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
so the process that this draft provides
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
for is that it it the matrix can be
 
03:28:46.950 --> 03:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
tweaked by agreement of claimants
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
counsel and the ag but by coming back to
 
03:28:51.670 --> 03:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee for approval of any
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
revisions okay and then the second
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
you guys are putting so much work into
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
this is there benefit of having the
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
administrator on board
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
a little early anyways to help relieve
 
03:29:07.910 --> 03:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
the administrative workload of the ag's
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:14.790 --> 03:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
so i would say
 
03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
yes there's always benefit to relieving
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
the administrative burden i do think a
 
03:29:21.030 --> 03:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the work that will happen
 
03:29:24.790 --> 03:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
prior to the administrator coming on is
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
is negotiation it's really the
 
03:29:28.469 --> 03:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
negotiation regarding
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
what the process and guidelines look
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
like when the administrator comes on
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's their job to take that and
 
03:29:36.469 --> 03:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
implement it
 
03:29:36.479 --> 03:29:37.429 align:start position:0%
implement it
i

03:29:37.429 --> 03:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the administrator can
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
relieve us of the work we would be doing
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
aside from them the work they're going
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be doing doesn't really overlap with
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
the work that we'll be doing before they
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
so just to challenge that idea so you'll
 
03:29:55.750 --> 03:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
be sending out the public uh or the
 
03:29:57.590 --> 03:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
press releases to all the different
 
03:30:00.150 --> 03:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
media that we've talked about before
 
03:30:02.309 --> 03:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
before the administrator gets there no i
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
think the administrator is responsible
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
for that so the administrator once
 
03:30:07.590 --> 03:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
they're on board they're responsible for
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
putting out all the notices and
 
03:30:09.840 --> 03:30:10.790 align:start position:0%
putting out all the notices and
yeah

03:30:10.790 --> 03:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:30:12.630 --> 03:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
all right so is there any value in front
 
03:30:15.670 --> 03:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
loading that so that you know we
 
03:30:20.309 --> 03:30:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
well i think it
 
03:30:25.190 --> 03:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
again it depends because if i think
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
the notice really shouldn't go out until
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
the guidelines have been adopted because
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:35.590 --> 03:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
part of the importance of the guidelines
 
03:30:37.349 --> 03:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
is that that gives notice to these
 
03:30:38.790 --> 03:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
potential claimants of what they're
 
03:30:40.469 --> 03:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
signing up for if they decide to come
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
through this process and i i think that
 
03:30:45.110 --> 03:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
addresses a concern that's been raised
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
this is intended to be an alternative
 
03:30:51.190 --> 03:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
option to traditional litigation so
 
03:30:53.269 --> 03:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
we want
 
03:30:56.070 --> 03:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
claimants to have ample advance notice
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
of what this looks like before they even
 
03:31:00.150 --> 03:31:00.160 align:start position:0%
start to think about signing up
 
03:31:02.070 --> 03:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't have to sign up for
 
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
this and if an individual claimant
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
thinks it isn't fair or it's not enough
 
03:31:07.110 --> 03:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
or it's not going to provide enough
 
03:31:08.309 --> 03:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
relief they can go through the
 
03:31:08.319 --> 03:31:10.830 align:start position:0%
relief they can go through the
litigation

03:31:10.830 --> 03:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.790 --> 03:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
all right so that i think brings us to
 
03:31:16.800 --> 03:31:18.309 align:start position:0%
all right so that i think brings us to
point

03:31:18.309 --> 03:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:31:18.319 --> 03:31:20.070 align:start position:0%
point
10

03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
10
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
which we have talked about
 
03:31:23.910 --> 03:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:31:26.229 --> 03:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
the this this we discussed it previously
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
so i'll just hit it quickly
 
03:31:29.910 --> 03:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
this is the change where we have moved
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
to the point at which a claimant has to
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
waive their right to go to court from
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
the filing of the claim
 
03:31:36.720 --> 03:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
the filing of the claim
to

03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
the moment where they have to decide
 
03:31:41.190 --> 03:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
whether to take whatever they've been
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
offered by the attorney general or go to
 
03:31:45.910 --> 03:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
the resolution process under this draft
 
03:31:48.150 --> 03:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
if you decide to go to a resolution
 
03:31:50.229 --> 03:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
process with the administrator
 
03:31:51.670 --> 03:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
at that point you're waiving your right
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
court so that that's that change
 
03:31:58.469 --> 03:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
and then point 11
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
we just put it on here we we haven't put
 
03:32:02.710 --> 03:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
sunset language in here yet but it's on
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
our list to do it just is we need to
 
03:32:05.600 --> 03:32:06.469 align:start position:0%
our list to do it just is we need to
know

03:32:06.469 --> 03:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:32:08.630 --> 03:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
kind of we need to be close to the final
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
place of what provisions this will
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
contain before we can say which
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
provisions need to sunset and which
 
03:32:19.990 --> 03:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.950 --> 03:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
do you have any alibis you got things
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that you want to add to that i'm sorry
 
03:32:27.030 --> 03:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
military term um
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh do you have any additional comments
 
03:32:31.750 --> 03:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
that are not on your summary
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
or that
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
previous testimony raised some issues
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
that you weren't prepared beforehand to
 
03:32:39.030 --> 03:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
deal with is there any you got any
 
03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:40.070 align:start position:0%
deal with is there any you got any
strays

03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
strays
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll hit a couple just on the right
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
to know concerns and i know miss timmons
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
is going to take a look at that summary
 
03:32:48.150 --> 03:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
and bring it back
 
03:32:49.750 --> 03:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to reiterate that you know
 
03:32:49.760 --> 03:32:50.630 align:start position:0%
i just want to reiterate that you know
we

03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:32:52.229 --> 03:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
what we're trying
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
let me say this transparency i think in
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
this process is very important but what
 
03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is balance the need
 
03:32:59.830 --> 03:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
for transparency
 
03:33:02.389 --> 03:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
with i think the need to have
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
at least the option for privacy for
 
03:33:05.910 --> 03:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
victims who might come through this
 
03:33:09.190 --> 03:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
process and this is a a pretty unique
 
03:33:11.190 --> 03:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
process that we're setting up
 
03:33:12.950 --> 03:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
and it's why i've said before and i
 
03:33:15.590 --> 03:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
would i would say it now i don't think
 
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
the 91a just process of
 
03:33:21.190 --> 03:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
balancing the privacy interests with
 
03:33:23.429 --> 03:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
with the interests of the public
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
is a good
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism to apply to this process
 
03:33:29.590 --> 03:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
because part of making a victim
 
03:33:30.790 --> 03:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable with going through this
 
03:33:32.630 --> 03:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
process is some level of certainty on
 
03:33:33.830 --> 03:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
how much privacy they're going to be
 
03:33:34.950 --> 03:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
so i i would be uncomfortable with just
 
03:33:39.670 --> 03:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
relying on 91a if there are additional
 
03:33:42.229 --> 03:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
tweaks to the language that we have here
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
or the exemption that we put in here
 
03:33:45.830 --> 03:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
that someone wants to recommend i think
 
03:33:47.830 --> 03:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's room for that but i just wanted
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
to hit that that i think not relying on
 
03:33:55.269 --> 03:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.150 --> 03:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
then i'll just run through
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
i think i've hit a lot of the points
 
03:34:04.870 --> 03:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that were provided in a claimant's
 
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i've covered everything
 
03:34:18.870 --> 03:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to cover i'll just uh
 
03:34:21.510 --> 03:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
look to attorney ramsey in case there's
 
03:34:28.070 --> 03:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
at the last work session there was a
 
03:34:30.239 --> 03:34:31.670 align:start position:0%
at the last work session there was a
question

03:34:31.670 --> 03:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
asking us to look into whether there was
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
any sort of a national database that we
 
03:34:36.870 --> 03:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
could look to
 
03:34:39.510 --> 03:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
potential claimants that might be in
 
03:34:42.000 --> 03:34:42.790 align:start position:0%
potential claimants that might be in
other

03:34:42.790 --> 03:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:34:44.950 --> 03:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
state facilities
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
i have looked into that and wanted to
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
let you know
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we've not identified any kind of a
 
03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:52.150 align:start position:0%
that we've not identified any kind of a
database

03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
database
 
03:34:54.389 --> 03:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
like is requested
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
the only thing that
 
03:34:59.349 --> 03:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
we could identify that might be able to
 
03:35:01.030 --> 03:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
be used is there is a professional
 
03:35:04.469 --> 03:35:04.479 align:start position:0%
association of administrators uh well of
 
03:35:05.990 --> 03:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
corrections of
 
03:35:06.000 --> 03:35:07.110 align:start position:0%
corrections of
uh

03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
officers and there is a directory that
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
that organization publishes it would be
 
03:35:14.950 --> 03:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
possible that the administrator could um
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
reach out to the
 
03:35:18.630 --> 03:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
the leaders of other states facilities
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
and and just request as an accommodation
 
03:35:22.150 --> 03:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
that they circulate the word within
 
03:35:24.389 --> 03:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
their facilities but we did not find any
 
03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
way to
 
03:35:25.520 --> 03:35:27.269 align:start position:0%
way to
identify

03:35:27.269 --> 03:35:27.279 align:start position:0%
identify
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
by individual a mailing address if you
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
will and send a letter directly to that
 
03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:34.070 align:start position:0%
will and send a letter directly to that
individual

03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
i i forget who asked that question i
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
think that was you represented walls
 
03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
does that do it still seems like there's
 
03:35:42.630 --> 03:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
a an
 
03:35:45.510 --> 03:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
avenue to try to find people who may be
 
03:35:48.150 --> 03:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in other states is do you
 
03:35:50.070 --> 03:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
understand where we're at are you okay
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
with that i do you know it is what it is
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't exist i mean i asked if
 
03:35:56.550 --> 03:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's a national database the answer
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
apparently is no if that's the case
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
i commend them for coming up with
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
another alternative and that is to try
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
and find a way to reach out to those
 
03:36:07.110 --> 03:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
facilities and publish the uh
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:13.030 --> 03:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
oh all right um anything else
 
03:36:14.790 --> 03:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
attorney ramsey uh we i got
 
03:36:16.790 --> 03:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative lynn
 
03:36:20.309 --> 03:36:20.319 align:start position:0%
i had just just one question on on
 
03:36:22.710 --> 03:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh section 10 on the bottom of page
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
seven over on to eight um
 
03:36:25.520 --> 03:36:26.550 align:start position:0%
seven over on to eight um
the

03:36:26.550 --> 03:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:28.870 --> 03:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
am i corr am i correct in understanding
 
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the last sentence of that section
 
03:36:33.349 --> 03:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
which says the conduct of such a meeting
 
03:36:34.710 --> 03:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered part of the
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
resolution process and shall not be
 
03:36:37.920 --> 03:36:39.190 align:start position:0%
resolution process and shall not be
available

03:36:39.190 --> 03:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:36:41.590 --> 03:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
if a resolution process is requested
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
until after it is completed in my
 
03:36:45.510 --> 03:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that that means
 
03:36:47.990 --> 03:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that that meeting shall not occur
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
until after the administrator has
 
03:36:51.910 --> 03:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
rendered a decision
 
03:36:53.830 --> 03:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes and that was to address the concern
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
that you know sort of that private
 
03:36:57.750 --> 03:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
moment with the judge right right and
 
03:36:59.910 --> 03:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
suddenly suddenly the value of the claim
 
03:37:02.229 --> 03:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
goes up or whatever yeah okay that's
 
03:37:02.239 --> 03:37:05.590 align:start position:0%
goes up or whatever yeah okay that's
fine

03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.349 --> 03:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay so
 
03:37:09.830 --> 03:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
so um i just want to walk through the
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
timeline and and i mr well go ahead
 
03:37:14.790 --> 03:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
representative walls before i do that
 
03:37:17.190 --> 03:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
thank you i think before you get into
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
the housekeeping there's something i
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
want to say as i'm sitting here
 
03:37:21.750 --> 03:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
listening to all this and looking at the
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
latest of this is best i can look at it
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
kind of on the fly
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
this process is only going to work if
 
03:37:29.190 --> 03:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
the plaintiffs buy in
 
03:37:31.349 --> 03:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
and the plaintiff's attorneys have i
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
know been trying to work with you to
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
create a process that they think their
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
clients are going to buy into
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go somewhere that i've
 
03:37:38.870 --> 03:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
never gone before in the legislature and
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
that's actually to a hollywood movie
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
03:37:45.670 --> 03:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
on last friday i i did the
 
03:37:48.389 --> 03:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
bar review uh my cles and one of them
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
was ken feinberg i don't know if either
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
of you were uh watch that
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
um and at the beginning of of his cla
 
03:37:55.750 --> 03:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
ken feinberg for those of you who don't
 
03:37:57.670 --> 03:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
recall was the mediator who settled all
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the 911 cases and it's done quite a
 
03:38:02.229 --> 03:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
few since then but he's best known for
 
03:38:03.750 --> 03:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the 9 11 cases
 
03:38:05.590 --> 03:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
take this down for a minute anyway he
 
03:38:07.830 --> 03:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
announced that the movie worth that both
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
he and his kids and his if his kids are
 
03:38:11.190 --> 03:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
like my elbow on netflix if you have
 
03:38:13.830 --> 03:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
netflix but it was really interesting
 
03:38:15.750 --> 03:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
because a lot of what the movie focused
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
on was sort of the evolution of mr
 
03:38:21.990 --> 03:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
feinberg and his staff and understanding
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
the needs of the victims and sort of
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
bending a bit of their process to meet
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
the needs of the victims
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
and trying to get the victims to sign on
 
03:38:34.550 --> 03:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
and they had set a goal that they had to
 
03:38:36.309 --> 03:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
have 80 percent of the victims sign on
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
or they thought that it wouldn't work
 
03:38:40.469 --> 03:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
and they're sitting there the day before
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
the deadline and they got 55 percent of
 
03:38:43.990 --> 03:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
the victims
 
03:38:45.910 --> 03:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
and of course there's this dramatic end
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
where they do some of the correct moves
 
03:38:49.510 --> 03:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
and make some of the correct
 
03:38:52.790 --> 03:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
considerations so they end up with 97 of
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
the victims signed on to that process
 
03:38:57.269 --> 03:38:57.279 align:start position:0%
but it was an evolution over two years
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
that you sort of see in that movie of
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
how everybody on both sides got there
 
03:39:03.750 --> 03:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
how they got there to meet the needs of
 
03:39:05.510 --> 03:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
the victims and how the victims got
 
03:39:07.590 --> 03:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
there to realize that this really was a
 
03:39:09.590 --> 03:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
fair settlement
 
03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it was i bring that up because
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're trying to do
 
03:39:15.750 --> 03:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
here we're trying to find that sweet
 
03:39:17.429 --> 03:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
spot where
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
it limits the exposure of the state and
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
where it also provides a system where
 
03:39:24.790 --> 03:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
the victims are going to say yes this is
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
a process that works for me
 
03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of things in here
 
03:39:31.030 --> 03:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
that concern me that we're not going to
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
get the victims to sign on to this
 
03:39:37.990 --> 03:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know we started with a ver a more um
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
uh trauma-informed process
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think we are moving away from that to
 
03:39:43.910 --> 03:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
some extent
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think the change in the language about
 
03:39:47.830 --> 03:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
whether the victims there's a
 
03:39:49.269 --> 03:39:49.279 align:start position:0%
presumption the victims are to be
 
03:39:51.269 --> 03:39:51.279 align:start position:0%
believed is part of that and that
 
03:39:52.630 --> 03:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
concerns me
 
03:39:54.229 --> 03:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
and and i guess i just wanted to say
 
03:39:56.790 --> 03:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
this to say let's keep in mind what
 
03:39:58.229 --> 03:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here we're trying to
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
set up a process that the victims are
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
going to buy into
 
03:40:04.950 --> 03:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that's not easy to do i'm not naive
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
about that and and so i'm just trying to
 
03:40:09.990 --> 03:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody here to get to that
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
point because i think it's in
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's interest to have a system
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
that the victims will buy into because
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
every lawyer in this room and probably a
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
lot of other people know litigation is
 
03:40:23.110 --> 03:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
never a great way to go it's just not
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's really hard on everybody it's
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
expensive it's emotionally draining it's
 
03:40:29.990 --> 03:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
just tough and we have the potential
 
03:40:31.830 --> 03:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
here to come up with a system that
 
03:40:33.830 --> 03:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't re-victimize these victims by
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
making them go through the litigation so
 
03:40:38.229 --> 03:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
i guess what i really wanted to say is
 
03:40:40.469 --> 03:40:40.479 align:start position:0%
let's keep in mind this process of what
 
03:40:41.910 --> 03:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do we're trying to get
 
03:40:44.630 --> 03:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
to something that is protective of the
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
state and and the state's exposure but
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
also is something that the victims
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
are actually going to be willing to
 
03:40:52.150 --> 03:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
accept because i'm not sure we're there
 
03:40:52.160 --> 03:40:56.229 align:start position:0%
accept because i'm not sure we're there
yet

03:40:56.229 --> 03:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.550 --> 03:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
you're free to respond if you'd like
 
03:41:00.870 --> 03:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
yep no i mean i i'll start by just
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
saying this i i absolutely agree that
 
03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know that this is tough and and we
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
really want to get to a place where
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
where as many victims as possible will
 
03:41:10.720 --> 03:41:12.469 align:start position:0%
where as many victims as possible will
participate

03:41:12.469 --> 03:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:41:14.469 --> 03:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
i also think that
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
we we should keep in mind that
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
we probably will never get to a place
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
where every single victim will
 
03:41:20.960 --> 03:41:22.309 align:start position:0%
where every single victim will
participate

03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
participate
 
03:41:22.319 --> 03:41:24.469 align:start position:0%
participate
and

03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:24.479 --> 03:41:25.189 align:start position:0%
and
i

03:41:25.189 --> 03:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:41:27.590 --> 03:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
we also won't this is one step in kind
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
of i think as this bill is setting out a
 
03:41:30.870 --> 03:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
process that will play out even after
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed it will depend on
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
what the guidelines look like what the
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
process looks like
 
03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:37.110 align:start position:0%
process looks like
so

03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to be hard to
 
03:41:41.830 --> 03:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
to guarantee participation the last
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
point i'll make is this and there's no
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
way to make this point without sounding
 
03:41:47.590 --> 03:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
a little cold and i don't mean it this
 
03:41:49.110 --> 03:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
way but
 
03:41:52.150 --> 03:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
we want the victims to participate
 
03:41:53.429 --> 03:41:53.439 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
i as attorney general at least have a
 
03:41:55.279 --> 03:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
i as attorney general at least have a
responsibility

03:41:56.550 --> 03:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
not to
 
03:42:00.710 --> 03:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
have that become so dominant of a
 
03:42:03.830 --> 03:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
consideration that we pay out more money
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
than is fair because i think at the end
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
there's no question that the more money
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's available the more attractive
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
this process will be and we want this
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
process to be fair and attractive enough
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
that it provides a good option but
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
not so attractive that it is
 
03:42:25.830 --> 03:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
we're simply paying more than the state
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
really should be paying when you look at
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
what these claims would be valued at
 
03:42:33.429 --> 03:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
based on past settlements based on what
 
03:42:35.189 --> 03:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
the state ex states exposure is in
 
03:42:37.030 --> 03:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
litigation at least that as the state's
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
attorney i think i have to express that
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
view ultimately there are policy
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
considerations that that the committee
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think can take
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh can take into consideration that
 
03:42:48.790 --> 03:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
might lead you to a different conclusion
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
but i just felt it was important to
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
express i think where where we come from
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
as the attorney general's office it's
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
balancing i think the desire that
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative waltz articulated and
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
also balancing i think what is our
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
obligation to to not recommend that the
 
03:43:06.309 --> 03:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
state do something more than we think it
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
really should do based on the risk
 
03:43:10.790 --> 03:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
again we can make that recommendation
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
then the committee can decide to do
 
03:43:13.349 --> 03:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
something different but i think our
 
03:43:15.189 --> 03:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation needs to stay consistent
 
03:43:19.269 --> 03:43:19.279 align:start position:0%
with that that duty that i have
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh any
 
03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
further questions or comments from the
 
03:43:25.510 --> 03:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
do we do is there anyone out in the
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
audience that uh
 
03:43:31.830 --> 03:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
feels compelled to speak up we're
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
closing in on the end here
 
03:43:37.830 --> 03:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm not seeing anyone so so i'm gonna
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna ramble a little bit and this
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
is for mr hoffman mr ripple
 
03:43:43.910 --> 03:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative umberger and of course
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
the ag's office
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
where we're where i think we are
 
03:43:50.790 --> 03:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
03:43:53.510 --> 03:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
if we look at uh tuesday
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
um march 1st it's really like right upon
 
03:43:57.040 --> 03:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
um march 1st it's really like right upon
us

03:43:58.070 --> 03:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
us
 
03:44:00.710 --> 03:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
is there any rational way in which we
 
03:44:03.429 --> 03:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
can take all of the feedback that you've
 
03:44:05.510 --> 03:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
gotten today
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
turn it into
 
03:44:10.710 --> 03:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know version three of the ag's world
 
03:44:10.720 --> 03:44:11.590 align:start position:0%
you know version three of the ag's world
um

03:44:11.590 --> 03:44:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:12.469 --> 03:44:12.479 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:44:16.710 --> 03:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
miss ripple mr hoffman i i i think this
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
the thing that we vote on
 
03:44:21.030 --> 03:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
needs to come through ols doesn't i
 
03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
we're not going through ols now as as
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're in the work process but but what
 
03:44:28.830 --> 03:44:28.840 align:start position:0%
we vote on needs to go be a
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
ols validated right so i'm seeing a yes
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
on that
 
03:44:33.600 --> 03:44:34.630 align:start position:0%
on that
so

03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
is this are we even in the
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
area of the doable with that kind of a
 
03:44:42.790 --> 03:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
timeline given that um the claims
 
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
attorney wants to
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
take some time to think about the
 
03:44:51.750 --> 03:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
appointment of the administrator
 
03:44:53.830 --> 03:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
can can we get that done representative
 
03:44:56.790 --> 03:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
umberger what do you think um what
 
03:45:00.150 --> 03:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
what i would recommend is that uh
 
03:45:04.950 --> 03:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
kevin take what we have here to ols
 
03:45:07.269 --> 03:45:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay and get up
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
and get us
 
03:45:12.070 --> 03:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
a draft from ols
 
03:45:12.080 --> 03:45:13.429 align:start position:0%
a draft from ols
for

03:45:13.429 --> 03:45:13.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:45:16.229 --> 03:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
tues tuesday whatever whatever day it is
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
03:45:19.990 --> 03:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they can turn that around
 
03:45:22.389 --> 03:45:22.399 align:start position:0%
without without a problem this is not a
 
03:45:22.399 --> 03:45:23.590 align:start position:0%
without without a problem this is not a
heavy

03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
heavy
 
03:45:25.590 --> 03:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
time for them
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:45:30.309 --> 03:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
all of us know
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
at this point what's in here
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
so if
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
people have recommended changes
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
then they need to come to us and say
 
03:45:42.560 --> 03:45:43.590 align:start position:0%
then they need to come to us and say
on

03:45:43.590 --> 03:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
page six
 
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
this is my recommendation for new
 
03:45:50.720 --> 03:45:51.990 align:start position:0%
this is my recommendation for new
wording

03:45:51.990 --> 03:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
wording
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then we can turn that around
 
03:45:56.790 --> 03:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
and not and not come in and say well i
 
03:45:58.469 --> 03:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
don't i don't agree
 
03:46:00.950 --> 03:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't have something
 
03:46:03.349 --> 03:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
to replace what
 
03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know what's currently here we can go
 
03:46:07.590 --> 03:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
on until june
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
and never get
 
03:46:08.880 --> 03:46:10.229 align:start position:0%
and never get
resolution

03:46:10.229 --> 03:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
so it just i guess that i'm i'm just
 
03:46:14.550 --> 03:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
saying that you know
 
03:46:17.030 --> 03:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ag will
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
make the recommended changes and he'll
 
03:46:20.550 --> 03:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
come back
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know kind of like you did and say
 
03:46:25.750 --> 03:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know page four we need to
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
make these changes and
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
if um
 
03:46:31.750 --> 03:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's attorney comes in he needs
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
to say this is what
 
03:46:39.189 --> 03:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
the language i want for
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
choosing the our uh administrator
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're going to be in
 
03:46:44.160 --> 03:46:45.349 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're going to be in
this

03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:46:47.990 --> 03:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then i think at that point
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
we can either
 
03:46:50.560 --> 03:46:52.389 align:start position:0%
we can either
uh

03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
either say
 
03:46:56.150 --> 03:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:46:58.790 --> 03:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
how many of you agree with what
 
03:47:02.550 --> 03:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has in that area
 
03:47:05.670 --> 03:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
how many of you agree with the changes
 
03:47:08.389 --> 03:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
that have been recommended by
 
03:47:11.110 --> 03:47:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know joe jones
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
all right okay so it so it'll i
 
03:47:13.920 --> 03:47:15.030 align:start position:0%
all right okay so it so it'll i
hopefully

03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
it will
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know speed up the process there's no
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
doubt that we're going to have to have
 
03:47:23.510 --> 03:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
another meeting right
 
03:47:25.030 --> 03:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
so the first
 
03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
so as you
 
03:47:28.150 --> 03:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
two were taking notes
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
is did you did you take any notes that
 
03:47:33.750 --> 03:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
tells you that you want to go to version
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
three or or did you just confirm that
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
version two
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll let jen weigh in on this too my
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
sense is we wouldn't have a lot
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
we'd have some pretty minor changes
 
03:47:52.710 --> 03:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
coming out of this at least
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
for now that we would recommend so i
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
don't i don't see a lot of robust
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
changes for a version three um
 
03:48:02.309 --> 03:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
so i think what
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
we could do one of two things to be
 
03:48:07.189 --> 03:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
helpful on tuesday we could either
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
bring another revision or
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
we could bring
 
03:48:12.710 --> 03:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
we could come with
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
any changes we have kind of a list
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
instead so that
 
03:48:17.429 --> 03:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's kind of what i know happens
 
03:48:20.950 --> 03:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes in the process there's a vote
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
on a change without seeing the exact
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
language and then okay we approve that
 
03:48:24.479 --> 03:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
language and then okay we approve that
change

03:48:25.349 --> 03:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
go do language we could come with a list
 
03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
like that because if you're going to
 
03:48:31.670 --> 03:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
send something to ols today
 
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
and have that in front of you on tuesday
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
it might be confusing for us then to
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
have another red line as opposed to a
 
03:48:39.990 --> 03:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
sheet of what i would imagine would be
 
03:48:41.590 --> 03:48:41.600 align:start position:0%
if any changes for the purposes of
 
03:48:41.600 --> 03:48:42.550 align:start position:0%
if any changes for the purposes of
tuesday

03:48:42.550 --> 03:48:42.560 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
fairly minor i i think i'd like to go a
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
third way okay
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
and and and i'm i'm trying to respect my
 
03:48:49.920 --> 03:48:51.429 align:start position:0%
and and and i'm i'm trying to respect my
chairman's

03:48:51.429 --> 03:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
chairman's
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
feedback and what what i think i heard
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
you say that makes sense though is let's
 
03:48:59.030 --> 03:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
let's get what we can over to ols
 
03:48:59.040 --> 03:49:00.710 align:start position:0%
let's get what we can over to ols
immediately

03:49:00.710 --> 03:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
03:49:03.510 --> 03:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
under the belief that we're we're really
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
getting close
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay and that gives ols an opportunity
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
to create a document for us on tuesday
 
03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
that this group
 
03:49:12.880 --> 03:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
that this group
can

03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
choose to move potentially to the
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
03:49:19.990 --> 03:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to get that document
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
so we can at least say yes or no to a
 
03:49:25.830 --> 03:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
specific approved document is that is
 
03:49:25.840 --> 03:49:26.870 align:start position:0%
specific approved document is that is
that

03:49:26.870 --> 03:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:29.429 --> 03:49:29.439 align:start position:0%
with with whatever changes they might
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
sure people could still come back to us
 
03:49:31.600 --> 03:49:32.469 align:start position:0%
sure people could still come back to us
right

03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:49:35.429 --> 03:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
on tuesday but but can you
 
03:49:37.510 --> 03:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
given the lateness of the day and the
 
03:49:39.750 --> 03:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
fact that it's uh predicted that we're
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
going to do another snowmageddon
 
03:49:44.469 --> 03:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow that can can we get something
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
or is this coming to you kevin or to to
 
03:49:48.960 --> 03:49:50.469 align:start position:0%
or is this coming to you kevin or to to
mike

03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
mike
 
03:49:52.389 --> 03:49:52.399 align:start position:0%
to go to ols
 
03:49:54.309 --> 03:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
who's who's gonna com
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay can you can you get sort of um what
 
03:49:59.429 --> 03:49:59.439 align:start position:0%
you think is a thumbs up
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
to to to us and specifically to mr
 
03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
ripple so he can get ols cranked because
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'd like i'd like a formal document
 
03:50:08.239 --> 03:50:09.670 align:start position:0%
i'd like i'd like a formal document
tuesday

03:50:09.670 --> 03:50:09.680 align:start position:0%

tuesday
sure

03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:50:12.309 --> 03:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i think what we
 
03:50:14.070 --> 03:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think any changes we'd have at this
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
point we could do
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
fast and so we we would get yeah we
 
03:50:21.189 --> 03:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
could get that to ols quickly i think in
 
03:50:23.910 --> 03:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
time for them to turn it around by
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
tuesday all right yeah or send it to
 
03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:29.199 align:start position:0%

representative

03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman you know what
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the only the only question that i had
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i may be misinterpreting attorney
 
03:50:38.150 --> 03:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
vicinanzo but
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me like
 
03:50:43.030 --> 03:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
many of the things that we have sort of
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
um that we have talked about and that
 
03:50:46.469 --> 03:50:46.479 align:start position:0%
you've talked about
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
are things that it may be that that you
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
know he would end up being able to agree
 
03:50:54.070 --> 03:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
with the one thing that i that
 
03:50:56.550 --> 03:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me and if you know correct
 
03:50:58.309 --> 03:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
me i guess i'd say correct me if i'm
 
03:51:00.550 --> 03:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
wrong the one thing that that it seemed
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
like was a big a big point that he
 
03:51:05.830 --> 03:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
objected to strenuously and we
 
03:51:07.670 --> 03:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
and i guess i'm just wondering have we
 
03:51:08.950 --> 03:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
03:51:11.429 --> 03:51:11.439 align:start position:0%
at least tentatively kind of uh
 
03:51:13.349 --> 03:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
taken a position as as a committee on
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is the issue of whether the the
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
the basis of liability should be
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
extended beyond
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and physical abuse to other
 
03:51:26.070 --> 03:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
things um because that seemed to me to
 
03:51:28.870 --> 03:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
be a big point of his which we which we
 
03:51:30.870 --> 03:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
haven't focused on i'm i mean just
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
speaking personally i'm perfectly
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
content with leaving it exactly where it
 
03:51:36.630 --> 03:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
is but um
 
03:51:37.910 --> 03:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
but you know i don't know how everybody
 
03:51:40.389 --> 03:51:40.399 align:start position:0%
else feels about that okay so to to that
 
03:51:40.399 --> 03:51:41.590 align:start position:0%
else feels about that okay so to to that
end

03:51:41.590 --> 03:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
end
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
i i'd like to just see an informal show
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
of hands of the committee
 
03:51:47.910 --> 03:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
on whether or not
 
03:51:49.349 --> 03:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
you think that the
 
03:51:52.229 --> 03:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
scope should be extended to include
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
physical abuse only because that was the
 
03:51:58.229 --> 03:51:58.239 align:start position:0%
the new new thing in the scope today and
 
03:52:00.309 --> 03:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
mr chairman isn't that already in this
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
proposed build that we had before us
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
today that it includes physical beings
 
03:52:07.189 --> 03:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
it is but we to to representative lin's
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh remark
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have a sense of the
 
03:52:14.229 --> 03:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
committee specifically on this issue and
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
it's fairly significant
 
03:52:17.110 --> 03:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:52:19.189 --> 03:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
so i i would like
 
03:52:20.630 --> 03:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
you to entertain
 
03:52:23.670 --> 03:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
a request to do a show of hands on
 
03:52:25.110 --> 03:52:25.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
the physical abuse addition to the scope
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
should be included or or if we want to
 
03:52:33.189 --> 03:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
have that removed you know mr chair can
 
03:52:35.110 --> 03:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
i could i just ask raise a point of
 
03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
clarification i
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
i think what what i was really asking is
 
03:52:42.309 --> 03:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
i i guess i was and maybe wrongly so but
 
03:52:43.830 --> 03:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
i was sort of assuming just from the
 
03:52:44.790 --> 03:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
lack of
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
comment from other people on the
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
committee that we were sort of generally
 
03:52:48.560 --> 03:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
committee that we were sort of generally
agreed

03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that that physical abuse
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
would be covered my question was more
 
03:52:56.710 --> 03:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
attorney vicinanzo said it should be
 
03:52:59.269 --> 03:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
even further than that and that was what
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
i was you know are we sort of
 
03:53:03.030 --> 03:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
comfortable what i was really asking is
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
are we sort of comfortable
 
03:53:06.469 --> 03:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
leaving it to
 
03:53:08.710 --> 03:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and physical abuse and not
 
03:53:10.389 --> 03:53:10.399 align:start position:0%
going any further than that that was my
 
03:53:13.750 --> 03:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
question okay okay so so i don't i i'm
 
03:53:16.229 --> 03:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
fine we'll get there but this first step
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
in this journey i think is just to find
 
03:53:20.950 --> 03:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
out if people are okay with adding to
 
03:53:24.550 --> 03:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
the scope claims that deal strictly with
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
physical abuse
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
so uh representative umberger do you
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:34.830 --> 03:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
03:53:38.790 --> 03:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
so all right so uh raise your hands if
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
you think the addition of the physical
 
03:53:43.990 --> 03:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
abuse to the scope of this
 
03:53:46.790 --> 03:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh legislation is something you can
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
support mr chairman i have a question
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
before we vote it's representative walls
 
03:53:52.950 --> 03:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay this is just an informal vote by
 
03:53:55.590 --> 03:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
the way but i still need clarification
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
does physical infuse accu include
 
03:54:00.150 --> 03:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
solitary confinement because that would
 
03:54:02.870 --> 03:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
address the the vote here
 
03:54:06.070 --> 03:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
so so the next question on this is gets
 
03:54:08.550 --> 03:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
you what you're asking is the second
 
03:54:10.790 --> 03:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
vote we're going to take i think to to
 
03:54:10.800 --> 03:54:11.830 align:start position:0%
vote we're going to take i think to to
explore

03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
explore
 
03:54:14.070 --> 03:54:14.080 align:start position:0%
representative lin's question about
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're okay with the
 
03:54:15.840 --> 03:54:17.189 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're okay with the
definition

03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
definition
 
03:54:19.429 --> 03:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
as written
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
so so you're not i can tell because you
 
03:54:24.550 --> 03:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
would like solitary confinement included
 
03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
as part of the definition of physical
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
abuse i get that i just want to i just
 
03:54:30.630 --> 03:54:30.640 align:start position:0%
want to do this take two bites of the
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
apple instead of eating the whole thing
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
at once
 
03:54:35.750 --> 03:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
i want to understand what i'm voting on
 
03:54:37.910 --> 03:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's all okay so i'll say it one more
 
03:54:40.710 --> 03:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
time all we're doing with this raising
 
03:54:43.429 --> 03:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
of hands is demonstrating whether or not
 
03:54:45.429 --> 03:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
you support
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
adding physical abuse by itself as
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
a basis of filing a claim
 
03:54:53.279 --> 03:54:54.229 align:start position:0%
a basis of filing a claim
because

03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:54:56.870 --> 03:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
until we got this version
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
only sexual abuse in which physical
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
abuse was a contributing factor
 
03:55:03.359 --> 03:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
abuse was a contributing factor
this

03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:55:04.319 --> 03:55:05.670 align:start position:0%
this
version

03:55:05.670 --> 03:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
version
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
makes it
 
03:55:09.189 --> 03:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
its own independent
 
03:55:09.199 --> 03:55:10.469 align:start position:0%
its own independent
um

03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:13.429 --> 03:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
i i'm not a lawyer but
 
03:55:14.630 --> 03:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
it makes it
 
03:55:16.790 --> 03:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
open up to its own claim
 
03:55:16.800 --> 03:55:18.469 align:start position:0%
open up to its own claim
okay

03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:21.510 --> 03:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
all right so with that
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
do you have a question or are you
 
03:55:23.990 --> 03:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
raising your hand
 
03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:25.110 align:start position:0%
raising your hand
okay

03:55:25.110 --> 03:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:55:27.429 --> 03:55:27.439 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you think that we
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
should be adding physical abuse to the
 
03:55:32.070 --> 03:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
scope of claims
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
no no no no no no no no
 
03:55:41.750 --> 03:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:04.319 --> 03:56:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:56:08.150 --> 03:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if you're able to send us something
 
03:56:11.590 --> 03:56:11.600 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we can get all that to
 
03:56:13.830 --> 03:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
ols otherwise i think maybe we'll just
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
send what they have right now and then
 
03:56:16.630 --> 03:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
they can work from there i don't know
 
03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
what your time
 
03:56:19.269 --> 03:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
okay let me
 
03:56:47.670 --> 03:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
you have two different versions
 
03:56:50.790 --> 03:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
that look very similar
 
03:56:52.469 --> 03:56:52.479 align:start position:0%
yep yeah okay
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
she should have clarified
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay see there's a difference
 
03:57:00.710 --> 03:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
not not italicized italicized but other
 
03:57:03.030 --> 03:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
than that they look kind of similar yeah
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
so right can i see yeah what you've got
 
03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:06.950 align:start position:0%
so right can i see yeah what you've got
there

03:57:06.950 --> 03:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:57:08.469 --> 03:57:08.479 align:start position:0%
it might be this
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
this one lines up with this right that
 
03:57:12.710 --> 03:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
one lines up with my green markings over
 
03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:13.750 align:start position:0%
one lines up with my green markings over
here

03:57:13.750 --> 03:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
and where did this one come from just
 
03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
curious hand that out today
 
03:57:19.349 --> 03:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
so you know i assume from you guys i
 
03:57:21.110 --> 03:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't know this happened the last
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
meeting as well yeah no because then
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
long brought something in that also
 
03:57:26.070 --> 03:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
happened yeah this is just different
 
03:57:27.349 --> 03:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah because i see this all this
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
italicized well that's yours that's the
 
03:57:30.389 --> 03:57:30.399 align:start position:0%
good one
 
03:57:31.990 --> 03:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's the battle this is the one we
 
03:57:38.150 --> 03:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:40.070 --> 03:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
oh so you did italicize instead of the
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
you didn't keep the red lines in it i'm
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
just going to be careful this is the
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
second time we've had
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
documents that don't line up and i can't
 
03:59:08.550 --> 03:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:08.560 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
you
