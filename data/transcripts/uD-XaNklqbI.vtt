attention by um
 
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
my former police chief I have a
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
relationship because he was I was on the
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
Town Council when he was police chief of
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
marac but Mar Doyle is now the uh
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
director of emergency services and
 
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 align:start position:0%
communication for the Department of
 
00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and uh he brought these uh
 
00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
language updates to my attention I was
 
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
more than happy to to bring forward to
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh begin to codify what is already in
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
existence what already 911 is already
 
00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 align:start position:0%
doing um the um I did provide all of you
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
an email this morning and I provided
 
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
copies to the committee but uh in a
 
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
nutshell the proposed Bill clarifies the
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
language and the definition so that
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
existing protocols that are in place
 
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
right now are now going to be
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
statutorily allowed um the language
 
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
change also allows the
 
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
e911 uh the capability to continue
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
transferring those calls so that people
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
that are calling into 911 can get the
 
00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 align:start position:0%
access to the right right level of care
 
00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
that they need quickly um that really is
 
00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
the is the Genesis of it uh director
 
00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
Doyle is here today and I certainly
 
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
would defer to director Doyle and I
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
would amplify his testimony to you my
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues because he is the architect
 
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
he's worked closely um with members of
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
the mental health community members
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
within Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
Services um he's also worked with a with
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
a drafting attorney down at OLS to make
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the uh that the language in
 
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
this bill does indeed intend to uh
 
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
remedy uh as I said remedy the uh uh a
 
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
service that the state is already
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
providing so with that being said I will
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about can but
 
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise I certainly would defer to
 
00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
director Doyle to get granula with any
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
questions you may have and thank you Mr
 
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 align:start position:0%

bill um and I don't see any questions
 
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
we'll save them for the director okay
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%

advocacy on behalf of Nami New Hampshire
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to speak in support of
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:36.039 align:start position:0%
597 having been established in July of
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
2022 the uh New Hampshire's 988 crisis
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
and suicide um Lifeline is still
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
relatively new despite the state
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
investing in a very successful
 
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
promotional campaign uh there are still
 
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
some individuals who have either not
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
heard of 988 or when in crisis still
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
call 911 because that is what they are
 
00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
used to currently the 911 system has a
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
process in place to transfer Mental
 
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
Health crisis calls 2 988 centers when
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to do so this bill
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
would not change that practice it would
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
only uh codify this practice into state
 
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
law transferring these calls to 988
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense for several reasons
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
including freeing up 911 services for
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
higher level physical health and Public
 
00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:22.749 align:start position:0%
higher level physical health and Public
Safety

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
emergencies and also that 988 staff have
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
specialized training to work with people
 
00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
in a psychiatric crisis over the phone
 
00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
and have a close connection with
 
00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:34.309 align:start position:0%
and have a close connection with
Community

00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
Resources when individuals with mental
 
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
illness receive the right services at
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
the right place at the right time fewer
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
folks end up homeless hospitalized or
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
incarcerated all of which cost the state
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
far more than providing Community
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
Resources which is something that the
 
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
988 uh uh staff are able to to connect
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
folks with a majority of 988 calls do
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
not necessitate a mobile dispatch for
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
immediate assessment unlike 911 where
 
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:05.560 align:start position:0%
emergency services are always dispatched
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
many calls to 988 can be resolved over
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
the phone therefore money um are saved
 
00:08:15.629 --> 00:08:15.639 align:start position:0%
services and money are saved when the
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis calls get rooted to
 
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
988 rather than being responded to by
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
911 Mental Health crisis needs and
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
deserves a mental health
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
response uh this goal is supported by
 
00:08:29.149 --> 00:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
the current practices and should be
 
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
caught ified into law and for those
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
reasons Nami New Hampshire urges the
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee to vote ought to pass on House
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 597 I'll take any questions that
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
you may have thank you Mr St Could you
 
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
um could you give me an example of a of
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
a 988 call what one might be and how one
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
might be um resolved over the
 
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:53.000 align:start position:0%
phone yes um a lot of folks they might C
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
call in feeling um anxious or depressed
 
00:08:59.550 --> 00:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily having um suicidal
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
ideation that's life-threatening um so
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
they might need some resources they
 
00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
might need to be connected with a
 
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.360 align:start position:0%
therapist of their Community Mental
 
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
Health Center and those are um things
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
that folks can talk with them about also
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
too there are some times that folks are
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
having thoughts of suicide but don't
 
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
have a plan don't have the means um in
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
their access and so they might be able
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
to um do a safety plan with the person
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
to stay with family members um and then
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
connect them with um seeing somebody the
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
following day so that can happen too um
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
but uh when somebody when they do the
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and there is um a significant
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
of danger to the person or somebody else
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
they do um send out um a mobile crisis
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
worker to do an
 
00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
assessment you further
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
questions um representative
 
00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.990 align:start position:0%
questions um representative
Newman

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
Newman
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a quick question so
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
if I understand this correctly 911 now
 
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
currently makes that decision if they
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
get a call that is not required they
 
00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519 align:start position:0%
send it over and they can dial on 988 so
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
you haven't really changed a lot you're
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
just codifying that is that correct
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
that's correct and I will actually um
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
let um director Doyle answer that
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
question I think he's more qualified to
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
answer that question than I am but yes
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
lels thank you for taking my question
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
can you tell me as far as the the 988
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
operation how many people are typically
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
Manning that uh and is that a
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
247 uh operation it is a 247 operation I
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
would have to get back to you um and
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
contact Caroline as well as headrest to
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
find out how many folks are on at any
 
00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:54.519 align:start position:0%
given time but the way that the system
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
is designed is when the phone calls come
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
in they come into one of those um uh
 
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
organizations first if they're all uh
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
tied up with phone calls it will be
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
bounced to the other one and if those
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
folks are also tied up it will be
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
bounced to a uh another organization out
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
of state that will answer that call so
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
they are answered all calls are answered
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there might be um
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
nobody available in the state of New
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to answer those calls so they
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
are answered and they are answered
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
within one to two minutes of the
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
somebody's not on hold for more than
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
generally like one to two minutes um I
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
do know that um Jenny OA Higgins from
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
the Department is also here that might
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
have more um information on the exact
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
data if folks wanted that information on
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
the rates of answering the calls but
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
that's something also that I could get
 
00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
for you is is uh how many calls are
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
answered in state I think we're close to
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
the 90% Mark that uh samsa is asking
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
states to get to um that they're
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
answered in State versus being bound on
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
stat of state but all calls are answered
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
Muse any further questions
 
00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.629 align:start position:0%
Muse any further questions
representative

00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
PR so if I doubt this number does that
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
connect me to the crisis team because I
 
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
know I have a different number to get a
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
hold of the crisis team that comes out
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
will this do the same thing it will do
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
the same thing when new New Hampshire
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
launched its crisis um system before 988
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
was um in existence and then um before
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
there was Geo routing for phone calls um
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
if you had a didn't have a 603 phone
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
number it was bounced to and wherever
 
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
like I have a 207 it was bounced to
 
00:12:55.389 --> 00:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
Maine and to avoid um people
 
00:12:59.310 --> 00:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
being bounced out of state we provided
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
the 8 888 number to get a hold of so
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
that was for a local response only but
 
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
if if a 988 call comes into headrest who
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
does not dispatch mobile and mobile
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be dispatched they will do um a
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
call to carolon that does the uh mobile
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
work and we'll get that mobile uh
 
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
work and we'll get that mobile uh
dispatch

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
dispatch
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
going okay I think I understood
 
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
that thank you no further questions
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you the chair calls Mark

chairman and thank you all for giving me
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak to you today in
 
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
support of HB
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
597 establishing a designated Behavioral
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
Health Access Point within the enhan 911
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
system what we're doing really is to
 
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
clarify the the current process by which
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
we transfer calls from 911 to uh the
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
rapid response access point or the 988
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
seide prevention and crisis lifeline and
 
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the proposed legislative
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
changes to the enhanced 911 system
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
include a changes under the definitions
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
which is directed to clarify that
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
language and uh allow the transfer to
 
00:14:22.189 --> 00:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
the rapid response a access point so
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
that they are statutorily allowed
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
current language mentions specifically
 
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
that e911 can transfer Emer calls
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
directly to a public or private safety
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
agency and those are defined as
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
governmental or private entities which
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
provide emergency services including
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
police fire and emergency medical or
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
ambulance uh or ambulatory Services
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
since the onset of 988 though the
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
National Suicide Prevention and crisis
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
Lifeline e911 has worked closely with
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
to establish a transfer protocol to the
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
Statewide rapid response access point
 
00:14:57.749 --> 00:14:57.759 align:start position:0%
which is the 988 affiliate here in New
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this protocol has facilitated
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
transferring calls from the 911 Public
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
Safety answering point to the rapid
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
response access point for persons having
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
a mental health crisis allowing them to
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
get the right level of help at the right
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
time for their non-emergent behavioral
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
or mental health needs this clarifying
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
language codifies this Authority and
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
statute so e911 can connect people so
 
00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%
that they can again get the right level
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
of help at the right time without un
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
undo delay and again I want to thank you
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
all for the opportunity to speak to you
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill and hopefully we
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
can make sure that this is done so that
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
we can actually have this statutorily
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
authorized and move forward the folks
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
here that have already spoken in favor
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
of and in support of the bill
 
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
represented a number of constituencies
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh that we've worked very closely
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
together since the onset of 988 which
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
goes back to just about 2020 when we
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
started this process um and I think
 
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
we're at a very good point right now
 
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
where we're able to actually see some
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
success stories by which we've been able
 
00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
to transfer cause to 988 to date since
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
January of 2020 or since January of 2022
 
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
I should say we've facilitated warm
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
handoffs with 988 the rapid response
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
access point in the state almost 500
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
times those are 500 calls or callers
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
that would have otherwise been pointed
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
to a law enforcement response which
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily the right level of
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
help for those people in a mental health
 
00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:21.079 align:start position:0%
crisis again I want to thank you and I'm
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly available to answer any
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
questions that you might
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
have thank you
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
one thing I'm a little bit curious about
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
is is how exactly that works and for and
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
how you instruct
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
dispatchers because there are pretty
 
00:16:45.749 --> 00:16:45.759 align:start position:0%
serious consequences if you refer
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to a suicide or or mental
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
Crisis Prevention Hotline who should
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
have been referred to law enforcement
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
and and vice versa so what what is in
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
place right now to assure
 
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that happens correctly
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
and is there anything in this in the in
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
the bill that that's being proposed that
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
will ensure that that's being done
 
00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
better thank you for the question that's
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
a very good question and I always love
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
to take the opportunity to point out the
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
length and bread of training that our
 
00:17:17.949 --> 00:17:17.959 align:start position:0%
Public Safety telecommunicators go
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
through when
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
it's when it's their responsibility to
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
actually handle andriage appropriate
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
calls emergent and non-emergent calls in
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
the 911 call center as you know we go
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
through a Litany of training scenarios
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
both associated with the police fire and
 
00:17:36.029 --> 00:17:36.039 align:start position:0%
emergency calls as well as now with 911
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
or excuse me 988 and mental health
 
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
related Behavioral Health crisis calls
 
00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:42.679 align:start position:0%
that training spreads across about 16
 
00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:45.400 align:start position:0%
weeks of training before these folks are
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh in a position where they've been
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
approved to go out on their own having
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
said that what we had done and this is
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
done in concert was then in concert with
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
the folks from headrest with the folks
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
from at the time it was the uh rapid
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
response access point of Behavioral
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
Health crisis Services uh group from uh
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
carolon as well as our paap or Public
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
Safety answering Point supervisors and
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
chief of operations uh as well as the uh
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
senior staff here at 911 to make sure we
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
put in place a protocol that would
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
address those concerns exactly and we've
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
created in concert with emergency
 
00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
medical dispatch protocols a trios chart
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
which gives specific Clare guidance to
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
our telecommunicators when they handle a
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
call which alludes to or is directly
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
requested from the caller in the sense
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
that they need a a 988 or rapid response
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
Mental Health crisis related response
 
00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
and what they do is they actually go
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
through that triage chart to indicate or
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
ask questions and interview the caller
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
to find out if it is eligible for a warm
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
transfer some of those some of those
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
roots would show whether an individual
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
suggested that they were in a position
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
to harm themselves whether they had a
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
weapon whether they hadat threaten to
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
harm themselves whether we're actually
 
00:19:02.029 --> 00:19:02.039 align:start position:0%
in a crisis where they could hurt
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
somebody or anyone else whether they've
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
done it in the past or whether they have
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
a plan if that's the case those calls
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
are routed directly to a law enforcement
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
response because of the emergent nature
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
of the associated call if not those
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
calls are then handed off warmly to the
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
988 or rapid response access point call
 
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280 align:start position:0%
center so that they can actually have
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
that call handled by a mental health
 
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
counselor that doesn't end there though
 
00:19:27.149 --> 00:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm glad you brought up this
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
question I think clarifies how it work
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
works both ways in the event that that
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
call is transferred off and it turns
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
into a call that requires an emergeny
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
response where the mental health Council
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
has now determined because of things
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
that have been said or discussed over
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
the course of that discussion that
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
conversation that call can be
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
transferred back to 911 for an
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate emergent response and either
 
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
police fire or emergency medical or
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
combination of all three to respond and
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
handle a call in crisis mode in emergent
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
mode thank you you're welcome
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
um you've been obviously been doing this
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
now you're it's happening right now what
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
was the impetus to go ahead and put in
 
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
statute do you feel like there was some
 
00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:10.919 align:start position:0%
exposure that that perhaps not having it
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
in statute left us open to or what was
 
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
the thank you for the question and
 
00:20:17.789 --> 00:20:17.799 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question as we were
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
looking into what it was that we were
 
00:20:21.549 --> 00:20:21.559 align:start position:0%
doing in terms of the warm uh trans
 
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
transfers and the handoffs one of the
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
things that we started to do as a course
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
of what we always do when it comes to
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
rul making at the department of safety
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that our rules are
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the laws that we're
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
currently responsible for complying with
 
00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
and when we looked at the definition of
 
00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
what a private safety agency was we
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
realized in concert with our legal
 
00:20:43.789 --> 00:20:43.799 align:start position:0%
discussion and a legal team at
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety private safety
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
agency doesn't capture what 988 or rapid
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
response currently does in terms of a
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
non-emergent response so we needed to
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
make sure that we went back to the
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
drawing board so to speak and clarify
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
the language and statute so that it does
 
00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
comply with what the rule making says
 
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:03.400 align:start position:0%
and then we have to hopefully that this
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
passes hopefully we go back to Ru making
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
now to make sure that that's compliant
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
with the statute as it has changed and
 
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
been modified so again it's just a
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
matter of clarifying language to codify
 
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
exactly what it is that we're doing we
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
think we're doing a really good job at
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
it right now to make sure that we're
 
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
just walking in lock step with what it
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
is that we're required to do from a
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
rulemaking perspective as well okay so
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
there was no no National change or
 
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:27.640 align:start position:0%
movement or anything like that no good
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
um any yes representative
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
s thank you for taking my question um I
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
I think I have a pretty good grasp about
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
the 911 system but the 988 system um if
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
if it's a mental health situation you
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
transfer it to 988 does 988 ever
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
dispatch mental health professionals to
 
00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:56.549 align:start position:0%
dispatch mental health professionals to
the

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:59.470 --> 00:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
scene the answer is as my understanding
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
is yes they do if it warrants that type
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
of dispatch I would rather have me one
 
00:22:06.029 --> 00:22:06.039 align:start position:0%
of my partners from Health and Human
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
Services speak to what that workflow
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
works like they have folks that can
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
actually respond in the field they can
 
00:22:12.909 --> 00:22:12.919 align:start position:0%
set up followup appointments they can
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
work with the Community Mental Health
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
Centers of mobileal crisis response
 
00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
teams to do just that and they have I'm
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
sure that they have some success stories
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
on what that looks like as
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
well thank
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I do have written
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that I can pass
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
Higgins good morning chair and members
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Jenny O
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
Higgins I'm the legislative liaison for
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health at DHHS so we are here
 
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
today to provide some information on
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 597 as you've heard already
 
00:22:58.110 --> 00:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
from my colleagues we have been working
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
very closely on our 988 and rapid
 
00:23:02.909 --> 00:23:02.919 align:start position:0%
response system so in New Hampshire
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear a lot about if you
 
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:07.480 align:start position:0%
haven't already the DHHS road map and
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
our mission zero work our tenure Mental
 
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
Health Plan and children's system of
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
care so all of this is a part of these
 
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
goals essentially what we have learned
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
is that in best practices in Behavioral
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
Health crisis care there are three
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
pillars and those three pillers are
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
someone to talk to someone to respond
 
00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
and somewhere to go and so what we're
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
talking about today is that first pillar
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
of someone to talk to it's the call
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
centers and some of the questions that
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
I've heard today are kind of about that
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
someone to respond piece so in New
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today we have two call centers
 
00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:43.159 align:start position:0%
they answer the phone text and chat
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
24/7 and they operate both from the
 
00:23:49.269 --> 00:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
National Suicide and crisis Lifeline
 
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:51.640 align:start position:0%
that is a network of 200 centers across
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
the country and they we also have a
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
center as you had mentioned earlier
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative that is also answers in
 
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
833 3 710 6477 phone number the purpose
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
as I believe you heard earlier of
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
standing up a separate line was to make
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure that if you had an area code from
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
outside New Hampshire you would always
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
still reach a New Hampshire Center since
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
standing that up the FCC has approved
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
Geo routing in and so we are able to um
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
still reach a center closest to us now
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
from any area code but at the time that
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
was not true so that's the reason for
 
00:24:27.789 --> 00:24:27.799 align:start position:0%
the two phone numbers is that the longer
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
10 digit number you'll always get your
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire trained centers and with
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
988 you're you have the potential to
 
00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
reach the 200 centers that are in
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
network there the um the additional
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of being a part of that 988
 
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
suicide and crisis Lifeline though is as
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
you heard is if if the phone line is
 
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
tied up you will bounce to one of these
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
other trained centers and they have the
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
ability to get you resources in your
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
state as well and as you also heard many
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
calls are de-escalated by phone text in
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
chat so it's critically important that
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
there is someone to talk to um when
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
someone needs that Crisis Care so in
 
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:07.480 align:start position:0%
that partnership and through the work
 
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
that we've been doing in New Hampshire
 
00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
we have worked really closely with 911
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people are able to get
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
that appropriate response and um I
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
really just wanted to make sure to
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions for you all
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
today thank you you you said text so
 
00:25:26.389 --> 00:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
someone could text to 988 and say I need
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
to talk to someone and you could have a
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
whole conversation
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that's been critically
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
important especially for teens in New
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire our 14 to 17y old girls in
 
00:25:36.909 --> 00:25:36.919 align:start position:0%
particular who are accessing that and
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're also at an a risk of suicidal
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
ideation and so our data in New
 
00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire shows that that's a high-risk
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
group and that they're utilizing that
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
text modality does 911 also have that
 
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
capability we do we had the ab to
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
911 okay I know that we have we've got
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
the domestic line where where we
 
00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
encourage people to text if they're in
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
an unsafe place so I'm wondering if all
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
these things are all connected um so we
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
have our our domestic violence hotline
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
we have our mental health hotline we
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
have our emergent care hotline um what
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
else is there I know there's The Runaway
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
Teen line is that in any way affiliated
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
or no so in at this time we have been
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
working in partnership with with many
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
different crisis lines in New Hampshire
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
prior to standing up rapid response we
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
had over 30 phone numbers in New
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for Behavioral Health crisis
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
care so while it feels confusing that we
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
have two national 988 and rapid response
 
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually a significant progress
 
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
in the last five years because we had
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
ever crisis lines for all of our regions
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
and and we didn't have text and chat uh
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
modalities so we've made really
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
significant progress I think it would be
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
likely ideal to have one three-digit
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
phone number like 911 I know my children
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
are able to really describe easily you
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
know when when you need police fire and
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
ambulance you call 911 and when you're
 
00:27:04.269 --> 00:27:04.279 align:start position:0%
sad angry or overwhelmed you call 988
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
and have a generation growing up with
 
00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
that when we know that this is Su
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
suicide is a leading cause of death for
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
young people in our state that feels
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
like a really critical change for New
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the nation um so we're
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
moving towards a system that's going to
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
be better and better as we go um but
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're not necessarily fully there yet
 
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're in sort of our quality improvement
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
phase and we do still have the two phone
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
numbers um and we are promoting them
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
together in the same way so call either
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
we can get you the services you need if
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
you call 911 now we can get you to the
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
right level of you know service if it's
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health if you call 988 and
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's a 911 call that's why we have this
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration yeah that's great okay
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
Newman could you detail a little bit if
 
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
if someone calls with a Texas area code
 
00:27:55.389 --> 00:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
and then you get the call how does it do
 
00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
that does it do through location on the
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
phone or how does that yeah so Geo uh
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the Geo routing Works where they're they
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
ping the nearest cell tower like if
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
you're calling from a cell phone that's
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
pinging the nearest cell tower and
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
they're getting you a center that they
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
believe to be closest to you but you may
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
end up getting a Massachusetts Center or
 
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
something with the with the national
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
call center right but those 200 call
 
00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
centers in that 988 suicide and crisis
 
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
Lifeline are all trained to to and they
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
have a resource directory online for
 
00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
every state so they take the call that
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
they get if the caller is calling you
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
know from Texas and New Hampshire
 
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
answers they try to connect them to that
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
care in Texas and they do have that
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
resour that online resource directory um
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
but they don't they're not going to
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
transfer a caller who's in crisis
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
because there's a risk of losing the
 
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
call and so you take the call you get
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
and some and the there has been that
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
improvement with Geo routing whereas a
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
year ago you were only routed by your
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
area code so again we're sort of in this
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
we're kind of in the mud right now of
 
00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
making improvements to a system that's
 
00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
newer so we it would be ideal if it just
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
already worked like 911 but there was a
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
time where none of us had heard of that
 
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
either right so it is just a a newer
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
system follow follow
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
up so um there there's nothing right now
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
that recognizes the location of the
 
00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:26.120 align:start position:0%
phone from geolocation to to send the
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
call to the right place is that correct
 
00:29:30.909 --> 00:29:30.919 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it works as Geo routing which
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
pings the nearest cell tower geolocation
 
00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:35.919 align:start position:0%
is there's such a Nuance here in those
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
two terms but 911 is approved for
 
00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
geolocation where they can actually know
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
where the caller is located and for 988
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
it is to try to get you to your nearest
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
Center and some of the reason for that
 
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
Nuance at the federal level and the FCC
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
approval was that there were Advocates
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
who really wanted um people in suicidal
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
crisis to be able to remain somewhat
 
00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799 align:start position:0%
anonymous and so they didn't want the
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
location pieces um of course if there's
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
a crisis that where it is a rescue line
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
and if there's a crisis that needed a
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
911 uh we could transfer to them and
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
they would be able to utilize the
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
geolocation pieces of that um nationally
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
the data shows that less than 2% of call
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
text chats to 988 need any kind of
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
emergency response like that they really
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
need the someone to talk to thank you
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative lels
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
you may have just answered my question
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
but my question relates to a 988 call
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
that that is does not require 911
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
response but needs somebody on the scene
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
um how does that handled yes so those
 
00:30:49.549 --> 00:30:49.559 align:start position:0%
three pillars of Crisis Care again are
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
the someone to talk to and then someone
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
to respond and someone somewhere to go
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
so those are like our easiest ways of
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
describing what is obviously a comp
 
00:31:00.629 --> 00:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
system but what we have in New Hampshire
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
today is two call centers that can do
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
the someone to talk to we have 10 mobile
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
crisis teams operated through our
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers and
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
those mobile crisis teams can respond in
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
community again we're in the kind of
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce buildup and quality
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
improvement stages of that so ideally
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
they would be able to respond in
 
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
community 247 when that was necessary um
 
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.240 align:start position:0%
today that looks different depending on
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
the region and and the hiring rates and
 
00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
all of that within the that place but
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
they do have access to tella Health in
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
that way too for a CL a mental health
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
clinician to connect with someone and so
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 Community Mental Health Centers
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
are working through all of those issues
 
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
today and are able to respond in
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
community quite often it's about a
 
00:31:45.549 --> 00:31:45.559 align:start position:0%
quarter of calls that end up getting a
 
00:31:49.149 --> 00:31:49.159 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis response so 75% of calls
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
is I could get you exact data in email
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
if you want it but I'm just saying it
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head but um about 75%
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
of our calls in New Hampshire are are
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
de-escalated by phone and those that
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
need an in-person mental health response
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
that other quarter of um call calls are
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
able to get connected to those mobile
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
crisis teams and then we're piloting two
 
00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:13.159 align:start position:0%
crisis stabilization centers in Dover
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
and lonia Dover is open and lonia is
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
soon to be open and that's that third
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
pillar so that's sort of where we're at
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
in the middle of building a Behavioral
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
Health crisis system in New Hampshire
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman follow up what sort
 
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
of cover do you have for Coos County uh
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
so the mental health center there has a
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis team and I would have to
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
go back to ask their Staffing ratio
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
today I know that that's that's
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
obviously a place where there has been
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenges across the board
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
not just in Behavioral Health but they
 
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:46.639 align:start position:0%
do have a mobile crisis team I would
 
00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
just have to ask them how their Staffing
 
00:32:52.269 --> 00:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
was going do you know where they're
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
based I could get back too on it I'm so
 
00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you representative new
 
00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:00.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you so much
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I think it's
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
in line with what representative lales
 
00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
was saying um but a little bit deeper in
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I've had the pleasure of getting to
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
know the the mobile crisis team in the
 
00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
mannok region um out of Manu uh family
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
services and so my what I hope would or
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
think would be clarifying is to explain
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
what it looks like what a mobile crisis
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
unit actually shows up uh goes out um uh
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
and what that looks like when they
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
respond as opposed to um especially as
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know when if police
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
showed up or you know what I mean what
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
what exactly would that look like yeah
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
so what we we have a couple of different
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
types of sort of certifications we have
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
a crisis certification we have and then
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
we have clinicians that can be a part of
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
that team and then we have peers that
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
can be a part of that team so peer
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
support services is someone who has
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
experienced a mental health um condition
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
of their own and so they're able to and
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
they have you know training and can
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
offer recovery supports and so typically
 
00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:00.519 align:start position:0%
a clinician or a crisis trained
 
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
counselor and a peer go out as a team
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
and they can sit with that individual
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
and um you know be in that space with
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
them and have that kind of training
 
00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:11.599 align:start position:0%
that's specific to mental health it can
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes be really intimidating to have
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know folks in a uniform with a badge
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
kind of show up when you're in a mental
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
health crisis there's such a critical
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
need for all of our First Responders
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a fourth first responder
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
right we've got police fire and
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
ambulance and then we've got mental
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
health uh crisis counselors that can sit
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
with you in that time of need and be
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
able to have that specialty training and
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
we recognize that they there's not the
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
medical piece of having you know an EMT
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
on the scene and we that's why the
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
partnership or the we not the law
 
00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement you know it's the it's that
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
we all can partner to get the right
 
00:34:49.149 --> 00:34:49.159 align:start position:0%
response when it's needed so if someone
 
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
is at in imminent risk and or if if
 
00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's homicidal or suicidal idation
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
and the person is um has means and it
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's an at risk we're going
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
to partner with those with our other
 
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
three First Responders right we're going
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
to send police fire and ambulance to a
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
life saving situation but when we know
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
that 75% of these calls are de-escalated
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
by phone and then we can connect people
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
to same day next day appointments or to
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
ongoing Mental Health Care um that's
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
life-saving too it looks different right
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
than the way that we could see saving a
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
life when um there's a someone has a
 
00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
heart attack right but but it is it's
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
Having the courage and the language to
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
sit with someone in crisis that can save
 
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
their life and can I ask one quick
 
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
followup so out of the uh mental health
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
our our Regional Mental Health um um
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
community centers how many are kind of
 
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
at the level that that is possible I I
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
know you were saying they're in various
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
stages and and I acknowledge that manok
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
is probably at a different stage and Le
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
the other ones I'm just yeah so I I
 
00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely know that my director of the
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
mental health Bureau would be able to
 
00:36:01.309 --> 00:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
answer you on the spot about the
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
Staffing of each of those teams I just
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't have that information so I'm happy
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
to email it to the committee but we had
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
you know in conquered Manchester and
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
NASA these teams have been operational
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
for longer in the in those cities and so
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
they are up you know up and running and
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
responding to many many calls and in
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
some of the regions especially that are
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
more rural like I was saying earlier
 
00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
there's Workforce challenges in every
 
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
sector and and Behavioral Health is no
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
exception and so there are times where
 
00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
those teams may not be fully staffed
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
they do always still have access to the
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
telea health and then we are working you
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
know very part of standing up a crisis
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
counselor certification is to actually
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can expand that
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce and um we're also looking at
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
all kinds of creative and alternative
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
methods and I really think about it a
 
00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
lot as how you know Manchester has 200
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters but a rural region is going
 
00:36:58.510 --> 00:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
to have a volunteer apartment and so we
 
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
need to get creative and um and
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be just being able to
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
sit with someone in crisis and talk with
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
them and so there are probably a lot of
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
different ways that New Hampshire can
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
figure out how to respond to this as
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
long as you've got some training right
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
and so that's there's so many different
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
ways that we're working towards how do
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
we build this Workforce so that we can
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
save the lives of our friends and
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
neighbors um and I think New Hampshire
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
is so good at that so sorry I'm so wordy
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
it's okay you thank you for uh talking
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
to us this morning absolutely is there
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%

introduce HB 602 relative to proposed

Public Safety legislation that would add
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
a requirement for completion of an

one of us is unaware of the challenges

our law enforcement officers are facing
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
as they try to address the very real and
 
00:51:52.789 --> 00:51:52.799 align:start position:0%
very problematic issue of impaired
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
driving in New
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can't turn on the news
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
without learning of another accident or
 
00:52:01.990 --> 00:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
fatality with impaired drivers often
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
behind the wheel or pick up a
 
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:07.640 align:start position:0%

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%

same time protecting the public at large
 
00:52:20.109 --> 00:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
from becoming innocent victims must feel
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
like an ex an exercise and futility some
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
days for law enforcement HB 602 would
 
00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
provide an additional
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
program tool for New Hampshire law
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%

related offenses decrease offender
 
00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:36.799 align:start position:0%
recidivism and save lives the impetus
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
for this bill came by way of a telephone
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
call from my local police chief Brian
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
Lake not as a request for legislation
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
but rather to share information and his
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
own experience with what I've heard for
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%

you look at the bill you will see that
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
HB 602 would require DUI offenders to
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
compete complete the online Victim
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%

within the bill using you impact an
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
online Victim Impact Panel program that

multiple New Hampshire towns it's the
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
gold standard program model Chief Roy is
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
an excellent resource for specific
 
00:53:49.069 --> 00:53:49.079 align:start position:0%
information about the U IMPACT program
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
and current New Hampshire participation
 
00:53:53.829 --> 00:53:53.839 align:start position:0%
I want to be clear um as you will note
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
references you impact act or any other
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
program by name rather should HB 602 be
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
considered favorably by the committee
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
any program that could meet the
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
requirements included within the
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
definition of a qualified online Victim
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
Impact Panel program would be eligible
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%

um those were some suggestions that um

and uh certain phraseology that uh was
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
felt to improve it um I believe it's
 
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
time to put another tool in our Public
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
Safety toolbox and if we have the
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
ability to positively impact outcomes
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
for both DUI offenders and potential
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
victims and this comes at no cost to the
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
state or County I hope you'll agree that
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
we should at least be willing to try I'm
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but as the
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
Chiefs will be speaking as well not the
 
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:13.400 align:start position:0%
ones whose hopes were dashed by the
 
00:55:16.230 --> 00:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
Eagles on Sunday uh it may make sense to
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
see if they're answered during their
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I ask that you please support
 
00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
HB 602 and send it to the floor with an
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um there's no charge to the
 
00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:30.680 align:start position:0%
state or county is there a charge to the
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
offender there's a $100 charge to the
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
offender and if they're declared
 
00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
determined to be Indigent by the court
 
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
the um right now the program that is
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
available you impact uh will absorb that
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
cost so it remains available to to the
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
to the uh to the individual okay thank
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
you see enough further questions thank
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Denise Roy the chair calls
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
know um I want to good morning everyone

me to be here today to discuss the
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill and that could help save
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
lives in New Hampshire uh a special
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative Murphy uh
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
for recognizing that we can do more to
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
reduce the rate of re ISM of impaired
 
00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:30.680 align:start position:0%
drivers in our state my name is Denise
 
00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh again last name Roy I a New Hampshire
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
native who grew up in Nashua for over 30
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
years I devoted my career though it felt
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
hardly felt like a work day when you
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
love what you do um to serving the
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
citizens of marac as a police officer uh
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
I retired in 2000 as the chief of police
 
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
during my time in law enforcement I
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
witnessed both the incredible resilience
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
of humanity and the devastating impacts
 
00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:58.630 align:start position:0%
of humanity and the devastating impacts
of

00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
tragedy While most of my experiences
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
were rewarding none haunts me more than
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
those related to impaired driving for
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
those of you on the committee who have
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
similar experiences you know that
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
informing a parent family member or
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
friend that their loved one has been
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
killed by a drunk driver is a burden
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
that stays with you forever what makes
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
it worse is that these tragedies are
 
00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.549 align:start position:0%
it worse is that these tragedies are
entirely

00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
preventable in New Hampshire we see
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
around 5,000 driving while intoxicated
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
AR rest each year this number only
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
reflects those that have been caught we
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
know the actual number of impaired
 
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:37.799 align:start position:0%
drivers is much higher as a police
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
officer it was frustrating to see that
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
after a person is arrested for impaired
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
driving and leaves the police station
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
they're often just
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
forgotten while various resources are
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated to prevention and enforcement
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is much more that can be done post
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
arrest the purpose of my presence here
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
today is to emphasize that we can take
 
00:57:59.309 --> 00:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
additional steps across the country many
 
00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:00.920 align:start position:0%
states require individuals facing
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
impaired driving charges to attend a
 
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:05.720 align:start position:0%
Victim Impact Panel unfortunately these
 
00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
types of panels are not widely known or
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
utilized in New Hampshire or New England
 
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:10.870 align:start position:0%
utilized in New Hampshire or New England
in

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
general our traditional Victim Impact
 
00:58:15.789 --> 00:58:15.799 align:start position:0%
Panel consists of two to three speakers
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
that have been affected by impaired
 
00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:19.839 align:start position:0%
driving they share stories about their
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
loved ones and their personal
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
experiences with these
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
tragedies I've attended and participated
 
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
in Victim Impact panels to gain a better
 
00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
understanding of what an effective
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
program looks like although my
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
attendance was not mandatory I still had
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
an emotional response to what I
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
experienced I Now understand how a
 
00:58:42.349 --> 00:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
program like these can reveal the Ripple
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
effects of one's actions an effective
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
Victim Impact Panel should aim to
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
influence participants on an emotional
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
level changing their attitudes towards
 
00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
impaired driving and reducing likelihood
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
of defending importantly these panels
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
should not be designed to shame judge or
 
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:03.880 align:start position:0%
lecture instead they should help impair
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
drivers understand the ripple effect of
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
their choices and encourage behavioral
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
change participants in panels
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
participation in panels is crucial if
 
00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
individuals are only forced to sit and
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
listen they are likely to disengage
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging involvement through
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
questions answers and self-reflection
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
fosters a better understanding of the
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
consequence of their
 
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:28.910 align:start position:0%
consequence of their
actions

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
moreover it is essential that these
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
panels feature speakers with diverse
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
experiences related to impaired driving
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in the justice
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
system may not connect with the victim's
 
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
story uh but they may find themselves in
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
hearing from someone who has faced
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
similar struggles programs with varied
 
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
speakers can be more relatable to
 
00:59:50.029 --> 00:59:50.039 align:start position:0%
impaired drivers ultimately the choice
 
00:59:53.309 --> 00:59:53.319 align:start position:0%
to drive impaired is just that a choice
 
00:59:55.270 --> 00:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
when individuals are led to place of
 
00:59:57.309 --> 00:59:57.319 align:start position:0%
acceptance and resp responsibility they
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
can make safer choices for themselves
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
creating a positive ripple effect that
 
01:00:04.069 --> 01:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
extends beyond what they might see
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
mandating attendance at a Victim Impact
 
01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:08.039 align:start position:0%
Panel can make a significant difference
 
01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
in reducing the recidivism rate in New
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the cost of the state is zero
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
our commitment to the citizens of this
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
great state is invaluable how can we
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
Overlook such an essential tool that
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.109 --> 01:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
before thank you Chief can you tell tell
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
me um where else this program is in use
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
that you've seen it and what your
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
thoughts are after having observed
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
it so the first part of the question is
 
01:00:38.109 --> 01:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
it's in use in um it's being utilized in
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
every state in the country some states
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
utilize it more than other states uh
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
depending upon the um the the law that's
 
01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
currently in effect uh so two of the
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
larger states that utilize specifically
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
the program that um I advocate for um
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
are Florida and Texas and they're um
 
01:00:57.630 --> 01:00:57.640 align:start position:0%
used entirely in the State um but like I
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
said it's it's utilized throughout every
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
single state um and and I have to um I
 
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
attended both a live Impact Panel
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
because those um pre-co were very
 
01:01:10.829 --> 01:01:10.839 align:start position:0%
popular and that's what everybody did um
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
this the program I advicate for uh was
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
developed in 2011 um so I took the
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
online program first but to make sure I
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
understood what I was advocating for I
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to go to a live Impact Panel um
 
01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:24.200 align:start position:0%
they're completely different the
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
atmosphere on an online panel is
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
although you're some people think you
 
01:01:29.829 --> 01:01:29.839 align:start position:0%
don't want the defendant to feel
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable but you do because that's
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
how they're going to understand and
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
that's how they're going to to interact
 
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:37.079 align:start position:0%
and when I took the course I found
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
myself um thinking 30 years in law
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement there's no way that I'm
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to feel emotional after seeing and
 
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
doing what I've done but I was sitting
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
at my kitchen counter and I was crying
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
because I was like this is truly people
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
don't understand that ripple effect that
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
their decisions have on others
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
um so it was much the the online online
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
was much it allowed me to feel that as
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to the live panel um I was in a
 
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
room with over a hundred people I felt
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
shame and I wasn't even there I was it
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
wasn't mandatory for me there I felt
 
01:02:13.950 --> 01:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
shame uh and it just you know it wasn't
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere for me to makes you more
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
guarded yes absolutely guarded I didn't
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
know who I was sitting next to nobody
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know people were being kicked out
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
people were talking there were two
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
speakers and they had horrific stories
 
01:02:27.309 --> 01:02:27.319 align:start position:0%
they've lost loved ones there's no you
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
can't you know you you have empathy for
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
that but you're not absorbing what you
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
should be absorbing in a Victim Impact
 
01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
Panel thank you the the second part of
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
the question was so Florida and Texas um
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
have they had demonstrable drops in
 
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.910 align:start position:0%
have they had demonstrable drops in
their

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
reivisa or is there any way to tie that
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
to this no there there absolutely is um
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
the company the organization you impact
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
that I work for who actually uh I have
 
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the person who has all the answers but I
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
do know this one um so there was a a
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
recidivism study done and there was
 
01:03:01.269 --> 01:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
Nationwide through um the Transportation
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
safety agency and at the time of the
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
study the national recidivism rate was
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
25% um the recidivism study done just by
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
you impact on um two counties in Florida
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
Miami Dade County which is one of the
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
largest counties and Duval County um it
 
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
was the the recidivism rate was 3.9 in
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
Miami Dade and 2.9 in Duval County so
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's a significant drop and um and
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
again that's only those people who
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
participated in the U IMPACT Program um
 
01:03:33.029 --> 01:03:33.039 align:start position:0%
there certainly are studies you know
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
that that question um the effectiveness
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
of them however the people and and we've
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
seen I have testimonials of people who
 
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
have actually taken the course in New
 
01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:44.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have worked with a couple of
 
01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
the prosecutors for cases that were
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
pledged from DWI um and they have taken
 
01:03:51.269 --> 01:03:51.279 align:start position:0%
the course and I do believe you have um
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
that in your packet um the testimonials
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
of the people who have it it actually
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
works CU they understand what the ripple
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
effect is from what they've
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
done final question for me is this
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
program mandatory in Texas in
 
01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:11.640 align:start position:0%
Florida yes okay thank you um
 
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.349 align:start position:0%
Florida yes okay thank you um
representable

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
representable
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
sales thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh those recid recidivis rates uh that
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
that that's tremendous when you talk
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
about impaired driving
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
um are you just looking at alcohol or
 
01:04:34.029 --> 01:04:34.039 align:start position:0%
are there other uh forms of abuse well
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
the drug drug driving is obviously um a
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
new it's newer into the driving well
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
impaired um realm uh so are the are the
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
you IMPACT Program um does just deal
 
01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:49.160 align:start position:0%
right now with alcohol related drunk
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
driving um but obviously with changing
 
01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
of laws you have to consider changing
 
01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
also the stories um to include drugged
 
01:04:59.910 --> 01:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
driving as well followup Mr chairman
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
follow um I'm just wondering uh
 
01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
distracted driving is really in a crisis
 
01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
level here in New Hampshire does this
 
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
program cover that at
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
all well I would say yes it could but
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
the only um caveat to that would
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
be the the stories of the real life
 
01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
victim and defendant that you hear in
 
01:05:27.309 --> 01:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
our all are surrounded by alcohol
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
impairment however that being said
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
anytime it is also a form of distracted
 
01:05:35.029 --> 01:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
driving um so anytime that you can make
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
somebody feel and understand um why
 
01:05:41.029 --> 01:05:41.039 align:start position:0%
their behaviors should change then it to
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
me it's it's just as effective again I
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
attended both of these not because it
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
was mandatory but because I wanted to
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
experience it and it was life-changing
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
for me and I I'm not even you know this
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
it's not something that I had to do one
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.029 --> 01:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
um where I live we have a front porch
 
01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.079 align:start position:0%
we're able to look down on a state
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
highway where the speed limit is 40
 
01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
miles hour and it's amazing how many of
 
01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
the people that are going by that are
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
looking on their cell phones and it's
 
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:22.480 align:start position:0%
particularly bad among young females
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
that they seem to constantly be on their
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
their phones I'm just wondering do you
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
have any Outreach into the school system
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
the driver's head programs and so
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
forth so the U IMPACT Program
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
specifically um has what we call a Pay
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
It Forward program and the participants
 
01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
um the people who who have to take the
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
course it's mandatory for them to take
 
01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
the course um are are granted access to
 
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
this onehour pay it for program although
 
01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
it it concentrates on um alcohol
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
impairment um it can also be used for
 
01:07:03.549 --> 01:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
distracted driving situations um it's a
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
free program that um we provide to
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants it it's it's kind of
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
the impact's way of of trying to do
 
01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
something preventative instead of being
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
reactionary um so that is a program that
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
that is used in some facilities
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
especially um Juvenile Detention
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
facilities uh specifically in California
 
01:07:26.549 --> 01:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
they utilize our program um in one
 
01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:30.799 align:start position:0%
specific County for for those types of
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
situations representative BRS thank you
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm just I I have a
 
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:37.630 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm just I I have a
question

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
about the cost in the mention of you
 
01:07:42.190 --> 01:07:42.200 align:start position:0%
know if the person is found Indigent
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to pay however if a
 
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
person does have the ability to pay that
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
then they do so I'm trying to figure out
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
is it right to make a person pay for it
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
but then not to make an another would it
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
just not be better to just if the
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
program is going to be free for some
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
people just to be free for
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
all well no I no I do disagree with that
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
part of it um I do think you know the
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
the programming cost um is I'm trying to
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
think my colleague might be a better
 
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
person to answer this question um the
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
indigency is to like if a person is
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
charged if a defendant goes to court and
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
they would like a public defender um
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
those are the the types of case Indigent
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
cases that are also
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um that that that the courts would give
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
us they would say this person's been
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
indent through the paperwork that they
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
do so it's similar to any other program
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
or any other sentence that somebody has
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
um that the the program is there's a fee
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
to it um you know there's no way to get
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
around that unless unless the state were
 
01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
going to um you know pay out a
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
predetermined amount I mean that it's a
 
01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%

across the State of
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
Florida about once a month and she over
 
01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
time became to realize that this was the
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
hardest thing she ever had to do was to
 
01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
Speak Life to people to relive the worst
 
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:18.280 align:start position:0%
experience of her life and so at the
 
01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion of a couple probation
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
officers who knew her well enough to say
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
we want to share your story but we just
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to ask you to speak again she
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
developed the U IMPACT
 
01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
program she knew the other speakers um
 
01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
Anna was best known for her storytelling
 
01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
if you ever want to access the program
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
we always can give you access and you'll
 
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
see what a wonderful speaker she was she
 
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:41.550 align:start position:0%
see what a wonderful speaker she was she
was

01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
non-judgmental she understood that if
 
01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
people are sitting in a place of fear
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
and anger they'll never listen to your
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
message they need to feel safe and they
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
need to understand that they have the
 
01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
ability to make better choices moving
 
01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
forward as a company we that's what we
 
01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
believe in everybody deserves the chance
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
to do better when they know better
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
they'll do better we've had close to
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
55,000 people across the country take
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
this program um one of my jobs is I
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
quickly read all the letters as they
 
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
come in at the end of the program we ask
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
people to write to
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
themselves saying what they want to do
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
better moving forward how they can do
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
better moving forward um consistently
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
people will say I didn't realize my
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
choice could affect somebody
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
else and I mean as we're all sitting
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
here it's safe to say we've made good
 
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
decisions in our life we've had people
 
01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
who have encouraged us to make great
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
choices a lot of people don't have that
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
so of those 55,000 people the common
 
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
message is I didn't understand that the
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
choice to drive drunk was going to
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
impact everybody and so generally what
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
we want people to realize is that they
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
need to forgive themselves they need to
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
make a better choice moving forward
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's common sense for us but
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
not everybody having an Uber a
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
designated driver drinking at home not
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
drinking we just we want people to
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
realize that impair driving is a choice
 
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so that's how we model our
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
business thank you welcome represent n
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm curious and
 
01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
I'm curious if there are people who um
 
01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
might participate in this or or who
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
might also share their story in one way
 
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
or another of um kind of overcoming that
 
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
or reform um and so I was just curious
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
if that's a part of it as well or if
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's yes so we have two speakers in the
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
program um one was a child and her
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
father she was in car accidents with her
 
01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
father drunk driving and so she's made
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
it her life mission to connect with
 
01:12:48.390 --> 01:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
other victims and kind of help them move
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
forward um we have another speaker in
 
01:12:53.149 --> 01:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
our program who her DUI was a wakeup
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
call that she was also battling
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
addiction and now she runs a rehab day
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%

Murphy not just because she represents
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
my parents in marac and I see that I
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
just headed off the police officer that
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
protects my parents in marac um but she
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
she brought a very broad group of people
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
together to take a look at the bill um
 
01:13:34.189 --> 01:13:34.199 align:start position:0%

01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
brief um I just want to let you know
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
that I did participate in the program I
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
took the online course and I've been a
 
01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
police officer for 26 years um have had
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
to deliver those messages of someone's
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
passing and I can tell you that as soon
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
as I took this program I immediately
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
felt impacted by it um it truly is wide
 
01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
ranging when you're talking about the
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
offenders the victims and that ripple
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
effect that you don't really think about
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
when you're making those actions when
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing them you know 20 years
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
after where people still medical bills
 
01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:57.400 align:start position:0%
that are racking up that aren't being
 
01:14:59.709 --> 01:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
paid by Insurance um personally I
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
thought it was very very impactful and
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's why I reel to representative
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
Murphy who's done a phenomenal job
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
Gathering all the stakeholders and
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
trying to present what I think is a is a
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
great bill so I just want to say I
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
personally uh took the program and I
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
think it's well worthwhile even if it
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
can get you know five out of 10 you know
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
half people have changed their behaviors
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%

387 good morning Mr chairman members of
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
the committee um thank you for hearing
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill today I thought it was going
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
to go to environment and agriculture but
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
because there are penalties involved I
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
think that's why it came here um my name
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
is Janet wall I'm State Rep been here 20
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
terms and I've never filed a frivolous
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
Bill and there have been all kinds of
 
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:16.040 align:start position:0%
comments made about the balloon bill but
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
this is a serious matter uh this bill
 
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
has come before us in the house before
 
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2007 and passed the house on
 
01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote on consent it went to the
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
Senate and that's where it died because
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
the bill at that time focused only on
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
penalties not on education or anything
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
else um I'm sponsoring this bill on
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent who asked me for
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
three years in a row to please do
 
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
something and I honestly am embarrassed
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
to say perhaps that I didn't take it
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
seriously because it had died before but
 
01:22:51.750 --> 01:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
he's a very well-respected businessman
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
who goes out deep sea fishing when he's
 
01:22:56.229 --> 01:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
able to have time off from work when
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
he's in the state and he showed me late
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
this last summer a massive pile of
 
01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
balloons I'm 55 A2 that balloon pile of
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
balloons was taller than I am and as
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
wide as his table that he had pulled up
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
just from that weekend alone being off
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
the coast of New Hampshire uh he said
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
This is Not Unusual this happens and
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
I've heard about it from other people
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I have never seen the evidence and
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry he couldn't be here today he
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
is out of state
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
but once he showed me that I thought
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
we've got a problem and we need to do
 
01:23:31.149 --> 01:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
something about it and it's not only New
 
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I have with me and um if
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
you need back up I need the original
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
bill from back in 2007 and all the
 
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
background information on testimony
 
01:23:42.830 --> 01:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
votes and this that and the other um I
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
have that to share with you if you need
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
it um I have the amendment that came in
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
at that time um and I have copies of all
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
the laws from the 10 other states that
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
have passed this bill um the most recent
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
state was
 
01:24:02.189 --> 01:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
Florida and prior to it passing in
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
Florida and again I've got the copies if
 
01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
you need these if you don't I'll hang on
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
to them prior to that new uh the New
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
York Times had an article I'll only read
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
part of it to you balloons released in
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the sky don't go to heaven they often
 
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
end up in oceans and waterways where
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
there and I don't know if this number is
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
accurate 32 times more are likely to
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
kill seabirds and other types of plastic
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
debris is found among the balloons um
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
balloons contribute to the increase in
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
micras plastic pollution which is
 
01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
harmful to every living creature and we
 
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
all know that from what we've been going
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
through in recent years up here as well
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not only the sea creatures that are
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
being damaged by it but the environment
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
is well uh living here in New Hampshire
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
I I come from a family of mountain
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
climbers when we're able to and um doing
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
the 4,000 Footers in numerous times not
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
we found litter in our beautiful
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
mountains but we found balloons just a
 
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
few months ago um I was not able to get
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
to this area where I found a cluster of
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
six or seven at least maybe eight
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
Balloons all tied together in a tree a
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
mile from my house where they came from
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know years ago we found a
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
balloon in our yard with a little note
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
on it from somebody down in Pennsylvania
 
01:25:21.189 --> 01:25:21.199 align:start position:0%
wanting us to get in touch with them and
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
say where the balloon had finally landed
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
um these things drift around we don't
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
know where they're going to land we
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen we
 
01:25:30.229 --> 01:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't know about what animals are going
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
to ingest them and what's going to
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
happen to those animals fish are
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
affected um they did I think it's called
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
an acopy on a whale and determined that
 
01:25:42.109 --> 01:25:42.119 align:start position:0%
it had ingested some balloons and it had
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
an intestinal blockage from the strings
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
or the ribbons whatever they were
 
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
connecting all those balloons um birds
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
get caught and and I've got pictures I
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
can show you if you need um birds get
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
caught in the uh W excuse me in the
 
01:26:01.030 --> 01:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
strings and in the ribbons that tie
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
these balloons together I have two
 
01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
pictures of birds that have been tied up
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
like that um it does happen this is
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
important what I'm asking for in this
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill is different from what the bill
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
asked for in 2007 again that Bill had
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support from the house
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
it passed on the consent calendar Voice
 
01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
vote went into the Senate but all it
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
called for was penalties I'm not doing
 
01:26:27.149 --> 01:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
that yes there's a penalty attached to
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
this as you'll see in the bill as you
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
read it but what it's asking for is when
 
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
these bills when these balloons are sold
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
put a tag on them just put a little tag
 
01:26:38.669 --> 01:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
on that says these do uh cause hazards
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
to the environment and to Wildlife
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
Wildlife on the land as well as in the
 
01:26:44.910 --> 01:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
sea just put a little tag on it to warn
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
people about that and actually um
 
01:26:49.430 --> 01:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
someone said well this is going to hurt
 
01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
the balloon industry it's not going to
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
hurt the balloon industry people still
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
love balloons and decorate with with
 
01:26:57.990 --> 01:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
them and such um the T the store of
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
Market Basket sells balloons and they
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
sell them with a clip or weight on the
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
bottom of them that's all you really
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
need also you can put that tag on the we
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
you can put it on the string just have
 
01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
it somewhere but it reminds people just
 
01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
don't let these things go it's a lot of
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
fun watching balloons go up in the
 
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
sky but what goes up does come down and
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
there are consequences to this um I'm
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
asking that if you take this seriously
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I have come to the point where I am
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
taking it seriously now put a tag on the
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
balloons when they're sold it's not
 
01:27:34.629 --> 01:27:34.639 align:start position:0%
going to hinder marketing at all it's
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
not going to stop the balloon industry
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
from producing balloons it's not going
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
to hurt enforcement one of the problems
 
01:27:43.149 --> 01:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
with the other bill that uh failed in
 
01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
the senate in 2007 was it relied on Fish
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
and Game to handle all this I I can't do
 
01:27:51.629 --> 01:27:51.639 align:start position:0%
that to that agency we all know it's the
 
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
least funded uh agency Department in our
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
state and they're already burdened with
 
01:27:58.750 --> 01:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
all the search and rescue efforts they
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
make all year long up in the mountains
 
01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
um this is so that any law enforcement
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
officer can issue a ticket you know
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're violating the law um you're not a
 
01:28:11.149 --> 01:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
criminal but there is a violation here
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
and make people aware that this is a
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
serious issue um I was at a funeral for
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
a newborn baby a few years ago it was
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of the saddest things I've ever
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
attended and at theend and we were all
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
at the cemetery and we were all handed
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
little note cards to write so we did not
 
01:28:32.350 --> 01:28:32.360 align:start position:0%
knowing what the consequences were be
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
next thing we knew hundreds of balloons
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
were passed out we were to attach these
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
notes to the balloons and send them off
 
01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:41.560 align:start position:0%
into the sky um I had a really hard time
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
doing that I really did because we all
 
01:28:46.310 --> 01:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
know that again what goes up does come
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
down um I asked for you to take this
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
very seriously the states that have
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
passed the law that this is invi
 
01:28:59.310 --> 01:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
California Connecticut Rhode Island
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
Delaware Tennessee Virginia Hawaii Maine
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland and Florida is the most recent
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
one there are a number of municipalities
 
01:29:12.189 --> 01:29:12.199 align:start position:0%
that have also passed ordinances so that
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
people won't release balloons places
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
like Louisville Kentucky The Hamptons
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
New York rville North Carolina galston
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
Texas and Bainbridge Island Washington
 
01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
and other communities have done on that
 
01:29:27.430 --> 01:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
as well um people are beginning to be
 
01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
aware that balloons really become trash
 
01:29:34.229 --> 01:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
they don't just evaporate we need to be
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
aware that there's a way to dispose of
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
these responsibly if you want balloons
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
okay decorate with them there's a way to
 
01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
decorate you've seen balloon arches just
 
01:29:45.189 --> 01:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
like arches with flowers and such if you
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
want to um scatter something uh someone
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
suggested scatter rose petals or
 
01:29:53.149 --> 01:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
something but don't have it so you have
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
particles of plastic or going into the
 
01:29:59.709 --> 01:29:59.719 align:start position:0%
ocean and into the environment so again
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's a way to manage this it's just
 
01:30:04.189 --> 01:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
good common sense and asking that you
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
take this seriously and please uh
 
01:30:09.070 --> 01:30:09.080 align:start position:0%
consider passing it again ton of the
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
states have done it we had it before
 
01:30:14.350 --> 01:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
without um the steps for
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
Education all we had was a penalty
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
before which I don't think ever worked
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
for anything I mean when we're raising
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
our children we just don't have
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
penalties we offer options for better
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
behavior and hopefully that's what
 
01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:30.199 align:start position:0%
happens here um thank you very
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you any
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
questions repr
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
amuse have you seen the the pictures of
 
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the seabirds that are posted on the US
 
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
fish and wildlife site uh that have been
 
01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
killed by balloons and STS somewhere in
 
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
all these papers I have a picture or two
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
of them and yeah they do get tangled up
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much it it does
 
01:30:53.639 --> 01:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much it it does
happen

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative new thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
so I I wonder if you think that the um
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
educational piece around this is to a
 
01:31:09.470 --> 01:31:09.480 align:start position:0%
point where it makes sense to have
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
consequences can you repeat that please
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
I wonder if you think that the awareness
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
and educational piece of letting people
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
know that this is you know that they're
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
this is harmful to our environment for
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
example you know we used to do this for
 
01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh people who had lost someone to
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
overdose we would do the black balloons
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we would release that my kids used
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
to write notes on balloons and send them
 
01:31:30.189 --> 01:31:30.199 align:start position:0%
up to their dad kind of thing um and of
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
course but of course we stop that
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
because we realize oh this is not good
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
for the environment now of course that
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't 20 plus balloons that was quite a
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
few but that it's been a long
 
01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
progression so my question is do you
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
think that the um education and
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
awareness piece is at a point where it
 
01:31:46.910 --> 01:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense for us to say yes people
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
really probably should know and
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
releasing that many is worth having a
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
consequence I think any knowledge
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
anybody has is helpful and if they put
 
01:31:56.990 --> 01:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
it to good use it's even better um and
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
the penalty is just there for people who
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
intentionally will relase great big
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
clusters of them and I do realize it's
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
hard to enforce something like this very
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
hard however there are balloons that are
 
01:32:10.510 --> 01:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
released with names of companies and
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
such on them I don't know if anybody
 
01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
wants to go far enough um if we try this
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't work um if they want to
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
go far enough so that when people buy a
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
cluster of balloons um that they at
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
least let the um um store or the shop
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
wherever they're buying them know who
 
01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
they are so that they can be traced back
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
I don't want to go that far um I just
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
again this is for people who
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
intentionally let balloons go and I
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
don't think they mean anything bad I
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
think people just weren't thinking and
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
it's the same thing as disposing of
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes or papers or anything like
 
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that we've had educate the people
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
get them to know what's going on and
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
what can happen and have people realize
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
that these are realistic things not just
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
these extreme pictures one bird want
 
01:33:01.709 --> 01:33:01.719 align:start position:0%
it's not like that um I I worry about
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
the fish that we eat you know what on
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
Earth did that fish ingest um before we
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
caught it and ate it um I I wonder a lot
 
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
of us wonder about what we're eating
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
today and what the consequences are what
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're doing to our Earth and we all love
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and our natural resources
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
let's do a little bit better to protect
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
our wildlife and ourselves thank you
 
01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:26.430 align:start position:0%
our wildlife and ourselves thank you
thank

01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
you representable
 
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
CS thank you for taking my question
 
01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
um sometimes when you it is fun to watch
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
balloons go up in the air um just
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
recently there was an article on the
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
news about the percentage of people with
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's that had
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
microplastics in their
 
01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
brain uh and are you aware of that and
 
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:57.800 align:start position:0%
it it uh you just think of all these
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
things in the environment they all come
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
home to roost at some
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
point thank you very much for your
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
comments and for sharing that knowledge
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
yes I was aware of that and for all
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
we've been through in recent years
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
regarding past and such we know that
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
every one of us has something in us um
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
just do the best we can to live as
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
healthily as we can and let's just add
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
one more little feature to safety thank
 
01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:25.229 align:start position:0%
one more little feature to safety thank
thank

01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
you see you no further questions thank
 
01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
you for bringing us the Bill thank you
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
very much oh Mr chairman um it's the
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
only time I've ever sponsored a bill
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan the only time I've ever
 
01:34:40.149 --> 01:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
sponsored a bill that doesn't have a
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
geographic spread people around the
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
state and it's just because of my
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
situation I wasn't able to do that this
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
year um but we do know from past history
 
01:34:51.109 --> 01:34:51.119 align:start position:0%

466

466
 
03:03:05.389 --> 03:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
and welcome the sponsor to introduce his
 
03:03:07.309 --> 03:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the record
 
03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative Roy Rockingham 32 I am
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
here to introduce House Bill
 
03:03:15.309 --> 03:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
466 relative to refusal of consent to
 
03:03:16.790 --> 03:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
testing to determine alcohol
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
concentration penalty for aggravated
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
driving and
 
03:03:22.229 --> 03:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
intoxicated here's the situation New
 
03:03:24.790 --> 03:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the worst or if not the
 
03:03:26.910 --> 03:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
worst almost the worst state in the
 
03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
entire country for refusals to take
 
03:03:31.469 --> 03:03:31.479 align:start position:0%
breathalizer tests the reason being the
 
03:03:33.630 --> 03:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
penalty for not taking it is the same as
 
03:03:37.910 --> 03:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
taking it so why take it
 
03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
um if we can get people to take these
 
03:03:42.910 --> 03:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
tests we can get data we can get people
 
03:03:45.030 --> 03:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
into programs we can get them help if
 
03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
they don't we can't and so we're
 
03:03:49.229 --> 03:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
spinning our wheels and our ouis are
 
03:03:50.469 --> 03:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
getting worse and people are getting
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
killed we need to stiffen these
 
03:03:54.670 --> 03:03:54.680 align:start position:0%
penalties to incentivize people to take
 
03:03:57.550 --> 03:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
the test otherwise really we're we're
 
03:03:58.910 --> 03:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
just like I said we're spinning our
 
03:04:03.150 --> 03:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
Wheels um the the member of the State
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
Police behind me he going to testify
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
he's going to give you some hard data um
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
everything I'll tell you is just
 
03:04:09.469 --> 03:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
anecdotal after meeting with them and
 
03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
their request for this bill I feel that
 
03:04:13.750 --> 03:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
is urgent that we take this action we do
 
03:04:16.030 --> 03:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
not want to be last in the country for
 
03:04:18.030 --> 03:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
this there's plenty of things would like
 
03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
to be but this isn't it so um I'd be
 
03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions on this
 
03:04:24.950 --> 03:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
but I would defer um to the trooper
 
03:04:28.389 --> 03:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.670 --> 03:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
data thank you very much representative
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%

03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
question is the is the text for this
 
03:04:38.870 --> 03:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill um the same as s sp48 that we
 
03:04:41.309 --> 03:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
considered last year I don't know
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
because I didn't sponsor that and I
 
03:04:44.790 --> 03:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
don't really recall um it it could be I
 
03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
don't know thank you yeah representative
 
03:04:50.110 --> 03:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
I do re remember that bill that the day
 
03:04:52.229 --> 03:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
that we heard it it's probably similar
 
03:04:54.190 --> 03:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
but I don't know that it is actually the
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
same right seeing no further questions
 
03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:15.150 --> 03:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:17.389 --> 03:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
McFarland absolutely when you when you
 
03:05:18.950 --> 03:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
have a SE if you could just introduce
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
yourself so we could um have that for
 
03:05:20.960 --> 03:05:23.750 align:start position:0%
yourself so we could um have that for
the

03:05:23.750 --> 03:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
record good afternoon everybody my name
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
is Lieutenant Chris storm I am from the

the division of state
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
police good afternoon my name is Ryan
 
03:05:35.870 --> 03:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
McFarland I'm the administrator for the
 
03:05:36.990 --> 03:05:37.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Safety
 
03:05:39.110 --> 03:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
Bureau of
 
03:05:40.990 --> 03:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
hearings so the New Hampshire State
 
03:05:44.910 --> 03:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
Police um we um highly endorse um HB 466
 
03:05:46.590 --> 03:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
which we seek to increase the penalties
 
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
for license loss result resulting from
 
03:05:51.710 --> 03:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
the refusal to take post arrest tests
 
03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
this measure is crucial to our efforts
 
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
in reducing DWI incidents and to keep
 
03:05:58.110 --> 03:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
the most atrisk drivers off our roads in
 
03:06:00.910 --> 03:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire currently uh as you heard
 
03:06:02.670 --> 03:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
um chairman Roy say we have one of the
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
highest refusal rates in the entire
 
03:06:08.429 --> 03:06:08.439 align:start position:0%
country this undermines our ability to
 
03:06:10.750 --> 03:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
combat impaired driving out on our
 
03:06:12.910 --> 03:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
roadways and right now we have
 
03:06:15.389 --> 03:06:15.399 align:start position:0%
approximately 70% of all of our fatal
 
03:06:19.389 --> 03:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
crashes are result of impaired driving
 
03:06:21.870 --> 03:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
um this highlights the urgent need to
 
03:06:23.630 --> 03:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
stricter consequences for those who
 
03:06:25.630 --> 03:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
refuse to cooperate with law enforcement
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
when it comes to driving well
 
03:06:30.590 --> 03:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
Intoxicated by implementing this will um
 
03:06:33.070 --> 03:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
the increase of license loss penalties
 
03:06:34.990 --> 03:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
will deter individuals from refusing
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
tests and promote safer driving
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
environments for all residents and
 
03:06:41.229 --> 03:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
visitors to our state and I'll let um
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
attorney McFarland kind of speak to the
 
03:06:44.429 --> 03:06:44.439 align:start position:0%
the hearing side of
 
03:06:48.070 --> 03:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
that good afternoon uh we're really
 
03:06:49.710 --> 03:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
attacking the refusal rate here in New
 
03:06:51.349 --> 03:06:51.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the national highway
 
03:06:53.870 --> 03:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
traffic safety administration has issued
 
03:06:56.630 --> 03:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
reports uh Nationwide and Nationwide the
 
03:06:57.910 --> 03:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
refusal rate and I put this in my
 
03:07:00.389 --> 03:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
written testimony uh in the it's usually
 
03:07:03.750 --> 03:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
around the 25% range in New Hampshire in
 
03:07:05.389 --> 03:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
the past three years it's in the written
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
testimony it's always been around in in
 
03:07:12.030 --> 03:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
2022 was 70% 2023 the refusal rate was
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
68% and in 2024 the refusal rate was
 
03:07:19.190 --> 03:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
69% uh so this bill would uh it's going
 
03:07:22.110 --> 03:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
to uh help lower uh or attack the
 
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
refusal High refusal rate in four
 
03:07:25.870 --> 03:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
different Avenues um it will increase
 
03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
the administrative license suspensions
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh for those who refuse so in the first
 
03:07:32.269 --> 03:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
instance of a refusal it will increase
 
03:07:34.110 --> 03:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
it from a six-month suspension to a
 
03:07:36.670 --> 03:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
one-year suspension uh as is currently
 
03:07:38.830 --> 03:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
indicated uh the current with it's a
 
03:07:40.670 --> 03:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
six-month suspension for a First Defense
 
03:07:43.110 --> 03:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's a refusal or a test over so
 
03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
this will increase it for a refusal in a
 
03:07:48.269 --> 03:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
second or subsequent refusal
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh or where an individual has a prior
 
03:07:52.389 --> 03:07:52.399 align:start position:0%
DWI on their record it'll increase it
 
03:07:54.910 --> 03:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
from a 2-year revocation to a three-year
 
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
revocation uh so that's the first part
 
03:07:58.790 --> 03:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the bill that will attack that now
 
03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:01.279 align:start position:0%
the bill also will add out of state
 
03:08:04.309 --> 03:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
either DWI convictions or out ofate
 
03:08:07.269 --> 03:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
refusals currently the B uh the statute
 
03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
does not address any out ofate DWI
 
03:08:11.110 --> 03:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
convictions so an individual can have an
 
03:08:14.070 --> 03:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
out ofate DWI conviction in other states
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine Vermont uh they have
 
03:08:18.429 --> 03:08:18.439 align:start position:0%
then they have a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:08:20.590 --> 03:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
license they refuse a test here in New
 
03:08:22.429 --> 03:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's treated as a first
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
offense first refusal and a six-month
 
03:08:27.030 --> 03:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
suspension uh so this will add language
 
03:08:29.910 --> 03:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
to include an out ofate DWI and out
 
03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
ofate refusal uh when we're calculating
 
03:08:34.030 --> 03:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
whether a person has a subsequent
 
03:08:36.950 --> 03:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
refusal uh on their record uh the the
 
03:08:39.510 --> 03:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
bill then goes on to also try to
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
increase individuals uh awareness and
 
03:08:44.550 --> 03:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
ability to get into counseling once they
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
they plead anyone who pleads guilty or
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
is found guilty of a DW must complete
 
03:08:49.590 --> 03:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
What's called the impaired driver Care
 
03:08:51.469 --> 03:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
Management program uh which is
 
03:08:53.389 --> 03:08:53.399 align:start position:0%
counseling associated with the DWI
 
03:08:56.229 --> 03:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
conviction this bill allows a six-month
 
03:08:59.269 --> 03:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
re uh reduction of that administrative
 
03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
suspension uh if they plead guilty to
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the DWI and undergo that treatment so uh
 
03:09:07.870 --> 03:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
so that 12-month uh refusal will then be
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
dropped down to a six-month refusal if
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
they plead guilty to the DW and go
 
03:09:14.790 --> 03:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
through the counseling uh necessary and
 
03:09:16.229 --> 03:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
the three-year will go down to two and a
 
03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
half years so this bill allows for that
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
reduction as well to somebody who pleads
 
03:09:23.550 --> 03:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
to gwi or is found guilty of the DWI uh
 
03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
then the last one also to try to make
 
03:09:29.190 --> 03:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
things uh fair in the process also
 
03:09:31.030 --> 03:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
amends the aggravated DWI currently
 
03:09:32.510 --> 03:09:32.520 align:start position:0%
right now an aggravated DWI an
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
individual who tests over uh twice the
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
de the legal limit which is a016 would
 
03:09:40.030 --> 03:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
be an aggravated DWI that's an
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
individual who's done what we've asked
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
them to do they've submitted to the
 
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
requested test and now they're they're
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
more than dou legal limit they're a 0.16
 
03:09:48.670 --> 03:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
or raer they can be charged with
 
03:09:50.590 --> 03:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
aggravate DWI and the way that the
 
03:09:52.469 --> 03:09:52.479 align:start position:0%
current statute is uh there's a
 
03:09:54.269 --> 03:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory jail sentence that goes along
 
03:09:56.670 --> 03:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
with that so this amendment to the would
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
would allow that uh that sentence to
 
03:10:00.910 --> 03:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
jail sentence to be suspended by the
 
03:10:03.110 --> 03:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
court discretion of the uh the
 
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutor the police officer and also
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
the court to amend that to uh allow to
 
03:10:10.269 --> 03:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
try to give some incentive individuals
 
03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
who have taken the test not to be unduly
 
03:10:15.150 --> 03:10:15.160 align:start position:0%
burdened by a required jail sentence
 
03:10:16.469 --> 03:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
because these are individuals who are
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
doing what we've asked them to do and
 
03:10:20.590 --> 03:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
submit to the testing as part of that so
 
03:10:22.309 --> 03:10:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh those are the four points of the bill
 
03:10:24.349 --> 03:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
that I I I think are very important to
 
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
address in kind um and willing to take
 
03:10:32.670 --> 03:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:35.309 --> 03:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
have representative
 
03:10:37.309 --> 03:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:10:40.670 --> 03:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um just to
 
03:10:42.670 --> 03:10:42.680 align:start position:0%
clarify on the last point you just
 
03:10:46.630 --> 03:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned so if someone currently
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
without prior um like conviction gets
 
03:10:52.950 --> 03:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
arrested for double the amount they have
 
03:10:55.150 --> 03:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
the mandatory sentence and so this would
 
03:10:57.229 --> 03:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
remove the ma mandatory sentence part or
 
03:11:00.229 --> 03:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
as if they had a prior interaction as
 
03:11:03.070 --> 03:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
well does that make sense yeah
 
03:11:04.429 --> 03:11:04.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely men said so if you have a
 
03:11:07.110 --> 03:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
prior DWI the sentence will whether you
 
03:11:08.830 --> 03:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
take the test or don't take the test if
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
you have convicted of a subsequent
 
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
offense there is a jail time that is
 
03:11:14.150 --> 03:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
associated with that what we're saying
 
03:11:17.469 --> 03:11:17.479 align:start position:0%
is if you are a first-time offender you
 
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
take the test and you blow over the 0.16
 
03:11:21.990 --> 03:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
right now it is a mandatory jail
 
03:11:24.309 --> 03:11:24.319 align:start position:0%
sentence we're saying that jail sentence
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
can be suspended it still can be imposed
 
03:11:29.110 --> 03:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the most egregious um situations but
 
03:11:31.950 --> 03:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
it can be suspended um so that there is
 
03:11:33.670 --> 03:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
more incentive to actually take the test
 
03:11:35.469 --> 03:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
and cooperate so that we actually can
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
get those convictions and get those
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
individuals off the roadway um just
 
03:11:40.910 --> 03:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
because cooperated doesn't mean you
 
03:11:43.030 --> 03:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
should go to jail yeah okay thank you
 
03:11:45.389 --> 03:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
can I ask a follow up um I was just
 
03:11:47.229 --> 03:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
curious if you could share with us any
 
03:11:49.630 --> 03:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
any other um like obviously not a whole
 
03:11:51.349 --> 03:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
in-depth thing but any broad thing you
 
03:11:53.309 --> 03:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
might be able to share about like what
 
03:11:57.030 --> 03:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
other um Avenues are being explored to
 
03:11:58.510 --> 03:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
deal with this problem you know I know
 
03:12:00.429 --> 03:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
that last year we increased the fine for
 
03:12:02.670 --> 03:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
like over serving people if you're in a
 
03:12:04.110 --> 03:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
bar or restaurant I'm just curious like
 
03:12:06.990 --> 03:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
what else is being explored because
 
03:12:08.830 --> 03:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
obviously this is a massive problem and
 
03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know yeah we've looked at um and I I
 
03:12:13.229 --> 03:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
can speak to what we've looked at is a
 
03:12:14.630 --> 03:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
traffic safety commission we've looked
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
at this through the office of Highway
 
03:12:18.309 --> 03:12:18.319 align:start position:0%
Safety the department of safety um I
 
03:12:19.590 --> 03:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
know the chiefs of police we've all
 
03:12:21.309 --> 03:12:21.319 align:start position:0%
looked at this in different Avenues um
 
03:12:22.750 --> 03:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
there are many different things that
 
03:12:25.910 --> 03:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
we've looked at um to get into specifics
 
03:12:28.790 --> 03:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
um what we're there are no real
 
03:12:31.229 --> 03:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
specifics and nationally we're kind of
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
the same problem the problem that we're
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
seeing in New Hampshire though is that
 
03:12:36.950 --> 03:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
refusal rate seems to be our biggest
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
hurdle to get over to try to stop some
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
of this and stop some of the recidivism
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
of this because it's basically hey if I
 
03:12:45.790 --> 03:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
refuse to take the test this is going to
 
03:12:47.550 --> 03:12:47.560 align:start position:0%
get pled down or they're going to have
 
03:12:48.710 --> 03:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
the evidence or they're not going to
 
03:12:50.389 --> 03:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
have any and these people are getting
 
03:12:51.990 --> 03:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
right back on the roadways driving and
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
then we're having the same problems over
 
03:12:56.229 --> 03:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
and over again um so that's what we're
 
03:12:57.790 --> 03:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
seeing and this is what we're trying to
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
fix um as far as other avenues or other
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
ways we haven't had there hasn't been
 
03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
really any other suggestions or anything
 
03:13:06.910 --> 03:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
like that other than fixing this refusal
 
03:13:08.870 --> 03:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
problem first and then we can build upon
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:16.150 --> 03:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
on see seeing no further questions thank
 
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:47.349 --> 03:13:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:50.030 --> 03:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
bite Buton on the bottom there sorry all
 
03:13:52.110 --> 03:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
right I apologize first time which is
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
why I didn't have enough copies I do
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
apologize um thank you all for your time
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
my name is Alexandria Morell I am the
 
03:14:02.309 --> 03:14:02.319 align:start position:0%
traffic safety resource prosecutor at
 
03:14:04.429 --> 03:14:04.439 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice I'm here as a
 
03:14:06.590 --> 03:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative of the Attorney General
 
03:14:09.150 --> 03:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
466 the amendment on page 1 line
 
03:14:16.550 --> 03:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
14-9 allows the DMV to review equivalent
 
03:14:19.190 --> 03:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
prior out of state refusals to determine
 
03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
if the refusal that occurs in New
 
03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is truly a firsttime or a
 
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
subsequent violation as of 2019 all
 
03:14:29.910 --> 03:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
states in the United States have implied
 
03:14:32.510 --> 03:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
consent laws which stipulate that a
 
03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
driver must consent to being tested um
 
03:14:37.030 --> 03:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
having their blood
 
03:14:39.550 --> 03:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
tested um if they are suspected of being
 
03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
an impaired
 
03:14:43.510 --> 03:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
driver New Hampshire is a member of the
 
03:14:46.790 --> 03:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
driver compact what that means is that
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
the states that are a part of this
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
compact exchange information concerning
 
03:14:53.030 --> 03:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
licensed suspensions and traffic
 
03:14:55.349 --> 03:14:55.359 align:start position:0%
violations so not parking tickets but
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
major motor vehicle offenses the theme
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
is one driver one license one record
 
03:15:03.510 --> 03:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
more importantly with this theme is that
 
03:15:06.110 --> 03:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
the language in other statutes already
 
03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
takes into account if you have
 
03:15:10.990 --> 03:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
convictions and other jurisdictions that
 
03:15:14.429 --> 03:15:14.439 align:start position:0%
are similar as noted um the DWI
 
03:15:16.389 --> 03:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
subsequent events and driving after
 
03:15:16.399 --> 03:15:17.469 align:start position:0%
subsequent events and driving after
revocation

03:15:17.469 --> 03:15:17.479 align:start position:0%
revocation
 
03:15:19.550 --> 03:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
or suspension if it was for a
 
03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
DUI so that makes sense to have this
 
03:15:24.429 --> 03:15:24.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that recognizes those out of
 
03:15:29.630 --> 03:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
state convictions for the refusal law
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
under the current law there is only 180
 
03:15:36.070 --> 03:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
day suspension for your first refusal
 
03:15:39.030 --> 03:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
for subsequent uh refusals the license
 
03:15:42.030 --> 03:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
suspension can be up to 2 years the
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
Amendments seek to increase the
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
administrative license suspension from
 
03:15:50.269 --> 03:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
180 days to one year so 6 months to a
 
03:15:52.429 --> 03:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
year and then up to three years for
 
03:15:55.229 --> 03:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
subsequent refusals these enhanced
 
03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
penalties are necessary to prevent
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
drivers from trying to skirt the
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
intended purposes of our criminal laws
 
03:16:05.429 --> 03:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
Savvy and unfortunately most often
 
03:16:09.070 --> 03:16:09.080 align:start position:0%
repeat offenders hope to receive a minor
 
03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
Administration uh license suspension for
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
their criminal behavior that is
 
03:16:15.990 --> 03:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous to our society and those
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior the statutes we have
 
03:16:20.269 --> 03:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
created are what are appropriate for the
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
crime that they have committed thus the
 
03:16:26.150 --> 03:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
issue is penalties for refusal are less
 
03:16:28.510 --> 03:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
severe than criminal penalties for
 
03:16:32.189 --> 03:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
failing the test and therefore we must
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
enact these
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
amendments If a driver feels that
 
03:16:38.429 --> 03:16:38.439 align:start position:0%
they're over the limit the current
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
suspension system incentivizes refusals
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
prior to becoming the traffic safety
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
resource prosecutor I was a public def
 
03:16:49.309 --> 03:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
vender for 10 years um 5 Years first in
 
03:16:51.750 --> 03:16:51.760 align:start position:0%
New York and then 5 Years in New
 
03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when I was assigned a DWI case
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
I knew immediately if there was a
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
refusal the case was likely going to
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
resolve in a plea deal or a trial that I
 
03:17:04.189 --> 03:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
could win without a test prosecutors
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
generally are unable to seek Justice and
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
obtain a conviction part of this problem
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
is CSI jurors want to see scientific
 
03:17:14.990 --> 03:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
evidence on every case even though
 
03:17:17.510 --> 03:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
legally that's not required
 
03:17:21.030 --> 03:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
in my experience personally as a public
 
03:17:23.469 --> 03:17:23.479 align:start position:0%
defender people who had already been
 
03:17:26.309 --> 03:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
arrested would often
 
03:17:28.830 --> 03:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
refuse that is because during their
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
subsequent investigation they knew if
 
03:17:33.229 --> 03:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the evidence they'd
 
03:17:35.150 --> 03:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
likely get a plea deal to what's called
 
03:17:40.269 --> 03:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
a non-true DWI first um this is a legal
 
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
sentence unfortunately where there's an
 
03:17:46.030 --> 03:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
enhancement of oneyear loss of license
 
03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
but 6 months can be suspended if they
 
03:17:50.830 --> 03:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
engage in treatment and pay all Their
 
03:17:53.830 --> 03:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
fines this obviously shows close to the
 
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
180 days so whether you refuse or if you
 
03:17:58.830 --> 03:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
have the ALS you're only receiving that
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
six months license suspension if there's
 
03:18:04.590 --> 03:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
no evidence compare that to an
 
03:18:06.910 --> 03:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
aggravated DWI as mentioned earlier is
 
03:18:10.710 --> 03:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you blow over a .16 BAC or even if
 
03:18:13.510 --> 03:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
you have a subsequent DWI fence then you
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
would have longer suspensions and also
 
03:18:17.910 --> 03:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
more conditions
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
so by enabling somebody to do just the
 
03:18:22.990 --> 03:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
ALS and either get a dismissal or a
 
03:18:25.030 --> 03:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
reduction they're avoiding the criminal
 
03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
penalties that are associated with
 
03:18:27.399 --> 03:18:28.429 align:start position:0%
penalties that are associated with
licensed

03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:18:30.990 --> 03:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
suspensions for those who oppose House
 
03:18:33.670 --> 03:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 466 they may argue that the
 
03:18:36.670 --> 03:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
amendments are punitive in nature but
 
03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
you need to read the entire bill as a
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
whole the Amendments actually create

hampsh
 
03:18:49.630 --> 03:18:49.640 align:start position:0%
you are more likely to die from a motor
 
03:18:53.269 --> 03:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
vehicle accident than from a homicide in
 
03:18:56.750 --> 03:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
2022 we had 204 drivers involved in
 
03:19:00.389 --> 03:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
fatal accidents of those 204 drivers
 
03:19:02.670 --> 03:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
involved only
 
03:19:07.469 --> 03:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
71% were willing to give a BAC test 18%
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
of those drivers who were tested had a
 
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
BAC higher than
 
03:19:14.189 --> 03:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
0.15 that's almost double the legal
 
03:19:15.710 --> 03:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
limit of
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
08 which that means that individual
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
could be charged with that aggravated
 
03:19:22.429 --> 03:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
DWI which has those enhanced penalties
 
03:19:25.349 --> 03:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
longer suspension mandatory jail time
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
and that's even if they are the first
 
03:19:28.830 --> 03:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
offender which I believe that was one of
 
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
the questions earlier so if you blow 0
 
03:19:31.880 --> 03:19:32.950 align:start position:0%
the questions earlier so if you blow 0
uh1

03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh1
 
03:19:35.150 --> 03:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
16.17 first time you're ever interacting
 
03:19:37.189 --> 03:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
with the police your charge is the
 
03:19:37.199 --> 03:19:39.150 align:start position:0%
with the police your charge is the
aggravated

03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
aggravated
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
DWI and as I mentioned there is a
 
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory jail time of 5 days currently
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
with the proposed amendment that would
 
03:19:49.870 --> 03:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
allow the judge to May suspend versus
 
03:19:52.110 --> 03:19:52.120 align:start position:0%
right now there is no discretion for the
 
03:19:54.309 --> 03:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
judge and so that's drawing your
 
03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
attention to page two line
 
03:20:01.590 --> 03:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
9-8 and so this amendment seeks to focus
 
03:20:05.189 --> 03:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
on treatment and not just punishment
 
03:20:07.870 --> 03:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
when you remove the mandatory jail time
 
03:20:10.830 --> 03:20:10.840 align:start position:0%
people are incentivized to take the test
 
03:20:12.349 --> 03:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
as mentioned earlier by attorney
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
McFarland since 2013 all drivers
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
convicted of a wi offense in New
 
03:20:19.790 --> 03:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are required to go to an
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
impaired driver Care Management program
 
03:20:24.870 --> 03:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
this allows them to be screened there's
 
03:20:26.750 --> 03:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
an evaluation to determine if there is a
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder and participate
 
03:20:31.830 --> 03:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
in treatment education or recovery
 
03:20:35.309 --> 03:20:35.319 align:start position:0%
Support Services if needed so a high BAC
 
03:20:38.229 --> 03:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
that .16 .17 I've seen some as high as
 
03:20:41.110 --> 03:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately .30 can indicate a high
 
03:20:43.830 --> 03:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
need for treatment for each individual
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
case the results can determine the
 
03:20:49.309 --> 03:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate rehabilitative options so in
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
conclusion the Amendments outlined in
 
03:20:54.670 --> 03:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 466 combat refusals to
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
decrease DWI related
 
03:20:59.790 --> 03:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
fatalities properly identify and
 
03:21:01.950 --> 03:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
sentence drivers who put everyone at
 
03:21:04.750 --> 03:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
risk and three provide evidence for
 
03:21:04.760 --> 03:21:07.070 align:start position:0%
risk and three provide evidence for
proper

03:21:07.070 --> 03:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
proper
 
03:21:10.269 --> 03:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
treatment does anybody have any
 
03:21:10.279 --> 03:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
treatment does anybody have any
questions

03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Muse
 
03:21:19.389 --> 03:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
03:21:22.429 --> 03:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
question what happens when somebody
 
03:21:26.070 --> 03:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
actually refuses a test so you you still
 
03:21:28.349 --> 03:21:28.359 align:start position:0%
have a case you have to prove how do you
 
03:21:31.229 --> 03:21:31.239 align:start position:0%
prove that case against the person so
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
the only way to prove that would be
 
03:21:36.110 --> 03:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
either obser officer observations um if
 
03:21:37.630 --> 03:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
there were any videos in the booking
 
03:21:39.550 --> 03:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
room so it's more looking at how
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
somebody was interacting with the police
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
um if there's Cruiser cam seeing their
 
03:21:46.910 --> 03:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
actual driving behavior um but with a
 
03:21:49.510 --> 03:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
test result I can personally say every
 
03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
single DWI trial or litigation I had I
 
03:21:55.070 --> 03:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
won because there were no breath results
 
03:21:55.080 --> 03:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
won because there were no breath results
or

03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:22:00.150 --> 03:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
blood followup
 
03:22:04.070 --> 03:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
follow with the Department of Safety and
 
03:22:06.710 --> 03:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
and many law enforcement agencies in New
 
03:22:08.830 --> 03:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now equipping their officers
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
with body cams and car cams has that
 
03:22:13.750 --> 03:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
changed is it is it has it gotten any
 
03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
easier to prove these
 
03:22:18.269 --> 03:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
cases to some degree with body cam but I
 
03:22:20.790 --> 03:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
think like the odor of alcohol you can't
 
03:22:23.189 --> 03:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
sense that by watching a video not all
 
03:22:25.349 --> 03:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
police departments have body cams right
 
03:22:27.429 --> 03:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
now unfortunately as we are aware both
 
03:22:29.070 --> 03:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
state and federally there might be
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
funding issues upcoming so this law
 
03:22:34.189 --> 03:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
covers all of New Hampshire so we have
 
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
to think about those jurisdictions and
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
those departments that can't afford dash
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
cam or body cam cameras do help
 
03:22:42.750 --> 03:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
especially in Booking rooms that's one
 
03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
reason that almost all booking rooms do
 
03:22:47.229 --> 03:22:47.239 align:start position:0%
have videos because there's a waiting
 
03:22:48.990 --> 03:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
period so you can kind of see how
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
somebody is interacting what their body
 
03:22:53.790 --> 03:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
movement is for the 20 minute period but
 
03:22:56.950 --> 03:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
overall the videos aren't
 
03:23:00.950 --> 03:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:05.070 --> 03:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
you else right see no further questions
 
03:23:08.790 --> 03:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
everyone we we have one more person once
 
03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
to testify do you want to
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
wait okay it's a response
 
03:23:20.349 --> 03:23:20.359 align:start position:0%
use also you have to keep in mind that
 
03:23:22.750 --> 03:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
um some people while they're being when
 
03:23:24.070 --> 03:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
they get to trial they're going to claim
 
03:23:26.070 --> 03:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
they have previously existing injuries I
 
03:23:27.990 --> 03:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
have a bad back so you can see a video
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
of a booking tape with somebody
 
03:23:31.790 --> 03:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
stumbling but without actually being
 
03:23:33.309 --> 03:23:33.319 align:start position:0%
there the evidence isn't that strong
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
because they had previous medical
 
03:23:36.550 --> 03:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
conditions and things of this nature
 
03:23:39.070 --> 03:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
that they claim
 
03:23:42.429 --> 03:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:50.309 --> 03:23:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
my my name is yhav and I oppose this
 
03:23:55.469 --> 03:23:55.479 align:start position:0%
bill um I think often we look we look at
 
03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
this issue in in the wrong eyes um the
 
03:24:01.150 --> 03:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution both of New Hampshire and
 
03:24:05.110 --> 03:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
the United States provides people to not
 
03:24:08.590 --> 03:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
um have to testify against themselves
 
03:24:13.150 --> 03:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
and by making people submit to tests
 
03:24:16.189 --> 03:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
under blackmail of the idea that they
 
03:24:18.189 --> 03:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
would suspend their license for
 
03:24:19.710 --> 03:24:19.720 align:start position:0%
potentially up to a
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
year um it gives a lot of force to a
 
03:24:25.990 --> 03:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
police officer who can stop someone and
 
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
then just say oh I smell alcohol and
 
03:24:32.950 --> 03:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
that would give the kick off the the
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
process with with no real evidence for
 
03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:37.309 align:start position:0%
process with with no real evidence for
them

03:24:37.309 --> 03:24:37.319 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
to to potentially and a lot of people
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
get get get uh convicted for DUIs when
 
03:24:49.070 --> 03:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
there was no good evidence to it and
 
03:24:51.150 --> 03:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
this type
 
03:24:54.309 --> 03:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
of of
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
punishment um really really goes to it
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
goes against the spirit of the of the
 
03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution and constitutional rights
 
03:25:05.950 --> 03:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
in general uh the the DMV suspended
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
license often for reasons that have
 
03:25:11.189 --> 03:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
nothing related to driver license uh to
 
03:25:13.950 --> 03:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
driving violations in the first place
 
03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
and it's just a although we the law view
 
03:25:19.189 --> 03:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is driving as a privilege it's hard to
 
03:25:21.550 --> 03:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
imagine living in today's age especially
 
03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
if you live in a small rural area where
 
03:25:26.349 --> 03:25:26.359 align:start position:0%
you you have to drive to work and
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
everything is a driver in distance um it
 
03:25:33.269 --> 03:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
it's a a huge burden and it shifts the
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
burden of of uh innocence onto onto
 
03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
people when there are no evidence at
 
03:25:44.590 --> 03:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
that point to the contrary so if
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
somebody gets stopped now they need to
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
prove that they're not driving Under the
 
03:25:51.269 --> 03:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
Influence by giving blood to the
 
03:25:54.070 --> 03:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
government um I think it is very
 
03:25:58.469 --> 03:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
unfairly shifts burden to people to
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
prove that they are not drunk rather
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
giving the rather letting the government
 
03:26:07.710 --> 03:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
the prosecution to prove that somebody
 
03:26:17.070 --> 03:26:17.080 align:start position:0%

welcome back everybody I am going to

open the public hearing for House Bill
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
482 and welcome the sponsor to
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
introduce thank you madam chairman um
 
03:49:05.670 --> 03:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Roy
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 32 I'm here today introducing
 
03:49:11.349 --> 03:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 42 um on behalf of the
 
03:49:13.149 --> 03:49:13.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Safety at their
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
request this bill would increase the
 
03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
penalty for driving over 100 mes hour in
 
03:49:20.149 --> 03:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
the last 6 years in New Hampshire based
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
on um statistics glean from Air
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement the number of people who
 
03:49:28.189 --> 03:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
have been caught or apprehended going
 
03:49:31.750 --> 03:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
over 100 miles hour has increased
 
03:49:35.550 --> 03:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
230% um so the number of fatalities are
 
03:49:38.110 --> 03:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
way way up um these accidents are
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
horrific when you start getting at this
 
03:49:42.189 --> 03:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
speed you start talking about a head-on
 
03:49:43.950 --> 03:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
collision at that and you're getting
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
into um mathematics that compounds when
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
you're talking about two vehicles
 
03:49:51.510 --> 03:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
colliding at speed weighing so many tons
 
03:49:53.149 --> 03:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
we also have these new electric vehicles
 
03:49:55.389 --> 03:49:55.399 align:start position:0%
that are very fast they're they're
 
03:49:57.389 --> 03:49:57.399 align:start position:0%
really neat but they're also very very
 
03:49:59.590 --> 03:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
heavy um because of the batteries the
 
03:50:01.710 --> 03:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
car is Mo the weight of the car is
 
03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
mostly batteries and as you know an
 
03:50:05.389 --> 03:50:05.399 align:start position:0%
object a motion tends to stay in motion
 
03:50:07.870 --> 03:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
until acted upon by an object or equal
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
or opposite speed so when it hits
 
03:50:12.990 --> 03:50:13.000 align:start position:0%
something going that fast um it is going
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
to be destructive beyond belief so the
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
people behind me are going to be able to
 
03:50:20.870 --> 03:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
again to put some um statistics to this
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
to tell you why this is necessary um
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
cars are going much faster and
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately people are dying and I
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
think we need to bring this to the
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
Public's attention that this is a very
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
serious issue and I'd be willing to take
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
questions but as I said the folks behind
 
03:50:36.790 --> 03:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
me are the experts and we'll have the
 
03:50:38.910 --> 03:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
numbers thank you for taking me back to
 
03:50:40.830 --> 03:50:40.840 align:start position:0%

yep a lot Mi Mr Lambert and I are old
 
03:51:36.429 --> 03:51:36.439 align:start position:0%
friends over a speed limit sign as a
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
03:51:38.239 --> 03:51:40.349 align:start position:0%
matter of
fact

03:51:40.349 --> 03:51:40.359 align:start position:0%

the division of State Police and we are
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
here to talk about the increase in
 
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
speeds over 100 miles an hour on our
 
03:52:05.590 --> 03:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
roadways um today we um the New
 
03:52:06.429 --> 03:52:06.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State Police and the
 
03:52:08.269 --> 03:52:08.279 align:start position:0%
department of safety wholeheartedly um
 
03:52:11.189 --> 03:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
support um HB 482 which we seek to
 
03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
increase penalties for individuals who
 
03:52:16.189 --> 03:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
drive in exceeding 100 m mil an hour as
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
these traffic speeds on our roadways
 
03:52:19.229 --> 03:52:19.239 align:start position:0%
continue to escalate the N Hampshire
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
State Police has um reported a
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
concerning rise in incidents of
 
03:52:25.630 --> 03:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
excessive speeding this trend um
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
necessitates the implementation of a
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
more stringent penalties to hold the
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
most dangerous drivers accountable for
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
their actions over the past few years we
 
03:52:34.870 --> 03:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
have witnessed a steady increase in
 
03:52:37.030 --> 03:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
these alarming speeds and is imperative
 
03:52:39.950 --> 03:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
that we make uh take decisive action to
 
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
ensure the safety of all of New
 
03:52:44.070 --> 03:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire roadway users by en uh
 
03:52:46.269 --> 03:52:46.279 align:start position:0%
endorsing ing uh House Bill 482 we can
 
03:52:49.149 --> 03:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
work together to create safer driving
 
03:52:51.309 --> 03:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
environment and deterring Reckless
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
Behavior on our highways um as
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative Roy just said um I I
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
actually have the pleasure and honor of
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
um um commanding our um aircraft unit as
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
well and I can tell you right now um
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it every single day out
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
here on our roadways and it is um scary
 
03:53:11.189 --> 03:53:11.199 align:start position:0%
um before um many years ago we would see
 
03:53:12.990 --> 03:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
hey a couple times we'd see people going
 
03:53:17.790 --> 03:53:17.800 align:start position:0%
100 101 um on various you know very
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
limited um it was kind of a big deal to
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
get somebody that was traveling over 100
 
03:53:24.750 --> 03:53:24.760 align:start position:0%
miles an hour we're getting two three
 
03:53:26.229 --> 03:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
every time our airplane goes out and
 
03:53:28.990 --> 03:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
flies um on all of our major interstates
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's um very very scary um our
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
numbers are soaring as far as um
 
03:53:35.070 --> 03:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
reckless driving goes for people that
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
are actually being apprehended for
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
driving over 100 miles an hour um just
 
03:53:41.070 --> 03:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
in the state police and I can't imagine
 
03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:42.399 align:start position:0%
some of the other towns or some of the
 
03:53:44.030 --> 03:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
other surface streets that are having
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
people that are traveling um in excess
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
of 100 miles an hour so what we found is
 
03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we need to do something to St to
 
03:53:53.070 --> 03:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
sty this from happening because often
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
times people will go into court um
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
they'll get the regular reckless driving
 
03:53:59.389 --> 03:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
charge or have it reduced to 99 miles an
 
03:54:01.110 --> 03:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
hour and they'll just get a a simply a
 
03:54:03.389 --> 03:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
fine and that's it we have to start
 
03:54:04.950 --> 03:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
holding this accountable because we are
 
03:54:07.269 --> 03:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
seeing our crashes um the speeds are
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
increasing on these crashes that we're
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
going and Mr Lambert's going to talk um
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
about the fact that our roadways are not
 
03:54:15.070 --> 03:54:15.080 align:start position:0%
built for this so turn right over to
 
03:54:17.030 --> 03:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
Bill good afternoon Madam chair and
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
03:54:21.030 --> 03:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
um my name is Bill Lambert I'm the New
 
03:54:23.269 --> 03:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire dot highway safety act of
 
03:54:25.710 --> 03:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh administrator um in
 
03:54:28.950 --> 03:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
our previous conversation um I was the
 
03:54:30.550 --> 03:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
state traffic engineer responsible for
 
03:54:33.469 --> 03:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
speed limits um the department of
 
03:54:35.670 --> 03:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
transportation's officially neutral on
 
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
this bill although we support anything
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
that we can do to bring speeds down
 
03:54:42.070 --> 03:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
because we agree that the uh the crashes
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the severity of the crashes are
 
03:54:45.750 --> 03:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
certainly out of control at this point
 
03:54:48.269 --> 03:54:48.279 align:start position:0%
in time we're seeing my program is
 
03:54:49.910 --> 03:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
responsible for reducing fatal and
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
serious injury crashes and we're seeing
 
03:54:53.309 --> 03:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
those numbers where they would like to
 
03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
go down towards zero they they're at
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
best leveling off and in some cases
 
03:55:00.389 --> 03:55:00.399 align:start position:0%
they're they're increasing I provided
 
03:55:03.550 --> 03:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony uh I was coached by um
 
03:55:05.950 --> 03:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
the current Deputy speaker in the years
 
03:55:07.590 --> 03:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
past I don't need to read that testimony
 
03:55:09.229 --> 03:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
but I do want to summarize some key
 
03:55:12.389 --> 03:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
points for for for you folks one would
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
be the concept of design speed when
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're designing and building highways we
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
generally use a design speed as a basis
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
for our design and that speed is usually
 
03:55:23.309 --> 03:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
the posted speed limit plus a little bit
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
for a factor of safety and that sets the
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
minimum criteria for what we design uh
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
highways for and if that's the minimum
 
03:55:32.110 --> 03:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
criteria what we're finding is Decades
 
03:55:34.110 --> 03:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
of using that design speed to design and
 
03:55:36.870 --> 03:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
build highways people are safe at the
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
design speed but they're comfortable
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
going much higher than that um so now
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking more in terms of Target
 
03:55:45.590 --> 03:55:45.600 align:start position:0%
speed so having a maximum speed that we
 
03:55:47.710 --> 03:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
designed for and it would be
 
03:55:49.389 --> 03:55:49.399 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable to go higher than that
 
03:55:50.750 --> 03:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're a long way from changing our
 
03:55:52.630 --> 03:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
highways to be self- enforcing in that
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
manner it's going to take years before
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
we get to that point but the the design
 
03:55:58.750 --> 03:55:58.760 align:start position:0%
speed for instance in horizontal
 
03:56:00.670 --> 03:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
alignment that would determine the
 
03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
minimum horizontal curve and super
 
03:56:02.800 --> 03:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
minimum horizontal curve and super
elevation

03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
elevation
 
03:56:06.510 --> 03:56:06.520 align:start position:0%
combination um that would keep a vehicle
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
on the road on the outside of a curve
 
03:56:10.469 --> 03:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
and when and if that's based on the
 
03:56:12.309 --> 03:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
design speed and people are doing twice
 
03:56:15.149 --> 03:56:15.159 align:start position:0%
that design speed the physics just don't
 
03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
work I mean they're likely to go off the
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
outside uh the other things like
 
03:56:20.750 --> 03:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
intersections and passing that are in
 
03:56:22.990 --> 03:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
here um I'll let you read but one of the
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
other things that's pretty significant
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
based on our experience this summer is
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
um things like roadside clearance we
 
03:56:33.269 --> 03:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
tend to uh have a risk management
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
analysis as far as when we'll put guide
 
03:56:37.510 --> 03:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
rail up and that's either for a fixed
 
03:56:39.990 --> 03:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
object or for divided highways for the
 
03:56:41.670 --> 03:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
opposite barrel and in October as you
 
03:56:43.830 --> 03:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
all know last year three straight
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
Wednesday we saw somebody cross the
 
03:56:48.030 --> 03:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
median of 95 and hit somebody in the
 
03:56:50.309 --> 03:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
other Barrel those highways are designed
 
03:56:52.309 --> 03:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
to be safe for that distance you don't
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
need to put barrier there but we're
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
finding when people are traveling a lot
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
faster than that risk management
 
03:56:59.389 --> 03:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
assessment they get to the other side
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
and when they get to the other side
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
really bad things happen so it's
 
03:57:05.229 --> 03:57:05.239 align:start position:0%
important to know the the consequences
 
03:57:07.510 --> 03:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
of how we design highways and why and
 
03:57:09.550 --> 03:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
what happens when people exceed our
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
assumptions when they're traveling on
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
the highway and I guess with that
 
03:57:18.030 --> 03:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.349 --> 03:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you madam chair
 
03:57:22.149 --> 03:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question I'm
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
just looking at the language and I'm
 
03:57:24.550 --> 03:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure that I'm
 
03:57:27.510 --> 03:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
getting it clear um and so what it says
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
is that um a violation and find not less
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
than $750 uh plus penalty assessment for
 
03:57:37.510 --> 03:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
first offense um and then that goes up
 
03:57:39.670 --> 03:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
to 1,000 for the second offense but then
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say um his or her uh
 
03:57:44.189 --> 03:57:44.199 align:start position:0%
license or operating priv privilege
 
03:57:46.269 --> 03:57:46.279 align:start position:0%
shall be revoked for a period of 90 days
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
for the first offense so I'm trying to
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
just group exactly what it is for the
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
first offense and for subsequent
 
03:57:56.349 --> 03:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
offenses so a violation um uh $750 fine
 
03:57:58.910 --> 03:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
and revoked uh for 90 days on the first
 
03:58:01.870 --> 03:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
offense yes ma'am okay and then the same
 
03:58:04.030 --> 03:58:04.040 align:start position:0%
except for $1,000 and it could be up to
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
a year for the second offense that is
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
correct and we'll leave that to the
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
Court's discretion depending on the how
 
03:58:11.550 --> 03:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
egregious it is or um you know the
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
obviously the length of time so we'll
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
leave that to the courts to discretion
 
03:58:16.830 --> 03:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
to to be able to make that determination
 
03:58:18.630 --> 03:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
and the whole point of that so you know
 
03:58:20.269 --> 03:58:20.279 align:start position:0%
is the fact that a regular Reckless
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
operation is just a 60-day loss of
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
license with a $500 fine so this is
 
03:58:28.110 --> 03:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
something that we already have traveling
 
03:58:29.790 --> 03:58:29.800 align:start position:0%
over a 100 miles an hour is already
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
Reckless operation but that penalty
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
needs to be stiffer for people that are
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
going that fast um it is um we're just
 
03:58:39.670 --> 03:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing it so so much that we have to do
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
something to stop this okay thank you
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
and can I just quick followup I just um
 
03:58:48.469 --> 03:58:48.479 align:start position:0%
the only thing I actually I I agree um
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
but um my question is you know from the
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
second one it says um 90 days up to a
 
03:58:55.590 --> 03:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
year for the second offense and I would
 
03:58:57.510 --> 03:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that we' want to make sure that it
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
was more than 90 days for the second
 
03:59:00.910 --> 03:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
offense if you've already again we did
 
03:59:03.030 --> 03:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
that for a couple different reasons one
 
03:59:05.349 --> 03:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
one of which is it depending on how how
 
03:59:06.750 --> 03:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
long the time that's been between
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
offenses if there there's no there's no
 
03:59:11.469 --> 03:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
limitation when they look back at that
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
right so you could have been 16 years
 
03:59:15.229 --> 03:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
old and now you're 5 years old is that
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
is that really fair right oh okay that
 
03:59:19.630 --> 03:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you I appreciate it
 
03:59:19.640 --> 03:59:21.710 align:start position:0%
makes sense thank you I appreciate it
representative

03:59:21.710 --> 03:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:59:24.269 --> 03:59:24.279 align:start position:0%
lels thank you for taking my question
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm all for this H I'm old enough to
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
remember folks swagin had 40 horsepower
 
03:59:36.550 --> 03:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
40 horsepower when I was growing up in
 
03:59:39.550 --> 03:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
the 60s if you had a car that had more
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
than 300 horsepower that was a super car
 
03:59:46.510 --> 03:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it was is high powerered
 
03:59:50.429 --> 03:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
today you you watch auctions and they
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
have 700 800 a th000 horsepower now who
 
03:59:58.469 --> 03:59:58.479 align:start position:0%
the heck needs that kind of car
 
04:00:01.550 --> 04:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative lelles yes my my qu I'm
 
04:00:04.070 --> 04:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
getting to my question please do my
 
04:00:04.080 --> 04:00:05.950 align:start position:0%
getting to my question please do my
question

04:00:05.950 --> 04:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
is couldn't we have some way when people
 
04:00:13.630 --> 04:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
register a car that once they go over a
 
04:00:16.269 --> 04:00:16.279 align:start position:0%
certain C amount of horsepower that they
 
04:00:19.590 --> 04:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
have to pay extra for that registration
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
and put it into enforcement maybe we
 
04:00:25.830 --> 04:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a plane over every single Highway
 
04:00:28.510 --> 04:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
all right that there's no sense in
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
having cars that go representative what
 
04:00:35.590 --> 04:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm I'm done
 
04:00:38.229 --> 04:00:38.239 align:start position:0%
what was there a question yes the
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
question is couldn't we use
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
registrations to increase the amount of
 
04:00:46.429 --> 04:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement that we have I believe that
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
would probably be a question for a
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
director morasco of the Department of
 
04:00:51.189 --> 04:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles I probably couldn't make
 
04:00:54.149 --> 04:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
any uh assumption on that
 
04:00:56.790 --> 04:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
I thank you I can't imagine having to
 
04:00:58.510 --> 04:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
punish somebody to to register the car
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
that hasn't done anything and meum by
 
04:01:04.389 --> 04:01:04.399 align:start position:0%
the way is the uh auction that is
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
Muse I I do have a question um and I'm
 
04:01:13.590 --> 04:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there are other
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
tools tools in the in the toolbox aside
 
04:01:19.910 --> 04:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
from from increasing penalties so other
 
04:01:22.030 --> 04:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
strategies that the do and the
 
04:01:25.550 --> 04:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
department of safety may be pursuing to
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this problem because I
 
04:01:29.229 --> 04:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
think one of the things that we've seen
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
is that increasing penalties isn't
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh doesn't necessarily lead
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
to the kind of behavior change a lot of
 
04:01:39.990 --> 04:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
times that we would like it
 
04:01:43.870 --> 04:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
to um I would say other than um some
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure changes or which are
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
obviously a tremendous amount of money
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
um the education piece we we've tried we
 
04:01:55.349 --> 04:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
we are using every Avenue that we can to
 
04:01:57.790 --> 04:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
um to get this um to get this out there
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
um we are constantly um trying to um
 
04:02:02.389 --> 04:02:02.399 align:start position:0%
post on our Social Media stuff through
 
04:02:03.710 --> 04:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
the office of Highway Safety the state
 
04:02:05.950 --> 04:02:05.960 align:start position:0%
police the department of safety um we're
 
04:02:07.550 --> 04:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
um also working in conjunction with the
 
04:02:08.830 --> 04:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to
 
04:02:11.189 --> 04:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
constantly get this message out there um
 
04:02:13.710 --> 04:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
we are trying to um get this stuff out
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
um as far as we can get to every time
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we have a significant event like
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that where someone's traveling in an
 
04:02:20.110 --> 04:02:20.120 align:start position:0%
excessive amount that we try to get it
 
04:02:21.750 --> 04:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
out to the media so that we have a lot
 
04:02:23.870 --> 04:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
of coverage on this to say we we are not
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
okay with this uh as a state and um we
 
04:02:29.710 --> 04:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
have lots of comments and lots of other
 
04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
things that are just asking us what
 
04:02:33.309 --> 04:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing to try to do this and this
 
04:02:35.070 --> 04:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
is the best Avenue right now that we can
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
think of to do this can I follow
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
up so Lieutenant storm and I and our
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues have been working for a lot
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
of a long time trying to how to address
 
04:02:47.830 --> 04:02:47.840 align:start position:0%
it how do we change the behavior as
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative lelle said we've got
 
04:02:50.990 --> 04:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
vehicles that are doing 100 miles an
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
hour plus we've got people that choose
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
to do more than 100 miles an hour so
 
04:02:56.910 --> 04:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
somehow we have to change those two
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
things um when we were little kids we
 
04:03:01.269 --> 04:03:01.279 align:start position:0%
learned that slow and steady wins the
 
04:03:03.269 --> 04:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
race right we watch bug's bunny he
 
04:03:05.550 --> 04:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
always loses to the tortoise uh we've
 
04:03:07.030 --> 04:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
been promoting the slow and steady it's
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
not a race uh I'm happy to pass these
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
around we've got some Billboards we've
 
04:03:13.389 --> 04:03:13.399 align:start position:0%
got some other Outreach uh we've been
 
04:03:15.149 --> 04:03:15.159 align:start position:0%
sending are driving towards zero folks
 
04:03:16.830 --> 04:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
to schools all across the state to try
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
to get to that lower that the younger
 
04:03:21.429 --> 04:03:21.439 align:start position:0%
drivers to get them convinced it's like
 
04:03:23.309 --> 04:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
seat belts when when my kids when I
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
started putting my kids in a car and
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
having them wear seat belts they
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
reminded my whole family that they had
 
04:03:30.349 --> 04:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
to put seat belts on so if we can get
 
04:03:32.349 --> 04:03:32.359 align:start position:0%
the younger drivers conditioned to think
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
that slow and steady is the safer way to
 
04:03:36.950 --> 04:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
go and we're doing as much as we can
 
04:03:39.349 --> 04:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
this is one more tool in the toolbox
 
04:03:46.750 --> 04:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
have we ever seriously in this state
 
04:03:51.229 --> 04:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
looked into things like speed cams I
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
know for my own personal experience um
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
having been uh flaged one time for going
 
04:03:59.790 --> 04:03:59.800 align:start position:0%
uh 55 through a 35 mph Zone in
 
04:04:01.830 --> 04:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
Washington DC and getting a surprise in
 
04:04:04.870 --> 04:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
the mail that cost me over $200 one
 
04:04:07.110 --> 04:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
thing I know is I never went over 35
 
04:04:09.269 --> 04:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
miles an hour again on that stretch of
 
04:04:13.030 --> 04:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
highway uh it seems pretty effective I
 
04:04:15.030 --> 04:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
think I think I I can take that so
 
04:04:17.790 --> 04:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of activity on it used to
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
be automated enforcement and now the
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
federal government's calling it speed
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
safety cameras it's just a term it's
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
words um sometimes words matter uh we we
 
04:04:29.149 --> 04:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
recognize in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:04:30.670 --> 04:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
with the only state that doesn't have a
 
04:04:32.630 --> 04:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
prime a seat belt law of any for adults
 
04:04:35.550 --> 04:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
that that's a long uphill climb um so
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
while the dot is interested in it we
 
04:04:39.870 --> 04:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
would we would try to pursue it more for
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
specific purposes because of the
 
04:04:44.110 --> 04:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
challenges with a the automated
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement and B the um the use of
 
04:04:49.110 --> 04:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
personal identification information uh
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
we'd be interested primarily in work
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
zones because that's where our people
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
are exposed to traffic whether it's the
 
04:04:56.349 --> 04:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
uniformed officers tow truck drivers or
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
dot Personnel but we're a long way from
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
there it's it's on the radar but it's
 
04:05:04.870 --> 04:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
not very close on the radar thank you
 
04:05:04.880 --> 04:05:06.950 align:start position:0%
not very close on the radar thank you
representative

04:05:06.950 --> 04:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
Newman you clarify the
 
04:05:13.070 --> 04:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
language could you just clarify the
 
04:05:15.550 --> 04:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
language where it says not less than 75
 
04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
plus penalty assessment is that
 
04:05:19.870 --> 04:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
assessment for the crime of reckless
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
driving or did it go together or what
 
04:05:24.149 --> 04:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
does that mean I'm sorry I I don't it's
 
04:05:27.790 --> 04:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.590 --> 04:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
15 and it just says penalty assessment
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
what is that is there a fine for re so
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
the penalty assessment is is is set by
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
the legislature so I think whatever the
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment is is what it's going
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
to be so I we we don't we're not asking
 
04:05:42.910 --> 04:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
for anything in the the bill that would
 
04:05:45.630 --> 04:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
have a a specific penalty assessment
 
04:05:47.710 --> 04:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
other than what is already um
 
04:05:50.269 --> 04:05:50.279 align:start position:0%
legislatively U appropriate but I mean
 
04:05:52.349 --> 04:05:52.359 align:start position:0%
those is the penalty assessment
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
currently for excuse me
 
04:05:58.429 --> 04:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
followup for the penalty
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
assessment there is a penalty ass a
 
04:06:02.870 --> 04:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
current penalty assessment for reckless
 
04:06:05.189 --> 04:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
driving yes on all fines there is that
 
04:06:08.189 --> 04:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
okay and then that assessment is
 
04:06:11.590 --> 04:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
included it's additional to the 750 yes
 
04:06:12.910 --> 04:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and the same thing for the
 
04:06:17.469 --> 04:06:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you

what I would like to say is that living

in Portsmouth and living close to I95 um
 
04:23:50.910 --> 04:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
we have seen numerous uh incidents over
 
04:23:54.229 --> 04:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
the years of people uh driving uh the
 
04:23:56.630 --> 04:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
wrong way down 95 and getting themselves
 
04:24:01.030 --> 04:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
and other people killed um uh I'm not
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
100% sure that anything that we do from
 
04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
a legal perspective uh could help but
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully there are some things we can
 
04:24:09.229 --> 04:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
do to discourage people from this kind
 
04:24:12.670 --> 04:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
of behavior and um I'm looking forward

administrator so I'll just read you what
 
04:25:00.429 --> 04:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
uh what I had prepared today um we
 
04:25:03.030 --> 04:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
strongly support HB 776 which aims to
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
add wrongway driving to the list of
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
aggravated DWI offenses in New Hampshire
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
in recent years we have witnessed a
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
significant increase in wrongway driving
 
04:25:13.510 --> 04:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
incidents with reports averaging nearly
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
one occurrence per day on our roadways
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
here in New
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire many of these drivers are
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
often found to be impaired by drugs or
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol posing severe risk to themselves
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
and others by elevating the penalties
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
for traveling the wrong way in violation
 
04:25:28.199 --> 04:25:28.910 align:start position:0%
for traveling the wrong way in violation
of

04:25:28.910 --> 04:25:28.920 align:start position:0%

04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
26526 which is our divided ways statute
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
while impaired by alcohol or drugs
 
04:25:36.710 --> 04:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
adding this to aggravated DWI we can
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
address an extremely dangerous behavior
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
that frequently results in fatal
 
04:25:41.119 --> 04:25:43.269 align:start position:0%
that frequently results in fatal
consequences

04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's had several tragic cases
 
04:25:48.510 --> 04:25:48.520 align:start position:0%

04:26:15.070 --> 04:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.269 --> 04:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
this underscores the urgent need for
 
04:26:19.229 --> 04:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
stricter enforcement and stricter
 
04:26:21.229 --> 04:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
penalties these examples highlight the
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
necessity of holding Reckless
 
04:26:24.389 --> 04:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
preventable actions to a much higher
 
04:26:26.910 --> 04:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
standard ultimately aiming to enhance
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
the safety of our roads for everybody
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon again um so the dot
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
is certainly partnering with our highway
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
safety officials and wrongway driving
 
04:26:41.990 --> 04:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
has been on our radar for a very long
 
04:26:42.000 --> 04:26:43.189 align:start position:0%
has been on our radar for a very long
time

04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:26:45.429 --> 04:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh and until recently the the crash
 
04:26:47.389 --> 04:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
numbers didn't necessarily warrant
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
specific action and we considered some
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
countermeasures for for years what we
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
would do to correct wrongway driving um
 
04:26:57.229 --> 04:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
recently as Lieutenant storm has has
 
04:26:59.229 --> 04:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
indicated the crash numbers have gone up
 
04:27:02.469 --> 04:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
crash severity is always har harsh um so
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
we've we've established a a work group
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
between the two agencies and including
 
04:27:08.070 --> 04:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
some of our local sa law enforcement
 
04:27:10.750 --> 04:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
Partners to come up with a comprehensive
 
04:27:14.349 --> 04:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
WR wrongway action plan uh to going to
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative M's point it's not just
 
04:27:18.510 --> 04:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the penalty phase of it we're
 
04:27:20.510 --> 04:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
looking at Aiden doing a network screen
 
04:27:22.030 --> 04:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
of our entire Highway Network to
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
identify the highrisk locations uh
 
04:27:26.189 --> 04:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
coming up with a hierarchy of counter
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
measures that we would use based on the
 
04:27:30.189 --> 04:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
on the risk factors and in implementing
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
that I I know our neighbors to the South
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
um fairly recently tried a pilot project
 
04:27:38.590 --> 04:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
where they added some pretty significant
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
technology to 10 pilot locations um
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
where they don't just detect the
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
wrongway driver and send them flashing
 
04:27:46.469 --> 04:27:46.479 align:start position:0%
lights when he makes the wrong turn he
 
04:27:49.630 --> 04:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
she um but they confirm a lot of the
 
04:27:51.070 --> 04:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
drivers that go the wrong way at an
 
04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
intersection will self-correct so they
 
04:27:55.389 --> 04:27:55.399 align:start position:0%
have second set of detection uh further
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
up the ramp to confirm that they're
 
04:27:59.429 --> 04:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
still going the wrong way um and then
 
04:28:01.389 --> 04:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
that starts alerting the law enforcement
 
04:28:02.710 --> 04:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
personnel and others that they may be a
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
wrong way driver on the road and then
 
04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's a third set of detection that
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
confirms that they're actually on the
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
highway going the wrong way and what
 
04:28:12.189 --> 04:28:12.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does is that sends alerts
 
04:28:13.750 --> 04:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the law enforcement Personnel it may
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
send messages to the message boards to
 
04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
let the public know uh and and other
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
measures like that so that's part of
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
what we're working toward um but we also
 
04:28:24.109 --> 04:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that drivers are aware
 
04:28:26.309 --> 04:28:26.319 align:start position:0%
that there's a significant penalty uh
 
04:28:28.269 --> 04:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
for going the wrong way and making those
 
04:28:30.189 --> 04:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions that that end up in
 
04:28:35.269 --> 04:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.389 --> 04:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
fatalities representative n thank you
 
04:28:39.790 --> 04:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:28:41.630 --> 04:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if you said it so
 
04:28:44.269 --> 04:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
I just want to um revisit if you if you
 
04:28:46.309 --> 04:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
did um and I apologize if I didn't hear
 
04:28:49.030 --> 04:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
it what percentage of uh wrongway
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
drivers are found to be
 
04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
intoxicated that's a great question
 
04:28:54.830 --> 04:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative and um I would say I
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the exact number for you
 
04:28:57.750 --> 04:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
right now I can get that for you but it
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
is a majority of um those wrong way
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
drivers are actually impaired right
 
04:29:02.359 --> 04:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
drivers are actually impaired right
thank

04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:29:05.630 --> 04:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
you if if I could just have a quick
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
followup to to her question when you
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
say imp impaired not necessarily alcohol
 
04:29:16.670 --> 04:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
but just substance impaired absolutely
 
04:29:18.510 --> 04:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
it's both drugs and alcohol absolutely
 
04:29:20.990 --> 04:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
Muse I did have a quick quick question
 
04:29:25.429 --> 04:29:25.439 align:start position:0%
about the statute uh the divided highway
 
04:29:28.309 --> 04:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
statute it's not a wrongway driving
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
statute it's a divided highway so if I'm
 
04:29:33.229 --> 04:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
correct in interpreting it somebody who
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
actually is on a let's say a on a on a
 
04:29:39.630 --> 04:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
highway with um letd say a stripe in the
 
04:29:41.189 --> 04:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
middle kind of dividing both sides of
 
04:29:43.229 --> 04:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
the highway who veers over under the
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
other side of the highway they could
 
04:29:48.109 --> 04:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
also be prosecuted under this no
 
04:29:49.870 --> 04:29:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative so I'll give you a prime
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
example in your District so if you
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
looked at like the route one bypass for
 
04:29:56.429 --> 04:29:56.439 align:start position:0%
instance so it is actually divided under
 
04:29:59.469 --> 04:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
26526 physical barrier I get you okay
 
04:29:59.479 --> 04:30:01.990 align:start position:0%
26526 physical barrier I get you okay
thank

04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.830 --> 04:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
you any other question any other
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
 
04:30:08.080 --> 04:30:09.309 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing none thank you
very

04:30:09.309 --> 04:30:09.319 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
much is
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else with us that
 
04:30:17.670 --> 04:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill 776 that
 
04:30:20.229 --> 04:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
has not turned in a pink card okay so
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none I am going to I'm going to
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
recess this hearing and um as a courtesy
 
04:30:30.590 --> 04:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
if our chairman just wants to reopen it
 
04:30:33.429 --> 04:30:33.439 align:start position:0%
when we meet next Friday then he would
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
have that option if there's anything
 
04:30:36.269 --> 04:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
that he needs to add but I'm pretty sure
 
04:30:38.070 --> 04:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we we heard everything we need I
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
just think that's the the right thing to
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
do okay so with that that is in
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
recess and we are cranking right along
 
04:30:50.349 --> 04:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
here friends um we actually are in
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
recess until 3:00 p.m. our next bill is
 
04:31:10.910 --> 04:31:10.920 align:start position:0%

you've had a long day so far um
 
05:03:43.708 --> 05:03:43.718 align:start position:0%
introducing you to HB 473 which would be
 
05:03:46.390 --> 05:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
criminal criminalizing multiple forms of
 
05:03:48.430 --> 05:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
exposing children to controlled
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
substances and allowing law enforcement
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
to take a child into protected custody
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
for screening and testing and an
 
05:03:57.150 --> 05:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
instance of suspected or actual criminal
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
exposure to Controlled Substances this
 
05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
is amending RSA
 
05:04:02.000 --> 05:04:03.670 align:start position:0%

05:04:10.030 --> 05:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine exposure to add add
 
05:04:12.310 --> 05:04:12.320 align:start position:0%

05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%

colon1 um oh my gosh I forget my Roman
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
numerals anyway I'm going to just say
 
05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
XXVI so there you go into the human body
 
05:04:31.470 --> 05:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
and to give you a little bit of a
 
05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
background as to how the idea to amend
 
05:04:36.430 --> 05:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
this bill came about I've been working
 
05:04:38.430 --> 05:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
with the legislative youth advisory
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
Council for the past couple of years and
 
05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
I received a phone call over the summer
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
from one of our members test sumers and
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
she wanted to talk to me about amending
 
05:04:49.868 --> 05:04:49.878 align:start position:0%
this RSA and she along with Chief
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
suckling from Alexandria convinced me we
 
05:04:55.150 --> 05:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
needed to do so and I wanted to
 
05:04:57.430 --> 05:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
highlight for whomever is listening at
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
home especially if you're a young person
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
that no matter what age you are you can
 
05:05:05.708 --> 05:05:05.718 align:start position:0%
affect positive change and your efforts
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
do make a difference I wanted to give
 
05:05:12.310 --> 05:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
you a bit of mystory about 639- a colon
 
05:05:13.670 --> 05:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
one for those who weren't in the
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
legislature at the time this law was
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
created and I wasn't either and it was
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
interesting to research it um our
 
05:05:20.830 --> 05:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
current law pertains only to
 
05:05:22.830 --> 05:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine exposure and this came
 
05:05:25.510 --> 05:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
about as a result of the methamphetamine
 
05:05:28.990 --> 05:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
crisis in the early 2000s the federal
 
05:05:31.948 --> 05:05:31.958 align:start position:0%
drug endangered children movement began
 
05:05:33.868 --> 05:05:33.878 align:start position:0%
then to respond to the growing
 
05:05:35.948 --> 05:05:35.958 align:start position:0%
phenomenon of finding children living
 
05:05:39.230 --> 05:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
among the squalor of meth labs located
 
05:05:40.830 --> 05:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
in home homes and other areas where
 
05:05:42.910 --> 05:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
children were living and playing and the
 
05:05:44.670 --> 05:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
children found in these situations were
 
05:05:47.030 --> 05:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
often severely harmed or neglected and
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
in many instances tested positive for
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
drugs and at that time Most states pass
 
05:05:55.030 --> 05:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
laws nearly identical to
 
05:05:58.110 --> 05:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
ours since that time many states have
 
05:06:00.310 --> 05:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
expanded their drug exposed and child
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
endangerment laws and we need to do so
 
05:06:05.548 --> 05:06:05.558 align:start position:0%
also during the past eight years there
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
have been six child deaths that have
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
been confirmed from accident Al drug
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
exposure and three of those had occurred
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
in 2022 and
 
05:06:19.110 --> 05:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
2023 three deaths occurred from fentanyl
 
05:06:23.910 --> 05:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
overdose one death from Fentanyl and
 
05:06:27.788 --> 05:06:27.798 align:start position:0%
cocaine combined overdose and one death
 
05:06:30.390 --> 05:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
from a combination of methamphetamine
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
and Fentanyl overdose regarding children
 
05:06:35.350 --> 05:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
who have had serious medical incidents
 
05:06:37.350 --> 05:06:37.360 align:start position:0%
from illegal drug exposure we are
 
05:06:40.628 --> 05:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
reminded quite frequently from the
 
05:06:45.070 --> 05:06:45.080 align:start position:0%
media of this crisis to that I would
 
05:06:47.670 --> 05:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
like to note for you have occurred in
 
05:06:51.670 --> 05:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
the past few months an 11-year-old and a
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
2-year-old both of them had to have
 
05:06:57.510 --> 05:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
First Responders administer Naran to
 
05:06:59.030 --> 05:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
them to save their
 
05:07:02.390 --> 05:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
lives in speaking with Chief suckling
 
05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
and my police chief chief fi and other
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
local and state law enforcement folks
 
05:07:10.030 --> 05:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
they're looking for help to help
 
05:07:12.190 --> 05:07:12.200 align:start position:0%
children they are seeing in situations
 
05:07:15.628 --> 05:07:15.638 align:start position:0%
that can cause immediate harm or death
 
05:07:17.628 --> 05:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to facilitate
 
05:07:20.470 --> 05:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
immediate testing to a child they
 
05:07:20.480 --> 05:07:22.670 align:start position:0%
immediate testing to a child they
suspect

05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
suspect
 
05:07:26.110 --> 05:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
sorry has ingested inhaled or absorbed
 
05:07:28.868 --> 05:07:28.878 align:start position:0%
through the skin a drug or drugs that
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
can cause irreversible harm or
 
05:07:34.470 --> 05:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
death give us the tools we need to help
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
these kids is what I'm constantly
 
05:07:37.628 --> 05:07:37.638 align:start position:0%
hearing from law
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement the real goal here is to
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
enable the coordinated efforts of law
 
05:07:45.868 --> 05:07:45.878 align:start position:0%
enforcement medical services and child
 
05:07:49.150 --> 05:07:49.160 align:start position:0%
welfare services to ensure that drug
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
endangered children and their families
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
receive appropriate attention and care
 
05:07:58.070 --> 05:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
after me you will hear testimony on what
 
05:08:00.628 --> 05:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
these officers are experiencing boots on
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
the ground around the state with
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
children exposed to all sorts of illegal
 
05:08:07.788 --> 05:08:07.798 align:start position:0%
drugs and the real life positive effects
 
05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
of what passing this bill will mean
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time this afternoon and
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
I know you've had a long day again and
 
05:08:16.470 --> 05:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep it short here if you
 
05:08:20.270 --> 05:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.430 --> 05:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
them so I'm also up here because we also
 
05:08:24.990 --> 05:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
put together an amendment we're hoping
 
05:08:27.110 --> 05:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
you will consider we spoke to the
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
speaker and he has approved of this it
 
05:08:32.430 --> 05:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
is to um extend the statute of
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
limitations for child endangerment to 10
 
05:08:35.200 --> 05:08:42.150 align:start position:0%
limitations for child endangerment to 10
years

05:08:42.150 --> 05:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:46.868 --> 05:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
so if if if I may I'm just looking at
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at obviously the bill that
 
05:08:51.628 --> 05:08:51.638 align:start position:0%
you gave us not the not the amendment no
 
05:08:51.638 --> 05:08:53.310 align:start position:0%
you gave us not the not the amendment no
yeah

05:08:53.310 --> 05:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
um so so basically where you have you
 
05:08:59.310 --> 05:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
know crossed off the methan fetamines
 
05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
related and added you just basically
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
changed out the that word for controll
 
05:09:07.750 --> 05:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
drug controlled drugs or uh controlled
 
05:09:10.510 --> 05:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
substance yes thank oh sorry yes thank
 
05:09:13.150 --> 05:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
you for the question yes I did and I I
 
05:09:15.990 --> 05:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
added as defined by that RSA in case
 
05:09:17.830 --> 05:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
there would ever be any changes
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
additions or deletions from that um list
 
05:09:24.030 --> 05:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
in that RSA that it would automatically
 
05:09:27.548 --> 05:09:27.558 align:start position:0%
you know apply to this okay so basically
 
05:09:28.830 --> 05:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to go back and
 
05:09:31.030 --> 05:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
continuously change the law if it's if
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the definition is changed to something
 
05:09:36.350 --> 05:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
else or added right yes okay okay
 
05:09:39.708 --> 05:09:39.718 align:start position:0%
representative Muse
 
05:09:41.230 --> 05:09:41.240 align:start position:0%
as I read this this would include
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis as well correct yes it would
 
05:09:44.360 --> 05:09:46.910 align:start position:0%
cannabis as well correct yes it would
thank

05:09:46.910 --> 05:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
you anybody else all right seeing no
 
05:09:54.110 --> 05:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:56.948 --> 05:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
much if if you could just give them to
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Newman she'll pass
 
05:10:07.190 --> 05:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
Kirk thank you it's actually kerk my
 
05:10:19.270 --> 05:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
more complicated name sorry about that
 
05:10:21.868 --> 05:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
um so the K is not silent sorry the K is
 
05:10:25.628 --> 05:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
not silent yeah and so actually this is
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
a great lead in representative Muse LED
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
right into this um I am the chair of sry
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
for the record Jerry kerk I am the chair
 
05:10:35.150 --> 05:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
oversight board and a retired surgeon uh
 
05:10:39.868 --> 05:10:39.878 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic Canabis medical
 
05:10:42.910 --> 05:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
oversight border tcob is a is
 
05:10:44.990 --> 05:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
statutorily charged with the medical
 
05:10:46.230 --> 05:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
oversight of the New Hampshire
 
05:10:48.150 --> 05:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program it's
 
05:10:49.868 --> 05:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
composed of 10 medical providers from
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
different Specialties and a therapeutic
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient the medical director of
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
a DHHS and a clinical representative
 
05:10:59.030 --> 05:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
from an ATC atc's are the
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
dispensaries I must note that tcml did
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
not examine this bill as we were unaware
 
05:11:07.708 --> 05:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
of it however my testimony is consistent
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the therapeutic cannabis statute
 
05:11:12.070 --> 05:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
and the position of the department and
 
05:11:14.868 --> 05:11:14.878 align:start position:0%
of TCM o regarding therapeutic cannabis
 
05:11:17.270 --> 05:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
patient protections basically I'm a nerd
 
05:11:19.390 --> 05:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
I was perusing the calendar I saw this
 
05:11:22.150 --> 05:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill and I said huh does that have any
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
any impact on cannabis so I looked at it
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
and I realized it did the point is this
 
05:11:29.350 --> 05:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill is well-intentioned and I'm simply
 
05:11:31.430 --> 05:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
here to point out an oversight which can
 
05:11:33.070 --> 05:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
be remedied with an
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh as written it has
 
05:11:37.110 --> 05:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences which will
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
impact patients and caregivers
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
registered with the therapeutic cannabis
 
05:11:43.230 --> 05:11:43.240 align:start position:0%
program the bill refers to the state's
 
05:11:46.350 --> 05:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
control Drug Act in RSA
 
05:11:48.910 --> 05:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
318b which includes cannabis or
 
05:11:51.628 --> 05:11:51.638 align:start position:0%
marijuana the chapter does not have a
 
05:11:53.750 --> 05:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
general carveout for therapeutic
 
05:11:56.310 --> 05:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis authorized under RSA
 
05:11:59.070 --> 05:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
126x so in cases like this in which we
 
05:12:02.270 --> 05:12:02.280 align:start position:0%
are referring to 318 broadly a specific
 
05:12:04.230 --> 05:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
exemption is needed for those registered
 
05:12:07.030 --> 05:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
patients and caregivers to not be
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
unintentionally impacted
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's it is important as representative M
 
05:12:13.230 --> 05:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
pointed out that cannabis is included
 
05:12:14.868 --> 05:12:14.878 align:start position:0%
because we know that kids are getting a
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
hold of parents cannabis and that is not
 
05:12:19.548 --> 05:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
good and that's why we really care about
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
it in the therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
but the Department of Health and Human
 
05:12:25.150 --> 05:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
Services position is that therapeutic
 
05:12:26.788 --> 05:12:26.798 align:start position:0%
cannabis should be treated the same as
 
05:12:30.788 --> 05:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
prescription medications HP 473 includes
 
05:12:32.990 --> 05:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriate exception for someone to
 
05:12:34.990 --> 05:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
have a controlled substance if they have
 
05:12:37.948 --> 05:12:37.958 align:start position:0%
a prescription for it however the
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program does not
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
use a prescription for cannabis and the
 
05:12:45.628 --> 05:12:45.638 align:start position:0%
reason for that is that cannabis is a
 
05:12:47.270 --> 05:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
schedule one drug and therefore it
 
05:12:50.150 --> 05:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
cannot be prescribed that's the
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
definition a person becomes a qualifying
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
patient when their provider certifies
 
05:12:57.470 --> 05:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they have a qualifying condition
 
05:12:59.948 --> 05:12:59.958 align:start position:0%
listed in statute which allows them to
 
05:13:03.350 --> 05:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
possess and use therapeutic
 
05:13:06.030 --> 05:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis now this exemption so we need
 
05:13:07.190 --> 05:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
to put an exemption in for the
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients because
 
05:13:10.110 --> 05:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
they should be treated the same as if
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
they had a prescription but this
 
05:13:14.230 --> 05:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
exemption would also need to include
 
05:13:16.590 --> 05:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
caregivers not just patients and the
 
05:13:19.868 --> 05:13:19.878 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program a caregiver
 
05:13:22.350 --> 05:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
is somebody who handles cannabis for a
 
05:13:24.430 --> 05:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
patient because of the patient's
 
05:13:27.310 --> 05:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
inability to do so so for example let's
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
say you have an elderly person who
 
05:13:31.310 --> 05:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
cannot drive is using therapeutic
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
cannabis for severe pain and the
 
05:13:35.868 --> 05:13:35.878 align:start position:0%
caregiver is the one who drives to the
 
05:13:37.990 --> 05:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
ATC CU there's you know there's only
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
seven around the state
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
and they will drive there pick it up for
 
05:13:44.150 --> 05:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
that uh patient and bring it back but
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
they may actually have it in their house
 
05:13:46.910 --> 05:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
for a short time before they make the
 
05:13:49.310 --> 05:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
delivery to that
 
05:13:52.548 --> 05:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
patient likewise miners are not allowed
 
05:13:54.270 --> 05:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
to handle their own cannabis in the
 
05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
program the parent or the legal guardian
 
05:14:00.310 --> 05:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
is designated as a caregiver to handle
 
05:14:02.548 --> 05:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
their cannabis so we wouldn't want the
 
05:14:05.110 --> 05:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
child taken away because the parent gave
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
them the Cannabis that they're supposed
 
05:14:08.788 --> 05:14:08.798 align:start position:0%
to be taking for their pediatric seizure
 
05:14:11.510 --> 05:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
dis order when they are supposed to be
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
able to do that under RSA
 
05:14:16.470 --> 05:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
126x now the department supports the
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
responsible use and storage of
 
05:14:20.310 --> 05:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis products our rules
 
05:14:23.708 --> 05:14:23.718 align:start position:0%
require that uh uh cannabis is dispensed
 
05:14:25.750 --> 05:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
in child resistant packaging opaque and
 
05:14:27.868 --> 05:14:27.878 align:start position:0%
not attractive to kids their program
 
05:14:31.030 --> 05:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
encourages and provides educa excuse me
 
05:14:33.310 --> 05:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
education on safe storage and transport
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
and use of cannabis if there are
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
children in the home they sell atcs sell
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
lock boxes to keep it safe and the DH
 
05:14:42.910 --> 05:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
DHHS has the authorization to revoke the
 
05:14:46.590 --> 05:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
registration of a patient who uses quote
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis in a manner that puts others at
 
05:14:50.470 --> 05:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
risk of their health safety or welfare
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
or who has failed to take reasonable
 
05:14:55.190 --> 05:14:55.200 align:start position:0%
precautions to avoid putting others at
 
05:14:58.430 --> 05:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
such risk end quote therefore I would
 
05:14:59.910 --> 05:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
ask that an amendment be crafted to
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
clarify that this chapters does not
 
05:15:04.670 --> 05:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
apply to patients or caregivers in the
 
05:15:07.390 --> 05:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program that would
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
not preclude it still applying to
 
05:15:10.430 --> 05:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who's using recreational
 
05:15:14.270 --> 05:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
Cannabis only if they are a registered
 
05:15:16.590 --> 05:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
patient or caregiver this could be most
 
05:15:19.110 --> 05:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
easily achieved by adding a new section
 
05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
five and I have this this language is in
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
the handout that I gave you of my
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
testimony that could State this chapter
 
05:15:29.070 --> 05:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
shall not apply to the therapeutic use
 
05:15:31.910 --> 05:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
of cannabis as authorized by oh it
 
05:15:35.230 --> 05:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
should say RSA 126x my apologies the
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
wording would include that that wording
 
05:15:38.670 --> 05:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
would include then both the qualifying
 
05:15:41.788 --> 05:15:41.798 align:start position:0%
Pat and caregivers and Mike Hol who's
 
05:15:43.150 --> 05:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
administrator and I will be happy to
 
05:15:47.070 --> 05:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
assist in crafting the amendment if you
 
05:15:49.150 --> 05:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
have any questions thank you and do you
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
point sorry I was trying to finish up
 
05:16:00.628 --> 05:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
my okay
 
05:16:02.430 --> 05:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
so so
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
basically I just want to make sure I
 
05:16:04.400 --> 05:16:05.510 align:start position:0%
basically I just want to make sure I
understand

05:16:05.510 --> 05:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
is regardless if it was
 
05:16:12.750 --> 05:16:12.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic or just regular cannabis a
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
person having it that's not supposed to
 
05:16:17.150 --> 05:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
in this situation would be a
 
05:16:19.788 --> 05:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
minor is the same effect so what you're
 
05:16:22.868 --> 05:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
saying is if they're supposed to have it
 
05:16:25.150 --> 05:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
that's why you want the carve out yes I
 
05:16:27.150 --> 05:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
mean basically it's um the language that
 
05:16:29.150 --> 05:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
is currently in the bill very nicely
 
05:16:31.030 --> 05:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
carves out saying hey I've got a
 
05:16:34.110 --> 05:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
prescription for let's say per cassette
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
and so the fact I have it in my house
 
05:16:36.990 --> 05:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a kid in the house doesn't
 
05:16:38.868 --> 05:16:38.878 align:start position:0%
mean I'm abusing drugs because I got to
 
05:16:40.910 --> 05:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
prescription but because cannabis is a
 
05:16:43.628 --> 05:16:43.638 align:start position:0%
schedule one drug you cannot have a
 
05:16:45.310 --> 05:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
prescription instead you're a qualified
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
patient it's just a bit of a you know
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
kind of sticky thing that it's it's it's
 
05:16:51.030 --> 05:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
just the way the program has to work
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
because it's a schedule one drug if it
 
05:16:54.350 --> 05:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
does get rescheduled the three which is
 
05:16:56.910 --> 05:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
being talked about that would all change
 
05:16:58.708 --> 05:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
but um so this would just allow the same
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
protections for a therapedic cannabis
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
program as a person who is using a
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
controlled substance under prescription
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
because again this is all under the
 
05:17:09.350 --> 05:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
guidance of a provider
 
05:17:12.390 --> 05:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
you don't get qualified just by you know
 
05:17:15.030 --> 05:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
saying I want it your provider qualifies
 
05:17:16.948 --> 05:17:16.958 align:start position:0%
you saying you have a qualifying
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
condition and therefore you uh gain the
 
05:17:20.750 --> 05:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
protections of
 
05:17:22.990 --> 05:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
126x and so it is still under the
 
05:17:25.990 --> 05:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
direction of a provider understood thank
 
05:17:29.948 --> 05:17:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:32.190 --> 05:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
um representative pette do you have your
 
05:17:35.470 --> 05:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
hand up no representative
 
05:17:37.788 --> 05:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
Muse could you explain to me one more
 
05:17:39.750 --> 05:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
time for the those who don't get it in
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
the back World which include me
 
05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um how DHHS and and the and the
 
05:17:49.670 --> 05:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program just the
 
05:17:52.948 --> 05:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
steps that are in place um for somebody
 
05:17:56.270 --> 05:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
who does allow their cannabus to be used
 
05:17:59.190 --> 05:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
let's say by kids even their own kids um
 
05:18:00.548 --> 05:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
yes I mean first of all important to
 
05:18:02.948 --> 05:18:02.958 align:start position:0%
understand there are only six minors who
 
05:18:05.868 --> 05:18:05.878 align:start position:0%
are qualified we really try to avoid the
 
05:18:09.190 --> 05:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis in anybody under age 25
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
because of the developing brain and
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
there are distinct problems however it
 
05:18:16.470 --> 05:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
can be of help in some pediatric seizure
 
05:18:19.390 --> 05:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
disorders uh which have failed standard
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
therapy it also uh we did approve it a
 
05:18:24.628 --> 05:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
few years ago for autism spectrum
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
disorder because we do not have great uh
 
05:18:28.788 --> 05:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
treatments for that and it can be
 
05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
helpful in there at least there's some
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
modest evidence about that so there
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
first of all there are very few minors
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
and the point is for those few miners
 
05:18:41.548 --> 05:18:41.558 align:start position:0%
they par or the legal guardian is their
 
05:18:43.548 --> 05:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
caregiver they're the ones who hold it
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
keep it and give it to the kid to use
 
05:18:47.310 --> 05:18:47.320 align:start position:0%
the kid doesn't just go grab his gummy
 
05:18:49.910 --> 05:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
out of his thing it's not allowed um but
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
but again the bottom line is it's simply
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis is different because of
 
05:18:55.548 --> 05:18:55.558 align:start position:0%
being schedule one therefore it's not
 
05:18:57.470 --> 05:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
prescribed so what's in here is the
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
exception which was is is smart and a
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
good thing it just simply doesn't work
 
05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
for the therapeutic cannabis patients
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that was just an oversight
 
05:19:08.030 --> 05:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
um you know people most people don't
 
05:19:09.310 --> 05:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
think about it think well therapeutic
 
05:19:10.548 --> 05:19:10.558 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient they must have a
 
05:19:12.788 --> 05:19:12.798 align:start position:0%
prescription for it no doesn't work that
 
05:19:14.548 --> 05:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
way because the schedule one so just
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
this other language would make it work
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
and it would again would oh I should say
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
we have roughly about 15,000 patients so
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's not a huge number the great
 
05:19:25.230 --> 05:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
majority are between ages 50 and 60 uh
 
05:19:28.830 --> 05:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
pain is responsible for about 72% of
 
05:19:30.590 --> 05:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's about 72% of the qualifying
 
05:19:33.030 --> 05:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
conditions patients are there are using
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
it for pain so you know it's a lot of
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
people our age as all of us know who
 
05:19:40.590 --> 05:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
have pain and but you know sometimes it
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
can be intractable and it's better than
 
05:19:42.280 --> 05:19:43.830 align:start position:0%
can be intractable and it's better than
using

05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
using
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
opioids representative L
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
cells thank you for taking my
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
question I take a number of
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptions that have my name right on
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
the label as well as the prescription if
 
05:19:59.948 --> 05:19:59.958 align:start position:0%
a person has therapeutic cannabis how is
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
that packaged okay it is in um opaque uh
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's an an opaque uh child resistant
 
05:20:10.708 --> 05:20:10.718 align:start position:0%
Packaging it does have warning labels on
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
it the packaging it is labeled uh that's
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
say that's what makes the program strong
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
is that all therapeutic cannabis
 
05:20:21.070 --> 05:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
products are tested for contaminants and
 
05:20:23.708 --> 05:20:23.718 align:start position:0%
also for the cannaboid profile for the
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
concentration let's say of THC CBD or
 
05:20:28.948 --> 05:20:28.958 align:start position:0%
other canabo and that is all labeled on
 
05:20:31.270 --> 05:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
there so that you know who what what it
 
05:20:33.628 --> 05:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
contains follow up
 
05:20:36.430 --> 05:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
followup is the name of the patient as
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
well as the doctor or whoever whoever
 
05:20:43.350 --> 05:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
decides that this person is eligible is
 
05:20:44.910 --> 05:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
that also on the
 
05:20:48.150 --> 05:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
label I may have to turn to Mr hold is
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
the name of the patient on the
 
05:20:51.480 --> 05:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
the name of the patient on the
label

05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
label
 
05:20:56.990 --> 05:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah s if you if you could you're you're
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
welcome to um to join yes just make sure

question uh all cannabis products uh are

labeled um they do they are not labeled

with the patient's name they are labeled
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
with the patient's registry
 
05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
identification number um they are not
 
05:21:38.190 --> 05:21:38.200 align:start position:0%

05:21:49.150 --> 05:21:49.160 align:start position:0%
these Provisions are Provisions

established in in law um designed I
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
believe uh to protect patient and
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
provider privacy with regard to their
 
05:22:02.750 --> 05:22:02.760 align:start position:0%

actually thank you um anybody else have
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%

you both very much thank you and do feel
 
05:22:20.470 --> 05:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
free to contact us to help with crafting
 
05:22:22.150 --> 05:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
although I think if you put in the words
 
05:22:25.310 --> 05:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
letters RSA and what if you put in
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
RSA I would recommend that you talk to
 
05:22:30.948 --> 05:22:30.958 align:start position:0%
um most likely the sponsors unless
 
05:22:33.910 --> 05:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else here I uh one of the
 
05:22:35.150 --> 05:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
things that I always say at the end of
 
05:22:36.868 --> 05:22:36.878 align:start position:0%
hearings if you hear anything about an
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
amendment I would suggest uh out to the
 
05:22:42.110 --> 05:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors or somebody else because I know
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
that I certainly don't have time to do
 
05:22:43.920 --> 05:22:45.230 align:start position:0%
that I certainly don't have time to do
them

05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:22:48.830 --> 05:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
so all right who else we got up here
 
05:23:00.708 --> 05:23:00.718 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
I started this bill as my senior project
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
um I am an advocate for child welfare
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm also a member of the New
 
05:23:25.628 --> 05:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislative youth advisory
 
05:23:27.430 --> 05:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
Council where I met representative
 
05:23:29.990 --> 05:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
Nelson but more importantly I am here
 
05:23:31.470 --> 05:23:31.480 align:start position:0%
today as someone who has witnessed
 
05:23:33.510 --> 05:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
firsthand the devastating consequences
 
05:23:35.230 --> 05:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
of substance abuse on Children and
 
05:23:37.510 --> 05:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
Families through my senior project I
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
have spent months researching the impact
 
05:23:42.190 --> 05:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
of opioid and methamphetamine abuse on
 
05:23:44.270 --> 05:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
children and our Le legal systems
 
05:23:46.510 --> 05:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
response that research along with my
 
05:23:48.270 --> 05:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
personal experiences has led me to
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 473 a
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
necessary step in protecting our state's
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
most vulnerable residents our children
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
substance abuse particularly Fentanyl
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
and other illicit opioids is devastating
 
05:24:04.190 --> 05:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
families across New Hampshire in 2022
 
05:24:07.590 --> 05:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
alone our state saw 486 confirmed drug
 
05:24:08.948 --> 05:24:08.958 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths
 
05:24:13.150 --> 05:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
410 of them or 85% of those invol
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
involved fentanyl yet our current laws
 
05:24:17.868 --> 05:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
do not reflect the reality of this
 
05:24:22.590 --> 05:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
crisis nhsa 639 a-2 criminalizes
 
05:24:24.190 --> 05:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine production and
 
05:24:26.430 --> 05:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
possession around children but it fails
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
to include Fentanyl and other dangerous
 
05:24:30.430 --> 05:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
opioids despite their overwhelming
 
05:24:33.350 --> 05:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
presence in overdose fatalities this Gap
 
05:24:35.670 --> 05:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the law puts children at unnecessary
 
05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
risk we do not have to look far to see
 
05:24:40.310 --> 05:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the tragic consequences of this
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
oversight as you will hear after me and
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
now in August 2023 a toddler in London
 
05:24:48.990 --> 05:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
Dairy died from fentanyl exposure in
 
05:24:51.270 --> 05:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
September 2024 a 9-month-old in
 
05:24:54.070 --> 05:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
Claremont overdosed and required Naran
 
05:24:55.830 --> 05:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
the following month another 9-month-old
 
05:24:58.070 --> 05:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
in Charlestown overdosed after being
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
exposed to drugs dropped on the floor
 
05:25:02.670 --> 05:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
these are not isolated incidents they
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
are painful reminders that our current
 
05:25:07.150 --> 05:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
protections are not enough children are
 
05:25:09.628 --> 05:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
uniquely vulnerable to opioid exposure
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
even small amounts whether ingested
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
inhaled or absorbed from residue can
 
05:25:16.830 --> 05:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
cause fatal overdoses specifically for
 
05:25:19.548 --> 05:25:19.558 align:start position:0%
fentanyl my research showed that the tip
 
05:25:21.708 --> 05:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
of pencil lead so that small little tip
 
05:25:24.548 --> 05:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
that amount of fentanyl can kill a child
 
05:25:26.590 --> 05:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
Beyond physical harm children living in
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
environments of substance abuse
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
experience severe neglect instability
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
and Trauma when parents are under the
 
05:25:35.548 --> 05:25:35.558 align:start position:0%
influence supervision and Care suffer
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
leaving children in dangerous situations
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
House Bill 473 proposes a simple but
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
critical Amendment expanding the current
 
05:25:45.390 --> 05:25:45.400 align:start position:0%
statute to include Controlled Substances
 
05:25:47.190 --> 05:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
rather than limiting it to
 
05:25:49.350 --> 05:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine this change aligns the
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
law with the realities of today's opioid
 
05:25:53.430 --> 05:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
epidemic while ensuring that valid
 
05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
prescriptions remain protected under RSA
 
05:25:55.840 --> 05:25:57.430 align:start position:0%
prescriptions remain protected under RSA
318

05:25:57.430 --> 05:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
318
 
05:25:59.948 --> 05:25:59.958 align:start position:0%
B1 this bill is not about punishing
 
05:26:02.350 --> 05:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
individuals with substance use disorders
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
it is about protecting the most V
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children who are often left
 
05:26:08.390 --> 05:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
defenseless in dangerous environment
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
ments it also strengthens law
 
05:26:12.270 --> 05:26:12.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement's ability to intervene in
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
cases of suspected exposure by allowing
 
05:26:17.070 --> 05:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
officers to take a child into protective
 
05:26:19.310 --> 05:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
custody for screening and testing we
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
provide a critical tool to ensure that
 
05:26:24.110 --> 05:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
child receive medical attention and
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
necessary support
 
05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
services this aligns with New
 
05:26:29.430 --> 05:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's commitment to child welfare
 
05:26:30.990 --> 05:26:31.000 align:start position:0%
while respecting due process and
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
parental rights it does not mandate
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
removal but establishes immediate
 
05:26:37.708 --> 05:26:37.718 align:start position:0%
assessment of potential harm a necessary
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
safeguard in situations where a child's
 
05:26:42.350 --> 05:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety may be at risk this is
 
05:26:44.948 --> 05:26:44.958 align:start position:0%
not just a policy issue it is a moral
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
imperative we have the opportunity to
 
05:26:49.270 --> 05:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
take action before more children suffer
 
05:26:51.270 --> 05:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
the consequences of a preventable
 
05:26:53.470 --> 05:26:53.480 align:start position:0%
tragedy every child in New Hampshire
 
05:26:55.390 --> 05:26:55.400 align:start position:0%
deserves the right to grow up in a safe
 
05:26:57.750 --> 05:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
and healthy environment I urge you to
 
05:27:00.270 --> 05:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 473 and help us
 
05:27:02.030 --> 05:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
create a safer New Hampshire for all
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
children thank you for your time and
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%

probably heard um former representative
 
05:27:34.990 --> 05:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
kerk's testimony about therapeutic
 
05:27:37.190 --> 05:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
cannabis was it was it your intention
 
05:27:39.310 --> 05:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
that therapeutic canab this be within
 
05:27:41.788 --> 05:27:41.798 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill no my research
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
was only on opioids and the opioid
 
05:27:46.868 --> 05:27:46.878 align:start position:0%
crisis um but working with rep Nelson is
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
when we decided to include that RSA but
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
that was not my sole intention of this
 
05:27:57.190 --> 05:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.310 --> 05:28:00.320 align:start position:0%

was it it was because of your
equipment

05:29:00.230 --> 05:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
05:29:04.788 --> 05:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.150 --> 05:29:07.160 align:start position:0%
load okay anyway thank you for having me
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
all seriousness I know this is no
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
laughing matter thank you I appreciate
 
05:29:11.948 --> 05:29:11.958 align:start position:0%
it you're making feel a little bit more
 
05:29:13.948 --> 05:29:13.958 align:start position:0%
at ease because cuz this is quite an
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
emotional topic for me and um I've
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
watched this uh
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
firsthand uh you know we're at the cold
 
05:29:23.470 --> 05:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
face and I've written a whole bunch of
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
stuff here and I'm going to probably
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
ignore most of it so I just want to talk
 
05:29:28.070 --> 05:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
to you about the truth I've been in law
 
05:29:31.030 --> 05:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement for 14 years um 12 of that
 
05:29:33.030 --> 05:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
has been a chief of police in in the
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
town of Alexandria and prior to that I
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
was a chief of police in danur and then
 
05:29:39.510 --> 05:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
during that I was a chief chief of
 
05:29:41.110 --> 05:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
police in damry and
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
Alexandria um I spent 2 years as a
 
05:29:45.990 --> 05:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
patrol officer before I came chief of
 
05:29:49.548 --> 05:29:49.558 align:start position:0%
police and uh I was 42 when I when I
 
05:29:51.868 --> 05:29:51.878 align:start position:0%
became a police officer so I had some
 
05:29:54.990 --> 05:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
lived experience um before I put on the
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
badge and the gun and uh and I've kind
 
05:29:59.948 --> 05:29:59.958 align:start position:0%
of been there and done that and I'm
 
05:30:01.470 --> 05:30:01.480 align:start position:0%
really sympathetic to people that are in
 
05:30:03.910 --> 05:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
treatment and because of that I I'm on
 
05:30:05.708 --> 05:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
several consortiums in the state one
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
including the uh rural community uh
 
05:30:11.708 --> 05:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
opioid Reduction Program it's a federal
 
05:30:14.830 --> 05:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh Grant by HSA and uh I'm on a
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
Consortium in Lon in that I Pro promote
 
05:30:21.670 --> 05:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
recovery um I'm the Ying to the Yang of
 
05:30:24.190 --> 05:30:24.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement if you will we we will
 
05:30:26.590 --> 05:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
arrest people for drug infractions and
 
05:30:28.270 --> 05:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
we will take them to Recovery in the
 
05:30:30.750 --> 05:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
same day it's incredibly successful for
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
us and I teach about that at a
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
conference every year in DC about
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
integrating law enforcement to recovery
 
05:30:40.510 --> 05:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
efforts it can work but this bill's so
 
05:30:42.750 --> 05:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
important this bill's been around since
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
2006 and and I can only guess is that it
 
05:30:48.670 --> 05:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
was introduced because of um the the
 
05:30:51.628 --> 05:30:51.638 align:start position:0%
homecooked um methamphetamine back there
 
05:30:53.190 --> 05:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
well that that's not happening as much
 
05:30:54.548 --> 05:30:54.558 align:start position:0%
anymore because there's so much
 
05:30:56.590 --> 05:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine in the state that's
 
05:30:58.110 --> 05:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
coming in from
 
05:31:00.708 --> 05:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
Mexico or Southern States I'm I'm not
 
05:31:02.110 --> 05:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
going to elaborate on that that's
 
05:31:04.150 --> 05:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
outside my skill set but I want to talk
 
05:31:07.030 --> 05:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
to you about um also say that I support
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
this spell I think that's given and I'm
 
05:31:10.628 --> 05:31:10.638 align:start position:0%
here actually representing New Hampshire
 
05:31:12.590 --> 05:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association as well and
 
05:31:15.270 --> 05:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
they support this bill um I want to talk
 
05:31:16.788 --> 05:31:16.798 align:start position:0%
to you about a case that I was involved
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
in it was down in London Derry two
 
05:31:20.350 --> 05:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
parents had decided one night two
 
05:31:22.030 --> 05:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
parents and another adult had decided
 
05:31:23.510 --> 05:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
one night that they they' take a
 
05:31:25.548 --> 05:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
four-wheeler and take a trip down to
 
05:31:27.750 --> 05:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and swap that four-wheeler
 
05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
for fenel um and they did they went down
 
05:31:32.350 --> 05:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts swapped this
 
05:31:34.868 --> 05:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
fourwheeler picked up some fenyl and uh
 
05:31:36.430 --> 05:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
they were from around our area around
 
05:31:39.190 --> 05:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
the Lakes Region and they made it as far
 
05:31:41.230 --> 05:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
back as London dery before they they
 
05:31:44.868 --> 05:31:44.878 align:start position:0%
felt the use to the urge to use their um
 
05:31:47.510 --> 05:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
fenel uh they used it they fell asleep
 
05:31:49.270 --> 05:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
and their toddler ate it and that
 
05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
toddler died and
 
05:31:55.270 --> 05:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh and I spent quite a bit of time
 
05:31:57.548 --> 05:31:57.558 align:start position:0%
working uh to find those people once
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
that case was presented to a grand jury
 
05:32:02.030 --> 05:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and I worked with the US Marshals to
 
05:32:03.830 --> 05:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
find several of those individuals around
 
05:32:07.350 --> 05:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
the state um they're since serving long
 
05:32:09.788 --> 05:32:09.798 align:start position:0%
long jail sentences but their family
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
will never be the same and and I'm sure
 
05:32:15.750 --> 05:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
they regret it every single day um I
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
worked another case in in a small town
 
05:32:21.190 --> 05:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
where we were um investigating this
 
05:32:22.948 --> 05:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
house for the possession of
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine and I know that there
 
05:32:27.390 --> 05:32:27.400 align:start position:0%
was two small children in that house and
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
they were going to a local school and as
 
05:32:31.430 --> 05:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
part of being a community orientated
 
05:32:33.670 --> 05:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
police officer I would go to the school
 
05:32:36.548 --> 05:32:36.558 align:start position:0%
often and we see these kids asleep and
 
05:32:38.910 --> 05:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
as part of our our case that we were
 
05:32:41.470 --> 05:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
building on this house and the sales of
 
05:32:44.350 --> 05:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
the methamphetamine out of that house um
 
05:32:46.628 --> 05:32:46.638 align:start position:0%
I would watch the house uh you know it's
 
05:32:48.868 --> 05:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
in my community it wasn't far I would
 
05:32:50.990 --> 05:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
drive around at all hours of the night
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
and we would see this house was awake
 
05:32:55.110 --> 05:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
all night and these kids were suffering
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
and and not just a little bit they were
 
05:32:59.350 --> 05:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
suffering hard the schooling was their
 
05:33:02.990 --> 05:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
escape and um they need to get out of
 
05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
that house we we arrested um both
 
05:33:09.270 --> 05:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
parties and got DC if there to help us
 
05:33:10.990 --> 05:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
with the investigation and the
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent cleanup that the children
 
05:33:15.788 --> 05:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
were taken they were tested um we never
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
found out the results of the test it
 
05:33:19.470 --> 05:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't for us to find out it was more of
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
a DCF issue within a couple of weeks
 
05:33:24.708 --> 05:33:24.718 align:start position:0%
those kids were back at school uh a
 
05:33:27.070 --> 05:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
young male was talking conversing and
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
they were learning again and these kids
 
05:33:30.670 --> 05:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
put on weight and they're doing great
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
ever since
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
um uh Tess uh talked earlier about a
 
05:33:39.310 --> 05:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
9-month old that was reved during Naran
 
05:33:40.110 --> 05:33:40.120 align:start position:0%
up in
 
05:33:42.868 --> 05:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
Claremont the amount of feny that it
 
05:33:44.430 --> 05:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
takes I know T talked to this the amount
 
05:33:46.110 --> 05:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
of feny that it takes to kill a small
 
05:33:49.350 --> 05:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
child is is nothing it's next to nothing
 
05:33:51.868 --> 05:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
and yet this is a highly Airborne drug
 
05:33:54.350 --> 05:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
that is easily ingested by by young
 
05:33:56.868 --> 05:33:56.878 align:start position:0%
children I myself was was exposed to
 
05:33:59.310 --> 05:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
fenyl uh a long time ago I'm not going
 
05:34:00.990 --> 05:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
to age myself but it was one of the
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
first exposures to law enforcement uh in
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
the country the CDC came out and did a
 
05:34:07.230 --> 05:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of testing on me I was fine
 
05:34:09.190 --> 05:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
it was an exposure but it's significant
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
um we we want this bill to pass because
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
we want more Tools in our tool belt to
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
help the family this isn't necessarily
 
05:34:24.990 --> 05:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
about prosecution but it comes as a law
 
05:34:26.830 --> 05:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
so obviously there's consequences to
 
05:34:29.548 --> 05:34:29.558 align:start position:0%
that but we want to help these kids cuz
 
05:34:32.350 --> 05:34:32.360 align:start position:0%
our kids future isn't negotiable neither
 
05:34:35.350 --> 05:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
is their safety so I welcome any
 
05:34:41.670 --> 05:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:45.708 --> 05:34:45.718 align:start position:0%

convenience I apologize for the
 
05:35:54.910 --> 05:35:54.920 align:start position:0%

represent Rockingham second district uh
 
05:36:05.070 --> 05:36:05.080 align:start position:0%

05:36:07.708 --> 05:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
the towns of Auburn Candia and dear
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
field the words in the head go faster
 
05:36:11.350 --> 05:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
than the words that come out of my mouth
 
05:36:14.590 --> 05:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
so um you'll you'll hear funny things
 
05:36:16.470 --> 05:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
every now and then so I apologize for
 
05:36:16.480 --> 05:36:18.430 align:start position:0%
every now and then so I apologize for
that

05:36:18.430 --> 05:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:21.788 --> 05:36:21.798 align:start position:0%
um the thing I want to start out
 
05:36:26.030 --> 05:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
with is this bill is not about
 
05:36:28.470 --> 05:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
amphetamines it's not about barbituates
 
05:36:32.310 --> 05:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's not about narcotics it's not about
 
05:36:36.470 --> 05:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
opioids right those are highly addictive
 
05:36:39.510 --> 05:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
highly dangerous and potentially deadly
 
05:36:42.548 --> 05:36:42.558 align:start position:0%
drugs and and they should be schedule
 
05:36:46.548 --> 05:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
one drugs they should be very tightly
 
05:36:48.830 --> 05:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
controlled what I've come to talk to you
 
05:36:53.788 --> 05:36:53.798 align:start position:0%
about today is a psychedelics bill and
 
05:36:57.470 --> 05:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
so we have to learn to compromise right
 
05:36:59.948 --> 05:36:59.958 align:start position:0%
and so two years ago this bill uh came
 
05:37:01.750 --> 05:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
before this commit actually can I back
 
05:37:04.270 --> 05:37:04.280 align:start position:0%
up one second I want to apologize to the
 
05:37:07.708 --> 05:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
committee you um had a sister Bill to to
 
05:37:09.708 --> 05:37:09.718 align:start position:0%
this which was a a cannabis bill
 
05:37:11.990 --> 05:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically the same language but cannabis
 
05:37:13.948 --> 05:37:13.958 align:start position:0%
that was my bill and and I was not able
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
to introduce it I got called out of
 
05:37:19.030 --> 05:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
state um on un unexpected business and
 
05:37:21.350 --> 05:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I I couldn't be here so I I apologize
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
for not being here for that for that
 
05:37:24.430 --> 05:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
that bill I just wanted to make sure
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
that that that got said so two years ago
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
I filed a a bill that uh wanted to uh
 
05:37:34.190 --> 05:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
decriminalize at the state level um
 
05:37:37.548 --> 05:37:37.558 align:start position:0%
several uh psychedelics um I search a
 
05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
aciid damid LSD mesculin and peyote um
 
05:37:45.868 --> 05:37:45.878 align:start position:0%
and cybin right so um those those were
 
05:37:45.878 --> 05:37:46.708 align:start position:0%
and cybin right so um those those were
the

05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:37:49.230 --> 05:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
three it it was it was a fun little
 
05:37:51.350 --> 05:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
debate that we had both at the committee
 
05:37:53.868 --> 05:37:53.878 align:start position:0%
level and at the floor of the house and
 
05:37:56.430 --> 05:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I was really shocked because on the
 
05:37:57.868 --> 05:37:57.878 align:start position:0%
floor of the
 
05:38:01.190 --> 05:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
house on an itl bill I got 40% of the
 
05:38:03.670 --> 05:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
votes that I needed to pass it and and
 
05:38:05.868 --> 05:38:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty big bite at the Apple
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
right I'm you know I'm I'm smart enough
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
to know that uh going after all three is
 
05:38:10.990 --> 05:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
is a big
 
05:38:13.548 --> 05:38:13.558 align:start position:0%
bite and and I got a lot of feedback
 
05:38:15.510 --> 05:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
from people that were sympathetic but
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
didn't vote in favor and and so what
 
05:38:19.548 --> 05:38:19.558 align:start position:0%
I've what I've done this year is I've
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
rolled this back to only be psilocin
 
05:38:26.590 --> 05:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
psilocybin is the active ingredient in
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
magic mushrooms right what they call
 
05:38:31.750 --> 05:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
magic mushrooms psychedelic
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
mushrooms psychedelic mushrooms grow in
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
all 50 states they they grow on all
 
05:38:42.670 --> 05:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
continents except for Antarctica so so
 
05:38:44.788 --> 05:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
psychedelic mushrooms psilocybin
 
05:38:47.548 --> 05:38:47.558 align:start position:0%
mushrooms are are quite ubiquitous
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
globally they've been used for uh
 
05:38:52.548 --> 05:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of
 
05:38:55.150 --> 05:38:55.160 align:start position:0%
years uh some people would say they they
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
are abused um and and I suppose at some
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
level uh they are subject to abuse one
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
thing we should know about soloc cybin
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
is there's um no effectively no ld50 so
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
an ld50 is a lethal dose that'll kill
 
05:39:14.390 --> 05:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
50% of a given population so uh
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
typically they use a um kilogram rat
 
05:39:19.468 --> 05:39:19.478 align:start position:0%
right a two pound rat and and and do it
 
05:39:19.478 --> 05:39:20.230 align:start position:0%
right a two pound rat and and and do it
by

05:39:20.230 --> 05:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
by
 
05:39:23.150 --> 05:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
that the only way to kill a a rat with
 
05:39:24.830 --> 05:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
cocy and you'd have to have enough of it
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
to drop it on its head and crush it okay
 
05:39:30.110 --> 05:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
the other thing that's interesting is
 
05:39:33.510 --> 05:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
that you can't overdose on
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
psilocybin you can take a lot um you
 
05:39:39.310 --> 05:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
know you can you can lose your your your
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
lucidness but you you can't take enough
 
05:39:44.510 --> 05:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
psilocybin to to to kill yourself right
 
05:39:47.230 --> 05:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
so that that's not a reality another
 
05:39:50.150 --> 05:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about uh virtually all
 
05:39:52.190 --> 05:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
psychedelics is they're they're not
 
05:39:55.628 --> 05:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
habit forming and they're not prone to
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
um short cycle repetitive use right so
 
05:40:00.788 --> 05:40:00.798 align:start position:0%
if you think about um the way
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
amphetamines barbituates Etc work um you
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
take the drug you get a high uh you come
 
05:40:06.670 --> 05:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
down off the high you want to do it
 
05:40:07.788 --> 05:40:07.798 align:start position:0%
again you have to take take a little bit
 
05:40:09.708 --> 05:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
more cuzz your body built up a little
 
05:40:11.788 --> 05:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
little bit of Tolerance and and so then
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
you're on that cycle right a little more
 
05:40:14.430 --> 05:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
a little more a little more a little
 
05:40:16.750 --> 05:40:16.760 align:start position:0%
more next thing you know it the drug
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
controls your life so if we all got
 
05:40:21.468 --> 05:40:21.478 align:start position:0%
together and and obviously we wouldn't
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
do this because it's illegal but if we
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
all got together and and had a a
 
05:40:26.990 --> 05:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
psychedelic mushroom Experience Saturday
 
05:40:29.150 --> 05:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
night and some of you woke up Sunday
 
05:40:31.110 --> 05:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
morning and said wow I really want to do
 
05:40:34.030 --> 05:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
that again what you would find is if you
 
05:40:37.390 --> 05:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
did the same dose or more you would not
 
05:40:39.190 --> 05:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
get the same
 
05:40:42.030 --> 05:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
effect and so if you said gez you know
 
05:40:43.190 --> 05:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
that wasn't as good as the first time
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take twice as much you'll
 
05:40:47.670 --> 05:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually get less of effect than you did
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
on on Sunday so the more often you do it
 
05:40:53.270 --> 05:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
in a short amount of time the less the
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
effect it has so it's not it's not prone
 
05:40:58.430 --> 05:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
to addictive behavior okay just very
 
05:40:59.948 --> 05:40:59.958 align:start position:0%
important things that we we should know
 
05:40:59.958 --> 05:41:03.310 align:start position:0%
important things that we we should know
about

05:41:03.310 --> 05:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:06.468 --> 05:41:06.478 align:start position:0%
this what this would do is it would
 
05:41:06.478 --> 05:41:08.350 align:start position:0%
this what this would do is it would
decriminalize

05:41:08.350 --> 05:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
decriminalize
 
05:41:12.270 --> 05:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
I psilocybin and psilocybin
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
containing fungus in the state of New
 
05:41:18.030 --> 05:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it would not remove it from
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
schedule one which is a federal law and
 
05:41:24.708 --> 05:41:24.718 align:start position:0%
so ferally it would remain
 
05:41:27.270 --> 05:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
illegal and so what this does what this
 
05:41:30.468 --> 05:41:30.478 align:start position:0%
bill is is harm
 
05:41:32.990 --> 05:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
prevention most of the people that get
 
05:41:36.750 --> 05:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
caught with psychedelics are young this
 
05:41:39.548 --> 05:41:39.558 align:start position:0%
bill is 21 and over but they tend to be
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
younger in life and the conviction is a
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
felony and a felony conviction has
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
longlasting negative repercussions on a
 
05:41:52.270 --> 05:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
person's life so if you accidentally got
 
05:41:54.510 --> 05:41:54.520 align:start position:0%
caught with my psychedelics he couldn't
 
05:41:55.948 --> 05:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
become a school teacher it'd be tough to
 
05:41:58.190 --> 05:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
get a license to do that all all sorts
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
of different things so it it removes the
 
05:42:02.670 --> 05:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
the felony
 
05:42:04.830 --> 05:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
conviction and so some people would say
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
well then we're going to have mushrooms
 
05:42:09.390 --> 05:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
rampant right two years ago the state
 
05:42:12.468 --> 05:42:12.478 align:start position:0%
police Lieutenant um who's in charge of
 
05:42:14.270 --> 05:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh the drug Division I forget exactly
 
05:42:15.468 --> 05:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
what they call
 
05:42:18.990 --> 05:42:19.000 align:start position:0%
it testified and he was asked you know
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
hey how many how many times do you
 
05:42:22.030 --> 05:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
arrest people for psychedelics
 
05:42:23.548 --> 05:42:23.558 align:start position:0%
possession and he couldn't he couldn't
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
remember the last time but his testimony
 
05:42:28.468 --> 05:42:28.478 align:start position:0%
went on to say that he had a child in
 
05:42:30.670 --> 05:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
high school and the child in high school
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
says they are readily available
 
05:42:34.468 --> 05:42:34.478 align:start position:0%
everywhere so the pro prohibition
 
05:42:37.230 --> 05:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't work right the the material is
 
05:42:37.240 --> 05:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
doesn't work right the the material is
is

05:42:38.390 --> 05:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
available what I want to do is remove
 
05:42:45.350 --> 05:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
the penalty the the felony penalty for
 
05:42:47.948 --> 05:42:47.958 align:start position:0%
the for the possession and that's what
 
05:42:49.390 --> 05:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
this bill does you say okay well now
 
05:42:51.590 --> 05:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to run rampant right you can
 
05:42:53.150 --> 05:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
imagine that somebody's now going to
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
mass-produced mushrooms in their in
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
their basement to sell um on what would
 
05:42:59.230 --> 05:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
essentially be a legal Market in New
 
05:43:00.990 --> 05:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Black Market in other states
 
05:43:03.150 --> 05:43:03.160 align:start position:0%
but but that's not going to happen and
 
05:43:04.750 --> 05:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
the reason that's not going to happen is
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
the feds aren't going to allow that
 
05:43:08.670 --> 05:43:08.680 align:start position:0%
right the federal authorities are not
 
05:43:10.150 --> 05:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
going to allow mass production of
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
psychedelic mushrooms so they're they're
 
05:43:15.350 --> 05:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
not going to allow commercial sales so
 
05:43:16.830 --> 05:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
if you say well all of a sudden you know
 
05:43:18.830 --> 05:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire allows for for sale which
 
05:43:20.750 --> 05:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
technically this bill would do if you
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
opened up a psychedelic mushroom shop I
 
05:43:25.830 --> 05:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
guarantee you by the second day you open
 
05:43:27.830 --> 05:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
your door uh there's going to be black
 
05:43:29.990 --> 05:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
shiny shoes at your doorstep asking you
 
05:43:31.670 --> 05:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions and probably asking
 
05:43:34.708 --> 05:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
you to go with them right so so while
 
05:43:37.628 --> 05:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
this bill seems Broad in scope it it
 
05:43:40.150 --> 05:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
really isn't it's just trying to to
 
05:43:42.390 --> 05:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
allow some some harm
 
05:43:46.468 --> 05:43:46.478 align:start position:0%
prevention um for for New Hampshire
 
05:43:50.628 --> 05:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
citizens I I dream of a day when we have
 
05:43:53.670 --> 05:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
medical psychedelics available I dream
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
of that day I there
 
05:43:58.430 --> 05:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
are demonstrated medical
 
05:44:02.270 --> 05:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
benefits with um depression
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
syndrome interestingly enough addiction
 
05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
right so psychedelics can be used to
 
05:44:12.990 --> 05:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
cure addiction to a very high rate and
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the most interesting part is right
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with this the way
 
05:44:20.590 --> 05:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
psychedelic therapy works for
 
05:44:22.468 --> 05:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
essentially all of these these different
 
05:44:26.708 --> 05:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
issues is a single high does experience
 
05:44:29.310 --> 05:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
with medical personnel right so you
 
05:44:32.868 --> 05:44:32.878 align:start position:0%
counseling experience counseling and it
 
05:44:35.788 --> 05:44:35.798 align:start position:0%
has a huge success rate we we are a long
 
05:44:37.390 --> 05:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
ways from that right we're still we're
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
still arguing about medical cannabis in
 
05:44:39.638 --> 05:44:41.070 align:start position:0%
still arguing about medical cannabis in
the

05:44:41.070 --> 05:44:41.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
state so in in lie of that I would
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage this
 
05:44:52.468 --> 05:44:52.478 align:start position:0%
committee to vote this uh OTP so we can
 
05:44:55.910 --> 05:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
have a debate on the floor of the
 
05:44:58.868 --> 05:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
house let's at least have the open
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
debate people are are our constituents
 
05:45:03.948 --> 05:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
are very open to this the polling
 
05:45:07.070 --> 05:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
numbers keep going up if you're against
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
it you can still you can still give it
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
an OP OTP out of committee because when
 
05:45:14.510 --> 05:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
it when it crosses to the other side of
 
05:45:14.520 --> 05:45:15.190 align:start position:0%
it when it crosses to the other side of
the

05:45:15.190 --> 05:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:45:18.750 --> 05:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
wall or if by by some miracle of God it
 
05:45:21.628 --> 05:45:21.638 align:start position:0%
it it escaped that other body uh it'll
 
05:45:23.670 --> 05:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
it'll end up in a corner office where
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
you know it it doesn't have a lot of
 
05:45:27.750 --> 05:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
future but I think I think it's a
 
05:45:29.708 --> 05:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's a debate that we
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
really need to to start having in an in
 
05:45:34.150 --> 05:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
an honest forthright
 
05:45:37.270 --> 05:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
Manner and so that's why I I bring this
 
05:45:39.750 --> 05:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill to you thank you madam chair thank
 
05:45:42.708 --> 05:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
you representative representative n
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:45:46.990 --> 05:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I have followed
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
your your um bills around um psychedelic
 
05:45:53.070 --> 05:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics and things like that and um
 
05:45:54.990 --> 05:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
I didn't see one this year and I'm
 
05:45:58.628 --> 05:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
curious why um why you chose to go this
 
05:46:01.070 --> 05:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
way instead of trying to push forward
 
05:46:04.430 --> 05:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic um the therapeutic
 
05:46:04.440 --> 05:46:05.910 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic um the therapeutic
psychedelics

05:46:05.910 --> 05:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
psychedelics
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill thank you for the question so so
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
the representative has decided she's
 
05:46:14.510 --> 05:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
going to blow my cover and I'll give you
 
05:46:16.670 --> 05:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'll give am I yeah you are and I I'll
 
05:46:19.350 --> 05:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
give you it's not a it's not a secret um
 
05:46:21.990 --> 05:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
although I don't broadcast it it's a
 
05:46:22.000 --> 05:46:23.350 align:start position:0%
although I don't broadcast it it's a
two-year

05:46:23.350 --> 05:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
two-year
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
session when this bill dies wherever it
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
dies because that's what's going to
 
05:46:30.510 --> 05:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
happen to it right
 
05:46:34.628 --> 05:46:34.638 align:start position:0%
eventually it can't come back next year
 
05:46:37.270 --> 05:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
right so
 
05:46:39.150 --> 05:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
similar language you could take a
 
05:46:40.590 --> 05:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
different approach to it in the second
 
05:46:42.310 --> 05:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
year but not the same
 
05:46:46.590 --> 05:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
approach so if if there's a cake to be
 
05:46:49.708 --> 05:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
had and you have two chances to eat the
 
05:46:53.070 --> 05:46:53.080 align:start position:0%
cake it's always worth it's like a pie
 
05:46:55.030 --> 05:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
eating contest right if I could eat the
 
05:46:58.990 --> 05:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
pie in one bite that's preferable to um
 
05:47:01.990 --> 05:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
having to nibble away at it this is this
 
05:47:03.070 --> 05:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
is the Big
 
05:47:03.080 --> 05:47:05.150 align:start position:0%
is the Big
Bite

05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
Bite
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
right I don't know that I will be
 
05:47:10.670 --> 05:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
bringing a therapeutic Bill forward next
 
05:47:13.310 --> 05:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
year uh but I am quite certain that
 
05:47:16.830 --> 05:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
there are individuals that that will um
 
05:47:20.110 --> 05:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
so you you will you will see that and I
 
05:47:21.868 --> 05:47:21.878 align:start position:0%
think that's a worthy
 
05:47:25.868 --> 05:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
Bill what I would beg this committee is
 
05:47:29.230 --> 05:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
to not give this an itl
 
05:47:32.708 --> 05:47:32.718 align:start position:0%
recommendation knowing fairly certainly
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
that there'll be um a therapeutic bill
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
if I can give you a more thorough answer
 
05:47:41.070 --> 05:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
the the reason I say that is we are not
 
05:47:43.510 --> 05:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
in alignment as to what therapeutic
 
05:47:46.510 --> 05:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
psychedelic should look like so in the
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
1950s in the early 1960s when
 
05:47:51.468 --> 05:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
psychedelics were perfectly legal
 
05:47:54.628 --> 05:47:54.638 align:start position:0%
globally Nevada is actually the state
 
05:47:56.788 --> 05:47:56.798 align:start position:0%
that began the clamp down California
 
05:47:58.990 --> 05:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
went second and then the feds intervened
 
05:48:01.468 --> 05:48:01.478 align:start position:0%
and they slammed it all shut all the
 
05:48:04.030 --> 05:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
therapy all the research everything and
 
05:48:06.390 --> 05:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
back then you had Hollywood stars going
 
05:48:09.430 --> 05:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
to Boutique medical facilities getting
 
05:48:09.440 --> 05:48:10.708 align:start position:0%
to Boutique medical facilities getting
psychedelic

05:48:10.708 --> 05:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
psychedelic
 
05:48:13.750 --> 05:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
treatments and so if you're rich and you
 
05:48:17.390 --> 05:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:21.990 --> 05:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
access I don't like that model right I
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
I'm here for the little guy I'm I'm not
 
05:48:27.030 --> 05:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
here for for for for elite hardto
 
05:48:27.040 --> 05:48:28.510 align:start position:0%
here for for for for elite hardto
penetrate

05:48:28.510 --> 05:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
penetrate
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
systems and I'm afraid that if we go
 
05:48:34.350 --> 05:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
psychedelics therapy that that's
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
probably going to be the first nibble
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
that pass
 
05:48:39.110 --> 05:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it's going to be very
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
difficult to open it up beyond that um
 
05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
and and that that scares me that also so
 
05:48:47.590 --> 05:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
now you have this legal venue right for
 
05:48:48.750 --> 05:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
those that can afford it because the
 
05:48:49.910 --> 05:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
insurance isn't going to cover it you're
 
05:48:51.510 --> 05:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
gon to have to pay out of pocket right
 
05:48:52.350 --> 05:48:52.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance isn't going to cover
 
05:48:54.788 --> 05:48:54.798 align:start position:0%
psychedelic therapy in in New Hampshire
 
05:48:54.798 --> 05:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
psychedelic therapy in in New Hampshire
almost

05:48:56.310 --> 05:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
almost
 
05:48:59.468 --> 05:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
certainly and so now you still got the
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
average Joe and average Jane subject to
 
05:49:05.310 --> 05:49:05.320 align:start position:0%
penalty felony penalties I don't know
 
05:49:07.430 --> 05:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
why I can't say that today
 
05:49:10.510 --> 05:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
Fen felony penalty say that three times
 
05:49:13.990 --> 05:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
fast um thank you for something that's
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
available to to to others that that can
 
05:49:18.948 --> 05:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
afford the Buy in to me this is a better
 
05:49:20.830 --> 05:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
better solution this is a better solu
 
05:49:23.230 --> 05:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
it's still federally illegal and and I I
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
I will make the commitment that if this
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
bill passes by the grace of God and all
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
of a sudden we have a magic mushroom
 
05:49:32.788 --> 05:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
problem in this state I will be the
 
05:49:35.430 --> 05:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
first one to run back to this committee
 
05:49:37.350 --> 05:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
and bring common sense
 
05:49:39.830 --> 05:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to tighten it up to bring it
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
back under control but I already know
 
05:49:44.830 --> 05:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
that psychedelics are readily available
 
05:49:47.510 --> 05:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
in all 50 states at very competitive
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
prices on the black market so the
 
05:49:52.030 --> 05:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition does is doing nothing and
 
05:49:54.310 --> 05:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
the people that are getting caught are
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
not fentanyl addicts they're not cocaine
 
05:49:58.150 --> 05:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
addicts they're they're not
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
methampetamine addicts um they're
 
05:50:02.310 --> 05:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're there people that are either
 
05:50:04.948 --> 05:50:04.958 align:start position:0%
looking to explore their inner self uh
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
or their their self-medicated for for
 
05:50:10.750 --> 05:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
other reasons long long answer thank you
 
05:50:10.760 --> 05:50:11.750 align:start position:0%
other reasons long long answer thank you
thank

05:50:11.750 --> 05:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.830 --> 05:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
Muse would it surprise you to know that
 
05:50:21.750 --> 05:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
while I oppose outright
 
05:50:23.510 --> 05:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
legalization I would be more than
 
05:50:25.350 --> 05:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
willing to work with somebody on a
 
05:50:28.070 --> 05:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic bill because over the last
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
few years I've seen a huge amount of
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
research that indicates that this may
 
05:50:36.628 --> 05:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
actually be a tremendously beneficial
 
05:50:39.868 --> 05:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
form of therapy but the reality is is
 
05:50:43.390 --> 05:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
that no therapeutic version of
 
05:50:45.548 --> 05:50:45.558 align:start position:0%
psilocybin has been approved for human
 
05:50:45.558 --> 05:50:50.070 align:start position:0%
psilocybin has been approved for human
consumption

05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:52.270 --> 05:50:52.280 align:start position:0%
yet I'm going to assume that's in the
 
05:50:54.708 --> 05:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
form of a question thank
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
you so I I I thank I thank you for the
 
05:51:01.868 --> 05:51:01.878 align:start position:0%
question so the the
 
05:51:06.030 --> 05:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
FDA has not approved psychedelic therapy
 
05:51:08.868 --> 05:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
for Broad band use it is only in the
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
last couple of decades that they have
 
05:51:15.190 --> 05:51:15.200 align:start position:0%
allowed very limited very limited um
 
05:51:18.590 --> 05:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
ability to to run trials to run clinical
 
05:51:22.590 --> 05:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
trials and do research there is a huge
 
05:51:25.910 --> 05:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
body of research from the 1950s and the
 
05:51:29.110 --> 05:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
1960s publicly available right it's it's
 
05:51:31.548 --> 05:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
it was all published in medical journals
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
the research that's being done today is
 
05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
piggybacked on on on that work right
 
05:51:38.110 --> 05:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're standing on the the
 
05:51:41.510 --> 05:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
shoulders of giants in my opinion the
 
05:51:46.190 --> 05:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
the FDA is is not likely to um Embrace
 
05:51:49.350 --> 05:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
psychedelic therapy anytime soon mostly
 
05:51:52.468 --> 05:51:52.478 align:start position:0%
because it's the federal um monolith
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
right that's very hard to crack so I I
 
05:51:56.670 --> 05:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
think we're better off approaching it at
 
05:51:59.110 --> 05:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
the state at the state
 
05:52:02.910 --> 05:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
level I I understand I understand your
 
05:52:06.510 --> 05:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
position I I'm still going to beg you to
 
05:52:09.110 --> 05:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
to give me an OTP so we can at least
 
05:52:12.270 --> 05:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
have um a nice floor debate to to start
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
getting people thinking about this a
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
little bit differently um I I guarantee
 
05:52:19.548 --> 05:52:19.558 align:start position:0%
you um if there's a Therapeutics Bill
 
05:52:22.548 --> 05:52:22.558 align:start position:0%
next year and there will be um I I will
 
05:52:26.510 --> 05:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
be I will be working with people on that
 
05:52:28.590 --> 05:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
um and what I would what I would ask is
 
05:52:30.510 --> 05:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
that you remember my words of caution
 
05:52:34.110 --> 05:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't set up a a system um that
 
05:52:36.830 --> 05:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
allows the halves to have and and the
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
have knots to to be locked out of access
 
05:52:41.910 --> 05:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
because that that was the major problem
 
05:52:45.468 --> 05:52:45.478 align:start position:0%
with the the the clinical side in the in
 
05:52:48.670 --> 05:52:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
60s I'm I'm pretty sure we're going to
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
need subs next week representative veral
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
if you're you know volunteering
 
05:52:57.868 --> 05:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
I'm so I appreciate the offer
 
05:53:00.670 --> 05:53:00.680 align:start position:0%

team of the company I work for is is
 
05:53:04.548 --> 05:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
traveling next week and so I'm clamped
 
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
down pretty
 
05:53:09.310 --> 05:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
I don't see any further questions thank
 
05:53:10.910 --> 05:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much thank you
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate the
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:27.590 --> 05:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
pette hi guys I'm representative
 
05:53:30.190 --> 05:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
Kathleen pette from Manchester and I'm
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
one of the uh the little guys that he
 
05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
was referring to
 
05:53:36.430 --> 05:53:36.440 align:start position:0%
earlier um today I'm going to share some
 
05:53:37.868 --> 05:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
something with all of you that's deeply
 
05:53:39.868 --> 05:53:39.878 align:start position:0%
personal to me uh it's a side of me I
 
05:53:41.590 --> 05:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
don't share too often and usually only
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
with those that I'm closest to I want to
 
05:53:44.990 --> 05:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
share with you the most intimate part of
 
05:53:46.430 --> 05:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
my life my
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
pain um I may look fine on a day-to-day
 
05:53:51.628 --> 05:53:51.638 align:start position:0%
basis and sometimes I am but often I'm
 
05:53:53.708 --> 05:53:53.718 align:start position:0%
not I've often been told it can't be
 
05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
that bad you look fine my unfortunate
 
05:53:59.468 --> 05:53:59.478 align:start position:0%
reality is that I'm anything but fine
 
05:54:01.350 --> 05:54:01.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to just pass this one
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:14.910 --> 05:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
I suffer from a chronic excruciating
 
05:54:17.670 --> 05:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
pain condition called trigeminal calgia
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
also known as cluster headache they're
 
05:54:21.590 --> 05:54:21.600 align:start position:0%
called cluster headaches because they
 
05:54:24.150 --> 05:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
tend to cycle and come in clusters when
 
05:54:26.628 --> 05:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
I'm in cycle I have unbearable attacks
 
05:54:28.910 --> 05:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
of burning piercing stabbing pain behind
 
05:54:32.430 --> 05:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
my eye the pain is so violently severe
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
that I cry I rock I pace and I usually
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
end up rolling around on the the floor
 
05:54:39.788 --> 05:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
clutching my head and sobbing my nose
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
runs my eye swells and it's not unusual
 
05:54:45.150 --> 05:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
vomiting the attack of pain can last
 
05:54:50.590 --> 05:54:50.600 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 10 minutes to 3
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
hours they can occur several times in
 
05:54:53.200 --> 05:54:54.310 align:start position:0%
hours they can occur several times in
one

05:54:54.310 --> 05:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:54:56.670 --> 05:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
night just when I'm exhausted enough to
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
sleep it starts all over again this
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
often happens every night for months at
 
05:55:02.000 --> 05:55:02.990 align:start position:0%
often happens every night for months at
a

05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:55:05.070 --> 05:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
time there have been times where I
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
haven't had a good night's sleep for
 
05:55:11.548 --> 05:55:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:11.558 --> 05:55:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
year

05:55:13.990 --> 05:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
sorry um I've personally broken multiple
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
bones gave birth to multiple babies
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
experienced kidney stones and had
 
05:55:22.670 --> 05:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
several surgeries I have yet to
 
05:55:24.670 --> 05:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
experience anything more painful than a
 
05:55:24.680 --> 05:55:25.830 align:start position:0%
experience anything more painful than a
cluster

05:55:25.830 --> 05:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
cluster
 
05:55:29.070 --> 05:55:29.080 align:start position:0%
attack Tylenol Advil migraine meds don't
 
05:55:31.070 --> 05:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
put the slightest dent in these attacks
 
05:55:33.590 --> 05:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
IV pain medication such as morphine or
 
05:55:35.310 --> 05:55:35.320 align:start position:0%
diloted don't even come close to
 
05:55:38.390 --> 05:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
touching it my only tool for shortening
 
05:55:40.150 --> 05:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
the duration of these attacks is high
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
flow oxygen using a special mask I have
 
05:55:45.468 --> 05:55:45.478 align:start position:0%
an oxygen tank almost as tall as I am
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
besides my
 
05:55:49.830 --> 05:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
bed cluster headaches are unfortunately
 
05:55:52.270 --> 05:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
a well underdiagnosed condition because
 
05:55:54.468 --> 05:55:54.478 align:start position:0%
it's just not so well known and it can
 
05:55:56.468 --> 05:55:56.478 align:start position:0%
take up to 10 years to get a correct
 
05:55:58.590 --> 05:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis I unfortunately remember my
 
05:56:01.910 --> 05:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
first cluster headache very well I was 5
 
05:56:04.548 --> 05:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
years old I was finally correctly
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosed at the age of 38
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
I unfortunately don't remember a time in
 
05:56:12.750 --> 05:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
my life when pain wasn't part of
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
it these are considered one of the most
 
05:56:17.150 --> 05:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
painful disorders and are Al often
 
05:56:20.310 --> 05:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
called suicide headaches because over
 
05:56:23.230 --> 05:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
70% of people with my condition
 
05:56:26.708 --> 05:56:26.718 align:start position:0%
contemplate ending it all suicide in my
 
05:56:30.270 --> 05:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
population is over 20 times the national
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
average way too many of way too many
 
05:56:35.510 --> 05:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
members of my cluster headache family
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
were unfort for no longer able to see
 
05:56:40.150 --> 05:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
past the pain and they're no longer with
 
05:56:43.350 --> 05:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
us those of you who follow me on social
 
05:56:45.708 --> 05:56:45.718 align:start position:0%
media will notice that I sometimes
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
change my profile picture to a picture
 
05:56:49.110 --> 05:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:56:51.910 --> 05:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
ribbon this means yet another friend
 
05:56:54.190 --> 05:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't bear the pain of another
 
05:56:56.708 --> 05:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
day the episodic nature the
 
05:56:59.030 --> 05:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
unpredictability the unbearable pain and
 
05:57:01.310 --> 05:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
the impact on every single aspect of
 
05:57:03.708 --> 05:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
your life makes you feel desperate to
 
05:57:06.390 --> 05:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
find an end to your suffering
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
when I was finally diagnosed I attended
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
an event and finally met someone who
 
05:57:12.750 --> 05:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
suffered from my condition who got it
 
05:57:15.350 --> 05:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
who understood me that day opened me up
 
05:57:17.390 --> 05:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
to support and a family from all over
 
05:57:19.948 --> 05:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
the world I'm sharing this with all of
 
05:57:22.910 --> 05:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
you because that day I was given hope
 
05:57:25.708 --> 05:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
that day I was educated about silos
 
05:57:28.270 --> 05:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
cybin It is believed to help people like
 
05:57:30.868 --> 05:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
me by potentially interrupting and
 
05:57:33.510 --> 05:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
preventing headache Cycles it is thought
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
to reduce inflammation in the brain all
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
alter pain perception and reset the
 
05:57:40.788 --> 05:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
neural Pathways that interrupts these
 
05:57:40.798 --> 05:57:41.948 align:start position:0%
neural Pathways that interrupts these
painful

05:57:41.948 --> 05:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
painful
 
05:57:46.390 --> 05:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
Cycles very occasional use of small non
 
05:57:49.948 --> 05:57:49.958 align:start position:0%
hucog enic micro does and at times even
 
05:57:52.628 --> 05:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
a single dose has been known to increase
 
05:57:55.510 --> 05:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
remission periods or even stop a cycle
 
05:57:57.468 --> 05:57:57.478 align:start position:0%
completely in his
 
05:58:00.310 --> 05:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
tracks as little as a single dose has
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
the power to allow someone relief when
 
05:58:04.830 --> 05:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any for years or even
 
05:58:04.840 --> 05:58:06.670 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been any for years or even
decades

05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
decades
 
05:58:08.510 --> 05:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
it has the power to give someone back
 
05:58:10.110 --> 05:58:10.120 align:start position:0%
their ability to be present for their
 
05:58:12.310 --> 05:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
family to give someone back their
 
05:58:14.830 --> 05:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
dignity and most of all making silus
 
05:58:17.150 --> 05:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
ibin available to someone like me has
 
05:58:19.868 --> 05:58:19.878 align:start position:0%
the power to save lives I'm asking for
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
you to consider passing HB
 
05:58:25.548 --> 05:58:25.558 align:start position:0%
528 um at least make an effort to try
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
some form of making it work because
 
05:58:29.230 --> 05:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
people like me shouldn't have to make a
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
choice between living our lives and
 
05:58:33.110 --> 05:58:33.120 align:start position:0%
breaking the law thank you all for
 
05:58:34.548 --> 05:58:34.558 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to share this
 
05:58:38.110 --> 05:58:38.120 align:start position:0%
with you um um I
 
05:58:41.270 --> 05:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
had um somebody from my family from my
 
05:58:42.628 --> 05:58:42.638 align:start position:0%
cluster family was going to come here
 
05:58:45.350 --> 05:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
today and testify but um they were
 
05:58:48.868 --> 05:58:48.878 align:start position:0%
coming from Chicago and New Jersey and
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
opted not to so I have um I have a
 
05:58:55.788 --> 05:58:55.798 align:start position:0%
testimony for you and I also have some
 
05:58:57.830 --> 05:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
some additional information about
 
05:59:01.350 --> 05:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:04.190 --> 05:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
that sorry thank you
 
05:59:07.510 --> 05:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative Representative no
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:14.548 --> 05:59:14.558 align:start position:0%
gone I don't think she W representative
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:23.590 --> 05:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
05:59:28.628 --> 05:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah just that was a
 
05:59:32.830 --> 05:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
very intense for you to do and for us to
 
05:59:35.548 --> 05:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
hear wasn't easy and I was just curious
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
with since it's so successful you I just
 
05:59:39.510 --> 05:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
curious how
 
05:59:43.350 --> 05:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
long um the remissions might be and has
 
05:59:46.510 --> 05:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
has how how well it has affected your
 
05:59:48.350 --> 05:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
ability to do things just because you
 
05:59:50.430 --> 05:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
take that thank
 
05:59:54.990 --> 05:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
you um so there are a lot there there
 
05:59:57.510 --> 05:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
are some people that just sort of use it
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
medically on a scheduled basis um but
 
06:00:02.868 --> 06:00:02.878 align:start position:0%
for others uh one
 
06:00:06.708 --> 06:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
dose um one dose
 
06:00:09.708 --> 06:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
causes months and months of remission um
 
06:00:11.150 --> 06:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
there's actually people that I know that
 
06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
have been used it one time um they've
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:24.628 --> 06:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:32.670 --> 06:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
Olsen I have a similar story um I don't
 
06:00:38.830 --> 06:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know that my condition is a a
 
06:00:41.230 --> 06:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
cluster headache issue I I believe it
 
06:00:46.190 --> 06:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
was um caused by exposure to an a common
 
06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
food additive um so it's it's a little
 
06:00:52.510 --> 06:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
bit different but a very similar sort of
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
feeling it would
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
um uh create a a blinding overwhelming
 
06:01:02.430 --> 06:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
pain that essentially made me not
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
functional for 12 hours at a
 
06:01:07.030 --> 06:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
time um
 
06:01:10.430 --> 06:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
this happened frequently enough where it
 
06:01:12.628 --> 06:01:12.638 align:start position:0%
would would have essentially prevented
 
06:01:15.628 --> 06:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
me from being a functional human being I
 
06:01:18.670 --> 06:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to imagine how someone
 
06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh experiencing that could maintain a
 
06:01:23.510 --> 06:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
job or take care of their home or
 
06:01:27.510 --> 06:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
anything like that
 
06:01:32.750 --> 06:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I went through uh number of uh
 
06:01:34.708 --> 06:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
attempts to figure this out and and to
 
06:01:36.510 --> 06:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
deal with it I
 
06:01:39.350 --> 06:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh I had an MRI at Mayo and was
 
06:01:43.628 --> 06:01:43.638 align:start position:0%
prescribed rise of triptan which does
 
06:01:47.270 --> 06:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
almost nothing um later I was given T it
 
06:01:50.030 --> 06:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
all by a a local Clinic which also does
 
06:01:52.708 --> 06:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
almost nothing these are expensive
 
06:01:54.628 --> 06:01:54.638 align:start position:0%
medications um that they give you very
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
little of in a prescription and uh you
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
essentially would have to carry it with
 
06:02:00.670 --> 06:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
you all the time because you don't know
 
06:02:03.628 --> 06:02:03.638 align:start position:0%
when it's going to happen and they do
 
06:02:03.638 --> 06:02:04.708 align:start position:0%
when it's going to happen and they do
almost

06:02:04.708 --> 06:02:04.718 align:start position:0%
almost
 
06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
nothing um I think it's important to
 
06:02:09.548 --> 06:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
point out the uh the nature of the
 
06:02:11.990 --> 06:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
randomness as well the initial symptom
 
06:02:15.868 --> 06:02:15.878 align:start position:0%
of this migraine is uh that things
 
06:02:18.750 --> 06:02:18.760 align:start position:0%
disappear in your field of vision um I
 
06:02:20.868 --> 06:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
don't know if if anyone has experienced
 
06:02:24.990 --> 06:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
seeing your blind spots um you can uh
 
06:02:26.910 --> 06:02:26.920 align:start position:0%
there's little uh optical illusions you
 
06:02:28.750 --> 06:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
can look up online that'll let you
 
06:02:31.390 --> 06:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
experience this if you haven't but
 
06:02:33.270 --> 06:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's as if something
 
06:02:35.270 --> 06:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that normally would be right in your
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
field of vision like say one of you uh
 
06:02:40.310 --> 06:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
was just photoshopped out of the
 
06:02:44.548 --> 06:02:44.558 align:start position:0%
picture um so that being the the initial
 
06:02:47.948 --> 06:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
symptom um is a pretty dangerous thing
 
06:02:50.430 --> 06:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
um if you're not immediately aware of it
 
06:02:51.788 --> 06:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
if you don't realize that there's
 
06:02:54.548 --> 06:02:54.558 align:start position:0%
something there you know in the case of
 
06:02:57.468 --> 06:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
say driving for example and once you
 
06:02:59.230 --> 06:02:59.240 align:start position:0%
notice that initial symptom if you
 
06:03:01.990 --> 06:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
notice that initial symptom uh you have
 
06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
about 10 or 15 minutes to be somewhere
 
06:03:07.230 --> 06:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
where you can be in capacitated for 12
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
hours um that's pretty problematic for
 
06:03:18.750 --> 06:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:22.190 --> 06:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
so I was aware that people had used
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
psilocybin for headaches um for
 
06:03:30.628 --> 06:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
migraines and uh being in a situation
 
06:03:34.230 --> 06:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
where essentially can't continue to to
 
06:03:37.230 --> 06:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
live without doing something about it uh
 
06:03:41.910 --> 06:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
I tried that uh thankfully I was able to
 
06:03:44.910 --> 06:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
you know safely obtain that at the time
 
06:03:46.110 --> 06:03:46.120 align:start position:0%
um which a lot of people are
 
06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not able to do um and I
 
06:03:55.270 --> 06:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
tried it and it immediately turned off
 
06:03:58.110 --> 06:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
the migraine as soon as it happened I
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
tried that a couple of times and it
 
06:04:01.628 --> 06:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
worked every
 
06:04:05.230 --> 06:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
time now I'm in the position where well
 
06:04:07.830 --> 06:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
what do I do do I for the rest of my
 
06:04:09.590 --> 06:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
life carry around
 
06:04:12.510 --> 06:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
a prohibited substance in case I get a
 
06:04:15.230 --> 06:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
migraine that's a dangerous thing to
 
06:04:15.240 --> 06:04:16.868 align:start position:0%
migraine that's a dangerous thing to
do

06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:04:19.310 --> 06:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's a it's a very awkward
 
06:04:21.468 --> 06:04:21.478 align:start position:0%
situation to put a person in now
 
06:04:24.468 --> 06:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
thankfully uh um I did come up with a
 
06:04:28.510 --> 06:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
solution for this I I took uh a small
 
06:04:31.868 --> 06:04:31.878 align:start position:0%
dose one of these micro doses uh 6 days
 
06:04:34.350 --> 06:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
a week for a year and I never had
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
another migraine again that was about 6
 
06:04:37.670 --> 06:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
06:04:41.468 --> 06:04:41.478 align:start position:0%
ago um so for me that worked I I don't
 
06:04:42.990 --> 06:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
know that that would work for anyone
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
else I was never diagnosed with a
 
06:04:47.310 --> 06:04:47.320 align:start position:0%
specific condition but I do know other
 
06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
people with uh with migraines who have
 
06:04:51.310 --> 06:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
said they've had similar experiences
 
06:04:51.320 --> 06:04:52.468 align:start position:0%
said they've had similar experiences
cancelling

06:04:52.468 --> 06:04:52.478 align:start position:0%
cancelling
 
06:04:55.590 --> 06:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
them um I think it's also worth pointing
 
06:04:58.670 --> 06:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
out that despite this being um a
 
06:05:00.830 --> 06:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited substance which undoubtedly
 
06:05:03.310 --> 06:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
makes it greatly uh more costly than it
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
would could otherwise be um a micro do
 
06:05:12.590 --> 06:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
is very small um my one-year therapy was
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
essentially you know 30 bucks um split
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
into you know 300 plus doses it's like a
 
06:05:21.868 --> 06:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
penny a dose
 
06:05:25.590 --> 06:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
um much much cheaper than any than a
 
06:05:27.030 --> 06:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
single pill of any of the other
 
06:05:29.390 --> 06:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
medication that I could have received uh
 
06:05:30.910 --> 06:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
much much cheaper than a doctor's
 
06:05:32.468 --> 06:05:32.478 align:start position:0%
appointment to get the prescription for
 
06:05:35.070 --> 06:05:35.080 align:start position:0%
any of that medication um this is an
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
extreme cheap extremely effective
 
06:05:38.240 --> 06:05:40.070 align:start position:0%
extreme cheap extremely effective
therapy

06:05:40.070 --> 06:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
therapy
 
06:05:40.080 --> 06:05:41.868 align:start position:0%
therapy
um

06:05:41.868 --> 06:05:41.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:44.430 --> 06:05:44.440 align:start position:0%
there there should be no barrier to
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
anyone being able to get this and this
 
06:05:49.868 --> 06:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
is an effective dose that is orders of
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
magnitude smaller than what someone
 
06:05:54.990 --> 06:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
would need for a recreational dose um
 
06:05:55.000 --> 06:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
would need for a recreational dose um
there

06:05:55.910 --> 06:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:05:58.590 --> 06:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
is there really isn't any risk that I
 
06:06:03.150 --> 06:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:06.110 --> 06:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
um I'll answer any questions if anybody
 
06:06:06.120 --> 06:06:11.548 align:start position:0%
um I'll answer any questions if anybody
has

06:06:11.548 --> 06:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.110 --> 06:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
any when you were when you were micro
 
06:06:15.788 --> 06:06:15.798 align:start position:0%
doing were you effectively
 
06:06:17.628 --> 06:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
self-medicating or were you doing this
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of a physician or
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
how did that work uh the Physicians
 
06:06:24.788 --> 06:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
didn't even tell me about this and I saw
 
06:06:27.110 --> 06:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
a number of them um all they wanted to
 
06:06:28.350 --> 06:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
do was
 
06:06:32.350 --> 06:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
prescribe these expensive and frankly
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
useless medications uh none of them
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned psychedelic at all uh I was
 
06:06:39.708 --> 06:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
aware of them I was aware that they were
 
06:06:42.150 --> 06:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
used for headaches and
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
um you know that's yeah no no medical
 
06:06:49.030 --> 06:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
professional did or said anything and I
 
06:06:50.430 --> 06:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
think that's a serious concern when you
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
talk about doing a medical only bill um
 
06:06:53.760 --> 06:06:54.670 align:start position:0%
talk about doing a medical only bill um
you

06:06:54.670 --> 06:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
know nobody is well nobody's really
 
06:07:00.868 --> 06:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
informing medical professionals about
 
06:07:06.990 --> 06:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
some of them are aware but they're
 
06:07:11.230 --> 06:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
they're hesitant to to talk about it
 
06:07:13.990 --> 06:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
much less prescribe it
 
06:07:18.990 --> 06:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm I would be concerned that if done
 
06:07:23.150 --> 06:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
if you know if it relied on a doctor
 
06:07:25.110 --> 06:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
prescribing it that it just wouldn't get
 
06:07:30.868 --> 06:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:30.878 --> 06:07:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
it

06:07:33.750 --> 06:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:07:36.070 --> 06:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
Newman yes thank you
 
06:07:39.510 --> 06:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
on quite a few prescription medications
 
06:07:41.510 --> 06:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be a notice on the prescription
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
label that um a cautionary um note on
 
06:07:47.590 --> 06:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
there this prescription might cause
 
06:07:50.150 --> 06:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
drowsiness and recommended not to use
 
06:07:52.830 --> 06:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
heavy equipment or to consider not
 
06:07:56.110 --> 06:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
driving for a period of time is there
 
06:07:59.670 --> 06:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
anything like that that you're aware of
 
06:08:01.948 --> 06:08:01.958 align:start position:0%
with a psychedelic
 
06:08:05.070 --> 06:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
use well I that would depend on quantity
 
06:08:07.990 --> 06:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
I mean recreational dose especially for
 
06:08:10.708 --> 06:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
a person who hasn't experienced that
 
06:08:12.868 --> 06:08:12.878 align:start position:0%
before yeah could you would not want to
 
06:08:16.830 --> 06:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
go drive around um for the dose that I
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
did for this well below the perceptive
 
06:08:22.628 --> 06:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
level there's no noticeable effect from
 
06:08:24.910 --> 06:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
it whatsoever like my
 
06:08:24.920 --> 06:08:26.670 align:start position:0%
it whatsoever like my
oneyear

06:08:26.670 --> 06:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
oneyear
 
06:08:29.150 --> 06:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know system where I took it every
 
06:08:30.868 --> 06:08:30.878 align:start position:0%
six days we're talking about a tiny tiny
 
06:08:32.350 --> 06:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
little amount that's basically one
 
06:08:34.190 --> 06:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
recreational dose taken by one person
 
06:08:36.350 --> 06:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
over an entire year
 
06:08:36.360 --> 06:08:38.670 align:start position:0%
over an entire year
um

06:08:38.670 --> 06:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:08:41.990 --> 06:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah that that would not have any
 
06:08:42.000 --> 06:08:43.310 align:start position:0%
so yeah that that would not have any
effect

06:08:43.310 --> 06:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
effect
 
06:08:47.150 --> 06:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
um and uh I mean honestly even a dose
 
06:08:48.750 --> 06:08:48.760 align:start position:0%
that did have an effect would probably
 
06:08:51.310 --> 06:08:51.320 align:start position:0%
be safer than the migraine for
 
06:08:51.320 --> 06:08:53.190 align:start position:0%
be safer than the migraine for
driving

06:08:53.190 --> 06:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
driving
 
06:08:56.230 --> 06:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
um not that I would recommend that but
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
you know that's you can't do anything
 
06:09:00.390 --> 06:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
when you're having the
 
06:09:03.150 --> 06:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
migraine you know and the other thing is
 
06:09:05.948 --> 06:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:09:08.750 --> 06:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
you you know if you take something that
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
could cause a side effect you know what
 
06:09:13.788 --> 06:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
that side effect is going to be
 
06:09:16.628 --> 06:09:16.638 align:start position:0%
um if it just happens to you randomly
 
06:09:18.390 --> 06:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
you really don't know what to expect or
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
when it's going to kick in um and that
 
06:09:22.708 --> 06:09:22.718 align:start position:0%
that in itself is pretty
 
06:09:24.990 --> 06:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
dangerous um you just don't know what
 
06:09:27.070 --> 06:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
situation you're going to be in if if
 
06:09:29.110 --> 06:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
something can randomly happen to you
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
that causes you to not be functional or
 
06:09:33.948 --> 06:09:33.958 align:start position:0%
to not be able to see things that are
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
potentially important in your field of
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
you um how do you prepare for that you
 
06:09:40.270 --> 06:09:40.280 align:start position:0%
basically would just have to think about
 
06:09:47.750 --> 06:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:50.110 --> 06:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
time see no further questions thank you
 
06:09:53.910 --> 06:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:56.510 --> 06:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
thanks is there anybody else here that
 
06:09:59.030 --> 06:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on House Bill 528 that
 
06:10:01.750 --> 06:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
is not turned in a paint card saying
 
06:10:03.750 --> 06:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
none I will close the public
 
06:10:06.868 --> 06:10:06.878 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
06:10:09.150 --> 06:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
