second
 
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative Dumas would
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
you care to speak to motion sir
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah this this bill is uh
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
kind of conflicts with a bill that we
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
already retained it would be uh probably
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
prudent to kind of work on them together
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we keep the laws
 
00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:16.970 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we keep the laws
consistent

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
um that one being in question and being
 
00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:27.419 align:start position:0%
worked on this would just add another
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing to that list so even though I
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
support this in theory that's just me
 
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with the routine it with
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
the enthusiasm is Awesome seconded by
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative Jones
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
um representative Sykes would you care
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
to speak to emotion I would Mr chairman
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:09.409 --> 00:27:09.419 align:start position:0%
um this Bill had a long
 
00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
list of supporters and Technical data
 
00:27:15.049 --> 00:27:15.059 align:start position:0%
that made this be the right thing to do
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
for example
 
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:17.870 align:start position:0%
for example
um

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:19.700 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
talked about how the American Academy of
 
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:25.580 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics the CDC they both recommend
 
00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:29.299 align:start position:0%
uh rear-facing car seats for infants
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
data on this issue is fully in support
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
of rear-facing car seats and TSB also
 
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:39.140 align:start position:0%
does research on car seats for children
 
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
interestingly Dartmouth Health can
 
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
actually provide car seats for families
 
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
that are needy so it's there's not a
 
00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:47.700 align:start position:0%
huge expense for those people who can't
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
afford them
 
00:27:52.909 --> 00:27:52.919 align:start position:0%
um uh Dan Goodman from the AAA testified
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill almost all
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
independent studies corroborate that
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
rear-facing car seats are better for the
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
survivability of the occupants
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
and he made note of the fact that it's
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
education engineering and finally
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement that helps create a safe
 
00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:11.900 align:start position:0%
environment for people who are
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
amongst the most vulnerable members of
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
our motoring public and for that reason
 
00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
I fully support OTP
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
thank you sir thank you anybody else
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
really oh representative sakes I mean uh
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
sellers sorry yeah thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to probably vote against this
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
bill because you know
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's just another burden on the parents
 
00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.220 align:start position:0%
which I think are very responsible to
 
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:43.380 align:start position:0%
start out with and caring for the young
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
children at this point
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
and also I think it's this is designed
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
to only a specific group of people and
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
not all people because not everybody has
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
a child under two years old and
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
therefore we're creating a law just for
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
a specific group of people and it should
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
wow okay I'll I will add my two cents in
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
because I did vote for this bill last
 
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.649 align:start position:0%
because I did vote for this bill last
term

00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
um since then I've had my my most
 
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940 align:start position:0%
important constituent my mother tell me
 
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
that I was crazy and she never would
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
have done that to me because it's cruel
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to vote against the ought
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
to pass this time uh for another couple
 
00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
of reasons I
 
00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:32.039 align:start position:0%
while I agree that it's a common sense
 
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
measure and we heard from AAA that even
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
the hospitals won't usually let kids out
 
00:29:39.529 --> 00:29:39.539 align:start position:0%
of the hospital until they are in a
 
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
rear-facing child seat so it sounds to
 
00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
me like the parents are getting the
 
00:29:42.539 --> 00:29:43.510 align:start position:0%
me like the parents are getting the
information

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
my other problem is with enforceability
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen any two-year-olds go
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
around with IDs saying they're two so I
 
00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
don't really know what this has
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
accomplished what this accomplishes uh
 
00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
so with that I will be voting against
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass anybody else from the
 
00:29:58.799 --> 00:30:00.370 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass anybody else from the
committee

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:00.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
um this bill came up two years ago we
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
had a very memorable
 
00:30:08.149 --> 00:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
extremely long floor debate on it and
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
the upshot of it this time that time the
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
virtually identical Bill originated the
 
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
house and the upshot of it was that this
 
00:30:16.669 --> 00:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
became a study the Senate turned a study
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee in the study committee of
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
course recommended uh in favor one I
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
think is a pretty Common Sense law if
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
you know to restraint backwards but we
 
00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
did have
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
um those of us who were here two years
 
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
ago did have what's either
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
which either amusing or painful but like

um those of you that were here you may
 
00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
remember we saw this basic same bill
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
last term
 
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh we uh actually I believe retained it
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
in the first year interim studied it the
 
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
second year uh and every time we tried
 
00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:28.379 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem came up with another
 
00:34:28.379 --> 00:34:29.329 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem came up with another
question

00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:30.770 align:start position:0%
question
the

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
the onus of what we kept discussing was
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
how to get these agricultural workers
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
with an h2a Visa a New Hampshire
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
driver's license because as we heard the
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
farmers the Apple farmers in particular
 
00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:44.339 align:start position:0%
are now getting fined by the United
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
States Department of Labor for not
 
00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
complying with New Hampshire law which
 
00:34:49.609 --> 00:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
requires they get their driver's license
 
00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
I started looking at this a little
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
different I have to tell you we put a
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
and we decided to look at it differently
 
00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.550 align:start position:0%
and we decided to look at it differently
knowing

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
again excuse me that anybody from
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
Jamaica for example that's some of the
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
ones we're talking about if they came to
 
00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
the United States on vacation they could
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
drive on the roads of the State of New
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with their
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
Jamaican driver's license currently and
 
00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
so I in in an effort to solve this
 
00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:23.109 align:start position:0%
so I in in an effort to solve this
problem

00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
we decided to go with that that they can
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
already drive with their license on the
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
states the roads of the state and just
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
extend it from the 60 days to 300 days
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
which is what it's prescribed on line 17
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
and 18 of the amendment the rest of the
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill stays the same again if you read
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
it just replaces section let's do this
 
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
replaces after section one the amendment
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
and then the original section two will
 
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
read a section three which is the
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
effective date so that's what it does in
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
other words in summary for h2a
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
agricultural workers they can drive with
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
their out-of-country license while
 
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
they're here working for 300 days if
 
00:36:10.609 --> 00:36:10.619 align:start position:0%
they're if they overstay that then
 
00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:12.859 align:start position:0%
everything else did some current statute
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
kicks in so that's all the amendment
 
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:16.430 align:start position:0%
kicks in so that's all the amendment
does

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I wondered if the
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of the amendment would be
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
able to find out for me how an officer
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
gets to know when 300 days is up when
 
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
they are stopping someone on the side of
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
the road
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
oh defer maybe I see people from the
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety here maybe they can
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
answer that question because the same
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
question applies to how does an officer
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
know when somebody's 60 days is up
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
um anybody from the direction Department
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles want to chime in on
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to throw you on the spot
 
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:13.130 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to throw you on the spot
but

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
John marasco director of division of
 
00:37:17.089 --> 00:37:17.099 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
um just speaking with Captain Vetter in
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
the back this is this is one of those
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
areas where it is a gray area
 
00:37:26.089 --> 00:37:26.099 align:start position:0%
um there's no way to truly tell that
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
um information unless you have
 
00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
information that comes to you for
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
example if somebody were to move here
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
from another state and they've got the
 
00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:34.859 align:start position:0%
out-of-state license plate on their
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
vehicle and it stays on the vehicle for
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
a prolonged period of time you may have
 
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
somebody that calls the police or
 
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:44.339 align:start position:0%
highlights that to the town clerk to let
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
them know that this played Sierra but
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
the person's been living here for
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
greater than 60 days it would have to be
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
some type of mechanism that comes in at
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
roadside you're not going to be able to
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
ascertain that because you're not going
 
00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:58.140 align:start position:0%
to be able to ask for uh you know a
 
00:37:59.630 --> 00:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
never Source bill or anything of that
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
nature with a date on it so that's why
 
00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
to your point Mr chair the uh that
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
60-day window that 50 59 days if you
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
will driving on the Home Country license
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
which is the gray area and your
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
rationale for what what the committee is
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
taking uh before it today
 
00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:16.490 align:start position:0%
taking uh before it today
um

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's easily
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
enforced so
 
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for that do you think with the
 
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
h2a VISA holders it would be easier to
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
ascertain especially with investigation
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
because they actually have documents and
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
dates saying when they applied for the
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
Visa I don't know if it says when they
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
actually got on a plane but do you think
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
it could be easier for them versus just
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
somebody moving here from out of state
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
I think the paperwork is a great place
 
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
to start yes my understanding is on that
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
Visa it's good for three years so you
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
could you could certainly look at
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
um when that went into effect and then
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
try to calculate it from there as to how
 
00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
long they've been in the state
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
not to again not to put you on the spot
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned three years when I
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
looked it up I saw one year with two
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
extensions is that the same or is that
 
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.890 align:start position:0%
extensions is that the same or is that
actually

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
treating it annual on an annual basis
 
00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's a good question I I
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
don't know I was told that it was uh
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
from supervisors at the DMV it was a
 
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:17.300 align:start position:0%
three-year maximum three-year
 
00:39:19.849 --> 00:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
Visa but I'd have to look into okay well
 
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
I looked at it yesterday it is
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
year by year one year with two
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
extensions so thank you very much so
 
00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
that that would give you a better
 
00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
timetable then right looking at that
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
document did that answer your question
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
representative Hill
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think it does I think I heard that
 
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.430 align:start position:0%
I think it does I think I heard that
um

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
that we wouldn't know when at the
 
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:42.380 align:start position:0%
roadside we wouldn't know when it was
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
299 days or
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
360 days is that accurate
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be depending
 
00:39:52.079 --> 00:39:52.790 align:start position:0%
I think it's going to be depending
um

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
depending on when when the person came
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
in you could look at the paperwork but
 
00:39:59.810 --> 00:39:59.820 align:start position:0%
um you know if they if they went back to
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
in this case Jamaica and then came back
 
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.750 align:start position:0%
in this case Jamaica and then came back
again

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
um you're not going to necessarily know
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
that no but it's I guess it's very
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
similar to what we're doing now with the
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
59-day window until the 60th day
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
um it's very difficult to ascertain
 
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
exactly how long somebody's been in the
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
state and if they've reached that 60-day
 
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
Mark and again cap I know uh with uh
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
with highway safety is there anything
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm missing here okay
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
so it is it is a gray area it's
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
basically a conversation at roadside
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
that would help you develop how long the
 
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
person's been in the state you're hoping
 
00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be somewhat honest
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
with you on that and if they're not then
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to have to come in
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
through a third party or observation of
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
something else like a plate or paperwork
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
that you can use to triangulate how long
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.930 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
would you want to follow up
 
00:40:53.579 --> 00:40:54.829 align:start position:0%
would you want to follow up
I

00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
I do but I I will Reserve thanks thank
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
you very much director thank you anybody
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
see none I'll call the question on the
 
00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:07.450 align:start position:0%
see none I'll call the question on the
amendment

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:07.460 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
so we won't bother with the roll call I
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
don't believe I'll start with a Voice
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
vote so the motion is
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
um to adopt amendment number two zero
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
two three dash one eight two three h all
 
00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
those in favor say aye
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
aye opposed nay
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
okay so the amendment is adopted Now we
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
move on to ought to pass as amended
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 187 any further
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none the amendment pretty much
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
does it
 
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:43.020 align:start position:0%

chairman um
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
when I read this bill and when I heard
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
testimony the way I look at this bill
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
it's almost like legislation to be
 
00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
it's almost like legislation to be
anti-fun

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
anti-fun
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
and to me to require all this
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
certification is just not something that
 
00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
I'm too keen on so I'm going to be
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%

representative bayu
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as kind of helping to
 
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
alleviate some of the conflict with
 
00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:49.940 align:start position:0%
landowners that
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
helps preserve some of the trails that
 
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
we have from being closed off because
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
people aren't respecting the property so
 
00:52:57.359 --> 00:52:58.490 align:start position:0%
people aren't respecting the property so
this

00:52:58.490 --> 00:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
kind of to me is kind of the opposite of
 
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:01.790 align:start position:0%
kind of to me is kind of the opposite of
of

00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:03.650 align:start position:0%
of
uh

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
it's it's helping to preserve fun in
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
that way so
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%

my concern with the bill is is I think
 
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:17.579 align:start position:0%
we discussed was
 
00:53:20.809 --> 00:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
it uh it has start dates and you know if
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
you're 46 years or 45 years old you have
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
to have a a course or if you're 36 and
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
26 and I I would think that the stock
 
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
date would be a lot better if it was
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
like this would be started as of today
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
or or January 1st 2024 so for everyone
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
at that point so no one that if you're
 
00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
25 you don't have to have a license or
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
27 you do and you know so at this point
 
00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
here it's saying you know hey I've
 
00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
already been used in recreation vehicles
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
for X number of years and now I have to
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
go and get a take a course and have a
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
license so
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
I think there's just a lot of confusing
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
in this bill and I think a start date
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
should be instead of these different
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
dates of starting and how old you are so
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's a problem with it and I'm
 
00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:10.380 align:start position:0%
not going to be supporting the ought to
 
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
not going to be supporting the ought to
pass

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
 
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.170 align:start position:0%
thank you sir anybody else from the
committee

00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
I might agree with all that if you
 
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:24.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't drive them on the roads which
 
00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:26.339 align:start position:0%
you can there are towns that have opened
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
up their roads to them and state
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
highways up north
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
to we did this a few years ago and found
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
that some of these ohrvs are larger
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
faster and more powerful than some
 
00:54:40.859 --> 00:54:42.230 align:start position:0%
faster and more powerful than some
streetcars

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
streetcars
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
they're running on the roads on tires
 
00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:47.160 align:start position:0%
that say not for on-road use or not for
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
Highway use
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
letting somebody know all of that and
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
not assuming that it's safe to go I
 
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
don't know that that just makes sense to
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
me if they were just operating on the
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
trails I'd probably feel differently
 
00:54:59.630 --> 00:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
about it but that's not those current
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah and I'll just add I have gone back
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
and forth on this one there are good
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
points on both sides
 
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:16.619 align:start position:0%
so in an unusual move
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what I'm going to do but
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to figure it out real soon
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
with nothing else
 
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.150 align:start position:0%
with nothing else
um

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
you've been asked the clerk to call the
 
00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:29.460 align:start position:0%
roll and she's ready the motion is ought
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:55.870 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%

for one issue because I remember when I
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
was told after using a boat for 25 years
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
goodness fifteen to five
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
motion about to pass as amended is
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
adopted 15 to 5. this will go on regular
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
calendar I'll close the executive
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 256.
 
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.290 align:start position:0%
session on Senate bill 256.
okay

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:14.300 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:16.970 --> 00:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
last day let me get organized for a
 
00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
minute but I'd like to get our
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to defend these
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
on the floor I get that list already and
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
the other thing I want to go over is
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
where the committee feels on the on the
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
bills that the Senate has amended so we
 
00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:33.059 align:start position:0%
can get those taken care of concurred
 
00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:35.780 align:start position:0%
and unconcurred I would suspect Thursday
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
and finally I do have lists if you
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
forget but at the last time we were here
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to start putting together our
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittees on the retained bills I
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
did get an email from you representative
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
sellers on which ones you were
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
volunteering for but we'll talk about
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
minutes don't all run off yet we'll get
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%

well nothing's on the calendar yet oh I
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%

01:04:02.819 --> 01:04:06.190 align:start position:0%
mean it's in terms of extended
amendments

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%

01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
so I can go over these in a minute I
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
just want to confirm that we only have
 
01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:39.589 align:start position:0%

01:05:53.809 --> 01:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:13.260 align:start position:0%
thinking about with the camp counselors
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
no is it yeah 111 the only thing they
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
did was change it from uh three Senators
 
01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
to one as you all know I did not vote
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
for this bill in committee I missed the
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
floor vote but in all fairness I'm only
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
going to talk to the Senate Amendment
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
which makes the change I have no problem
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
with the concur what's the opinion of
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.829 align:start position:0%

speech on the floor I don't see any harm
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%

watched the public hearing I thought
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
they were going to be making a change
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
about the color of the executive Council
 
01:07:57.890 --> 01:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
plates but it's not here so the only
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
thing is the addition of the Senate
 
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:06.230 align:start position:0%

retained bills
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%

tint window tint bills which I think we
 
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
can do with one study committee
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%

01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:42.299 align:start position:0%
will be getting on that
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
