00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
so so for today I just kind of wanted to
 
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
go through so on our orientation day uh
 
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
back when we had the full committee
 
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
orientation the morning we met here in
 
00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
the afternoon we we didn't really get
 
00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
into a whole lot of detail of process
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
for division two so I kind of wanted to
 
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
just go through
 
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
the next six weeks process and I know I
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest this was somewhat focused
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
for our two new members and they're not
 
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
here so some of this might be refresher
 
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
for for for those returning which is all
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
of you but also for division two we have
 
00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
a couple new members so just Mr chair
 
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's ultimately up to you how we proceed
 
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
but I'll
 
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
yeah so one question that came up
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
earlier was our deadline so we're
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
looking ahead and working back the last
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
day that we our office really needs for
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
division decisions to be made on House
 
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
Bill one and two is March 23rd and that
 
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
would give us enough time to turn it
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
around your package to present to the
 
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
full committee that following Monday so
 
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
March 23rd is a Thursday that following
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
Monday is when division two would
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
present its budget proposal to the full
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
committee so working backwards from then
 
00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
you're talking a month and a week is
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
about what we have which will go quick
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh February is a short month
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah but starting now you do have the
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget uh in
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
there you got the uh executive summary
 
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
the capital budget which we don't really
 
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
have to concern ourselves with uh you
 
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday's budget address you
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
heard this morning you had an hour close
 
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
to two hours with the governor's office
 
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.110 align:start position:0%
to two hours with the governor's office
uh

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
did you want me to point out anything
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
specific in this like like I said we've
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
got all of our familiar members here so
 
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
this document should look like something
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
you've seen before as far as fiscal 22
 
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
actuals fiscal 23 adjusted authorized 24
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
25 proposed there's positions in this
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
document for each accounting unit how
 
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
many authorized positions there are so
 
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:29.340 align:start position:0%
this tier this big book I would
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
recommend you keep it in this room so as
 
00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:34.979 align:start position:0%
the agencies start coming in tomorrow
 
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
this will be the working document that
 
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
we're we're using so when they come in
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
to present their budget if you want to
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
go through their entire department
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
they'll have a presentation handout I'm
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
sure but this is really the official
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
working document that we're making
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
when I say keep it here as long as you
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
have this with you on the days we're
 
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
working on that agency however you do
 
00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:28.139 align:start position:0%
that you don't have to keep the big
 
00:08:30.529 --> 00:08:30.539 align:start position:0%
books together you know here all the
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
time but when we get to so for instance
 
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:34.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
um ccsnh and usnh are coming in to
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
present their Governor's recommended
 
00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
budget uh they have one line in here so
 
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're easy and then in the afternoon
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
Lottery and police standards are coming
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
in so these are you know the accounting
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
units they'll be working from when
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
they're talking about the governor's
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommended budget so this is the
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
the working document if you will
 
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.250 align:start position:0%
the working document if you will
um

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
it should be right on the very front
 
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.730 align:start position:0%
it should be right on the very front
page

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
the very first page of your binder
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
should have an index hopefully
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
alphabetized by agency with the page
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:25.970 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
yep so they're they're around like page
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
1209 and 1212 if I remember correctly
 
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so when they come in tomorrow they
 
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:34.620 align:start position:0%
don't have many accounting units
 
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
compared to doe dot safety so those
 
00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
should be easier budgets which is kind
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
of the idea for why we're scheduling
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
them first hopefully there won't be much
 
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:46.980 align:start position:0%
work for those but you'll hear from them
 
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
work for those but you'll hear from them
tomorrow

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
mic up here some of the smaller budgets
 
00:09:56.329 --> 00:09:56.339 align:start position:0%
they're not they're not probably not
 
00:09:57.769 --> 00:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
going to come back
 
00:09:59.630 --> 00:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
so this is kind of it
 
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
right and then we can vote them somewhat
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
sometime later but we're not going to
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
have standards in twice
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
so so so real quickly uh
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
so ccsnh usnh Lottery police standards
 
00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:18.779 align:start position:0%
tomorrow next Tuesday dot the following
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday doe and that following Wednesday
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
safety and fishing game so by March 1st
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
you'll have had all of our agencies in
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
at least once
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh some of them you won't have to have
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
back the one problem is we don't have
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and probably won't during
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
most of those presentations so we may
 
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740 align:start position:0%
have to invite some folks back for House
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 related for cleanup for cleanup
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah education for instance I just feel
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
like that's definitely going to take up
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on the back end of our
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
schedule uh
 
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
but as we're going so say even tomorrow
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
if police standards come in comes in
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
with oh you know we notice this budget
 
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
error and we need to make a correction
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
we ask the committee to you could vote
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
on that tomorrow you know you could make
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
that recommendation everything this
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
division does is simply a recommendation
 
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579 align:start position:0%
for the full committee's official vote
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
so as you're going along you can make
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
motions you can do it based off of the
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
document provided by the agency it can
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
be uh you know just as long as the
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
motion is clear you know uh you know
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
reduce a class line by X dollars Mickey
 
00:11:20.449 --> 00:11:20.459 align:start position:0%
do you got that yeah I got that and I'm
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
gonna track everything and that's why I
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
handed these documents we'll go over
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
here shortly and I'll keep a running tab
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
of all of our tentative decisions
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the the next six weeks until
 
00:11:32.569 --> 00:11:32.579 align:start position:0%
we get to March 23rd when you'll make a
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
final overall vote based on the
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
everything I've compiled for you and
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
then we'll take it across the the hall
 
00:11:59.090 --> 00:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
they're going to come in and present
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
their Governor's recommended budget we
 
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
haven't heard from either of those two
 
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:04.980 align:start position:0%
agencies at all yet so they'll tell you
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
a little about about what they do
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
lottery for instance doesn't have any
 
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
general funds you know they're they're
 
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:11.820 align:start position:0%
self-funded their net profits go to the
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
education trust fund their budget's
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
usually pretty easy unless they have any
 
00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections they need to make
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing police standards is
 
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
generally funded
 
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and they'll talk to you about what
 
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:23.220 align:start position:0%
what they're planning to do for the next
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
two years if if there's no changes that
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
their agencies looking to make and you
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
feel well that's a we don't have to do
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
anything more of them you can
 
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
tentatively accept their budget or you
 
00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660 align:start position:0%
can wait and we can do it later it's not
 
00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know so that you may not be ready to
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
make a final decision because we don't
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
know things like revenues yeah you know
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
police standards is budgets probably not
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
going to decide a whole lot of this
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
division's overall work you know they're
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
I think it's like a five and a half
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar budget
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
um considering we're going to be in the
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
billions when we're talking about the
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
education trust fund in total so some of
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
those smaller agencies you probably
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
could be okay with
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
um if if nothing jumps out to to you as
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
as things you want to look further into
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
but then again House Bill 2 police
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
standards may have something in House
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bill too a new program so we might need
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
to invite them back later
 
00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:21.470 align:start position:0%
to invite them back later
yep

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.870 align:start position:0%
okay
but

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579 align:start position:0%
Mickey when do you know when we're gonna
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
start getting revenues when we will know
 
00:13:29.569 --> 00:13:29.579 align:start position:0%
how much money
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
the hope is so house Ways and Means is
 
00:13:34.009 --> 00:13:34.019 align:start position:0%
working on that now the hope is by
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
around the beginning of March that first
 
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:37.380 align:start position:0%
week of March they'll have a resolution
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
ready to go and we can our office can
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
build that into the governor's
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
recommended budget so update his Revenue
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
estimates with Ways and Means revenues
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
and see where we are big picture and
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
then you'll know how much you have
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
either to spend or not spend or
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
depending on what those revenues are as
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
they differ from the governors so
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
hopefully I think we are planning on
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
March 1st as our tentative date our
 
00:13:59.810 --> 00:13:59.820 align:start position:0%
hopeful date
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
it's so just to make sure I understand
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
this correctly
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
you know for now we're gonna operate
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
based on the Assumption of the revenue
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
that we have in the governor's budget
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll wait for the you know
 
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
appropriate guidance from the ways and
 
00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
its means once we get it and that may
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
drive us to re-examine some of the
 
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.949 align:start position:0%
drive us to re-examine some of the
earlier

00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
temporary decisions we made but we may
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
very well not need to so we are
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
retaining the flexibility dealing with
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
as much as we can ahead of time
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you
 
00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.009 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it thank you
so

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
I I've handed out a little packet for
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
everybody just to kind of show you the
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
example of the working documents that
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try to keep everyone up
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
with for the next several weeks so these
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
are essentially our starting point so
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
the first uh spreadsheet would would
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
capture everything I could call this
 
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
like our whole universe like anything
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
that's brought to this committee's
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
attention from the agencies that they
 
00:14:53.329 --> 00:14:53.339 align:start position:0%
would like you to consider uh as well as
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
all the bills that we've got so if you
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
look down on the bottom you can see the
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
five bills that we've already retained
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
to this point and then yesterday nine
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
new bills were referred to finance so
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
I've tried to track those just so we
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
don't let anything slip through the
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
cracks really that upper section you see
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
I've kind of got some place holders for
 
00:15:14.449 --> 00:15:14.459 align:start position:0%
safety fishing and transportation
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
education as the agencies start coming
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
in and we hear their new requests I'll
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
add those on here so you'll we'll have a
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
sheet to remember everything that the
 
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:24.660 align:start position:0%
agencies are looking to have you
 
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.269 align:start position:0%
agencies are looking to have you
consider

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter yeah so the the top is
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
really like budget changes the agencies
 
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
are asking for and you see it's blank
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
now because we haven't heard from them
 
00:15:41.449 --> 00:15:41.459 align:start position:0%
yet and then the next section down is
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
just bills that we do know of that are
 
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
in this committee
 
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.730 align:start position:0%
in this committee
foreign

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
that first subset down below under
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
retained most of them are the school
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
building Aid
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yeah you may have a hole punch
 
00:15:58.129 --> 00:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
through retained I'm sorry so yeah that
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
first subset is the retain bills that
 
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've already voted on and then the
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
pending is the new ones that will have
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh educate yeah and Mickey
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
um these are pretty much all came out of
 
00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.610 align:start position:0%
um these are pretty much all came out of
Education

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
um but why are they general fund as a
 
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.610 align:start position:0%
um but why are they general fund as a
post-education

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
post-education
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
just fun so under current law the
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
education trust fund only pays for
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
adequacy Charter Schools uh efas School
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
building Aid tuition Transportation a
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
special education Aid these costs are
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
not relative to those programs it's
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
certainly in you know this committee
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
could open the education trust fund
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
usage to pay for other things but I have
 
00:16:39.889 --> 00:16:39.899 align:start position:0%
them defaulted to education or a general
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
fund for now
 
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.949 align:start position:0%
fund for now
put

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:49.019 align:start position:0%
sorry building Aid is uh education trust
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
fund currently yes
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
you can you can add more education trust
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
and the governor did add I believe 75
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
million dollars already so the budget
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
you had before you already has an
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh I mean it could be it could be 75
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
total and this is where getting House
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 will be helpful I know we have a
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
line item for building Aid in the budget
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
I haven't analyzed that fully yet but I
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
think 75 it could be 75 total including
 
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.049 align:start position:0%
think 75 it could be 75 total including
tail

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
tail
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah no that could be yeah so 75 total
 
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
but that is education trust fund
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
uh yeah plus or minus
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
just to clarify
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
um if we decide to switch the hygiene
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
product in schools from general fund to
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
education trust fund that would require
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
an hb2 section
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
or not it would so RSA 198 39 I think it
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
is explicitly States the uses of the
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund if the committee
 
00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to explore adding more programs
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
to that or uses we would have to amend
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that in hospital too to make it
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
permissible but certainly that's within
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee but
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
without an hp2 amendment this would have
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
to be general fund right now yeah I mean
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
we could yeah to to do it properly you'd
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
let me ask a macro question as we look
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
at this and we this gets totaled up I
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
mean we're not going to do all these but
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
just just for conversation
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom here it's 148 million
 
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:39.890 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom here it's 148 million
dollars

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:18:42.529 --> 00:18:42.539 align:start position:0%
do we have to in order to approve these
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
do we have to debit 148 million dollars
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and I will tell you
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
that these were essentially fiscal note
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
um uh no I'm I'm not questioning the
 
00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
dollars yeah well how do we balance it
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
in a macro so there's there's two ways
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
to look at that one and the governor had
 
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
presented that both the general fund and
 
00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund still have
 
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
remaining balances left over even after
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
his proposals so you could just
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it would just reduce the
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
amount that's left over at the end of
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
the biennium or uh yeah you you would do
 
00:19:18.409 --> 00:19:18.419 align:start position:0%
offsets so you would do a reduction
 
00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere add this so it's a net zero
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's up to the committee
 
00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:24.419 align:start position:0%
didn't he also indicated at least part
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
of his budget was already considering
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
certain of the FN bills I mean I know he
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
specifically talked about the 3.1
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
percent for Medicaid being based on a
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
bill that will be an FN but that's
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
already in the budget so some of this
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
may already be in the governor's budget
 
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's a great point so that's what I
 
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:42.539 align:start position:0%
was saying these these estimates here
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
are based on current law if the governor
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
funded one of these programs or a
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
portion of for instance building a we
 
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
know there's new money in there for
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
building Aid so these estimates here
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be something less than that
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
because the governor already funded some
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
of it and these would just be and so as
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
we get hone in on what you're looking to
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
do I would have more precise numbers
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
based on really the incremental change
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
from this document because that's what
 
00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
we don't have to take the governor's
 
00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:10.610 align:start position:0%
we don't have to take the governor's
budget

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
line by well by line by line we really
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
need to but I mean we don't have to
 
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
adopt everything the governor says so if
 
00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:19.380 align:start position:0%
we for example if we know there's a
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventy thousand dollars
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus in the trust then if there are
 
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
things here that we choose to want to
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
fund then we can draw down from that and
 
00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:33.419 align:start position:0%
then we'd have um we could kind of
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
balance that
 
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
but we don't know how much money we have
 
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
overall yet we we have the governor's
 
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
Surplus statements so that shows us the
 
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
general fund big picture and the
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
education trust big picture based on his
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
spending his revenues has this much left
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
over once you have new revenues
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
obviously that picture changes right and
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll adjust that for you
 
00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:57.059 align:start position:0%
then you'll know okay once we've
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
Incorporated the house revenues now that
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
hundred and what was it 170 million or
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
whatever the leftover for Education
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
or 140 no that's not it 148 maybe that
 
00:21:12.169 --> 00:21:12.179 align:start position:0%
is only going to be like 48 because you
 
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
had education Trust on Revenue estimates
 
00:21:15.529 --> 00:21:15.539 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars less than the
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
governor for instance so
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
big picture uh it's the revenues from
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means will drive uh some of the
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
bigger decisions
 
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.029 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the hb521 placement
 
00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
for episode of treatment payments uh the
 
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is indeterminable
 
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
that one is just the build that
 
00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:42.890 align:start position:0%
that one is just the build that
substitutes

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:42.900 align:start position:0%
substitutes
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
the source of funds from the local
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
school district to the you know State I
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
would agree that it's almost impossible
 
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
to project forward accurately because
 
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:54.260 align:start position:0%
it's special education but I would have
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
expected the Department of Education at
 
00:21:59.049 --> 00:21:59.059 align:start position:0%
least to give me a retroactive you know
 
00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
analysis of had we had this deal in this
 
00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
biennium this is how many of those would
 
00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
have fallen to us is that something we
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
can request of them to help us better
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
understand the potential impact because
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
we will have to put a number on it
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
that's a good question so we never got
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
any information from the Department on
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
that bill so there's no fiscal note
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
attached to that at this point the
 
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
reason I had suggested that I get called
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
into this committee is that court
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
ordered placement line item is
 
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
essentially an open warrant so whatever
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
those costs are to the state whether
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's in the budget or not we have to pay
 
00:22:33.649 --> 00:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
so when we do a work session on that
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
bill we'll make sure someone from
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
special education from the Department is
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
here and hopefully can provide some
 
00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
ranges at least of what the cost could
 
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:47.110 align:start position:0%
ranges at least of what the cost could
be

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
indeed but having historical data on
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
what it has been in the past is valuable
 
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
in helping us understand what we may
 
00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:55.860 align:start position:0%
what our exposure is and what we may
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
have left and the department can give
 
00:23:00.289 --> 00:23:00.299 align:start position:0%
you like a 10-year range because they've
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
been collecting it over years and then
 
00:23:04.909 --> 00:23:04.919 align:start position:0%
the any money left in cat aid used to
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
have to go into this fund I don't know
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
is it still the same way it it is but
 
00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
cat AIDS usually yeah it's not fully
 
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
funded so there I don't think there's
 
00:23:17.409 --> 00:23:17.419 align:start position:0%
been yeah but it would lapse to that
 
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
so so this first page here would be I'm
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to capture everything that I think
 
00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
you you should want to consider that's
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
presented to you essentially so the next
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
page is pretty blank too so this is
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
going to be where I populate the house
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
bill two sections that are assigned to
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
this division it's probably going to be
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
more than the cells that I have
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
allocated so and then
 
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
if there's any new ideas that this
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
committee proposes that's not already
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
in-house built to something brand new
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'll list those at the bottom this will
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that this division has a
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation of everything in hose
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
build too before it leaves here we've
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
done our work so you may make no changes
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
to something the governor proposes and
 
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:57.780 align:start position:0%
we would say except you know you're
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
going to accept that as it is uh if
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
there are amendments and this this is
 
00:24:03.529 --> 00:24:03.539 align:start position:0%
really for the new members
 
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:04.190 align:start position:0%
really for the new members
um

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
they come through me I'd be glad to help
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
assist in drafting amendments that way I
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
can keep track of everything make sure
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
the division's got everything we need
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
help help with the any specifics of the
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
language that you're looking to do any
 
00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.549 align:start position:0%
language that you're looking to do any
proposals

00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
um so that's that'll be where we Track
 
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and then the next document
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
will be where I tracked any approved
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
changes to anything that affects funding
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
so that very first page was here's
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
everything that's presented to you and
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
then this page will be okay these are
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
the some of the tentative decisions
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
you've made and I'll start putting them
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
on here just so you remember oh yeah we
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
did vote for that or this will be our
 
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
tracking document of stuff we've done
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
the final thing attached to this was
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
just our uh our one from two years ago
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
just as an example so you can kind of
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
see what this might look like
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
when we're done so this was uh the final
 
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:53.780 align:start position:0%
division two recommendations from the
 
00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
22-23 budget
 
00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:57.539 align:start position:0%
you can you can kind of see what it
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
looks like once we start getting the
 
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
I I just want to put out on the table
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me there's several several
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
ways that can go
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
obviously I'd like to see it in the
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
educational trust fund if it remains
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
but is that something that we need to
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
continue to do and if we do I have to
 
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
agree with uh representative Edwards
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
that it is a 28-day violation and we
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
should Pony up I think his Pony up
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
numbers are way high
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
and I don't see paying for it in arrears
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
so my thought is it it should be in here
 
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
because you you all went through quite a
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
procedure to get it I was not here I was
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
on vacation that term
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
um so it passed and was part of the
 
00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:08.690 align:start position:0%
um so it passed and was part of the
budget

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
so I think it should stay but I think we
 
00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
should re take
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
amend Edward's bill
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking a question as much making a
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
statement we take Edward's Bill and
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
amend it to a lower dollar amount and
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
get rid of the past history is that
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
something we do as an amendment to his
 
00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419 align:start position:0%
bill or do we introduce a new hp2
 
00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:31.750 align:start position:0%
bill or do we introduce a new hp2
section

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
since uh since you are looking to have
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
money attached to it I think we would
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
put in House Bill too so we would
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
estimate so so you're suggesting an
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to say rather than twelve
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
dollars is three dollars three dollars
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
so we would extrapolate out how much do
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
we think three dollars per would be and
 
00:26:51.169 --> 00:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
then we could do an appropriation along
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
with that to the Department of Education
 
00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299 align:start position:0%
to pay these reimbursements and that
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
would be house bill 2. only because it
 
00:26:58.610 --> 00:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
has spending in it I wouldn't want to
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%
send it along in a separate bill because
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
now we we have the budget and then we'd
 
00:27:03.169 --> 00:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
have a separate bill with money I agree
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking a question so when we
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
get to Doe's budget that could be a
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 amendment that we we could
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
have drafted and consider so it would
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
basically be a division two Amendment
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
and the Edwards bill will consider in
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
the in the fall when we do pending and
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
when we do retain bills since we did do
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
a vote to retain that already so we
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
don't have to revisit that when we do a
 
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
retain bill this fall you could itl it
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
then saying we took care of everything
 
00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:34.250 align:start position:0%
then saying we took care of everything
yep

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead Murray
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
with that thought that's going to be the
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
case from any of these right so School
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
building aid for instance right we're
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
not going to pass any of these three
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
School building Aid bills you're going
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
to have a school building Aid policy
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill too and we're going to
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
turn around and probably you'll look to
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
it all these in the fall too same idea
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a few of those that
 
00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
are going to be the ones coming to us on
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom here the ones that we just
 
00:27:59.630 --> 00:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
got yesterday would be the same thing
 
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.730 align:start position:0%
got yesterday would be the same thing
okay

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay on retain bill you can take that
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
and work on it anytime
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
up until what November whatever it is
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's usually October report
 
00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
I mean division two they'll probably
 
00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:25.919 align:start position:0%
just be one executive session as a full
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
committee sometime close to that report
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
deadline but we'll have you know the
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee commute anytime I think they
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
usually don't pay mileage in like July
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
or something like that but any other
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
time in the late summer you know we
 
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
could meet on those it probably would
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
take one day unless you really wanted to
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
dive into a subject matter and have
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
multiple work sessions but chances are I
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
think we'll have hit it all on hp2 I
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
think so too
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
here we go ahead you know on this uh HP
 
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
129 it seems to me that I don't remember
 
00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
should people that spoke for a
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative evidence it seemed to me
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
that they were more in line with
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating the mandate
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:08.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
they said things work really well until
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
like I said I wasn't here when this
 
00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:16.430 align:start position:0%
like I said I wasn't here when this
became

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
became
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
a mandate uh so I I don't know what the
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
hearings were like or anything else so
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming it's something we need we
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
as a body at that time thought it was
 
00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.470 align:start position:0%
as a body at that time thought it was
appropriate

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:35.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
inal ceiling stuff like that
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
and I can see that happening if they
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any skin in the game
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to pay for them you
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
know they're just in the restaurants and
 
00:29:51.769 --> 00:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
that's and that's not me that's the two
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
people that spoke
 
00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:03.830 align:start position:0%
people that spoke
and

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's about demanding
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
it might have worked well for them but
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for the girls right and
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
there are schools that were not
 
00:30:12.649 --> 00:30:12.659 align:start position:0%
providing the products and there were
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
girls that were missing a week of school
 
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
a month because they can't afford the
 
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
products there was also um you know I
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
think we could have a discussion around
 
00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
the language that it has to be in the
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
bathroom because some of the schools
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
were saying well you can go to the PE
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
teacher you can go to the nurse but that
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
there was a for some a stigma attached
 
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
to that that you know it was
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
embarrassing for the girls to do that it
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
was kind of in line with the free and
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch where you hadn't you had
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
like your hand stamped or something or
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
you had a different colored tab so
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
everybody knew that you had free and
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and high school kids
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
weren't doing that because they were
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
embarrassed so this is a way of trying
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
to provide a mechanism that allowed
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
girls to to go through you know to get
 
00:30:54.889 --> 00:30:54.899 align:start position:0%
what they needed without the
 
00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:56.700 align:start position:0%
embarrassment about it
 
00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:57.830 align:start position:0%
embarrassment about it
um

00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:00.059 align:start position:0%
you oh I'm sorry yeah the level of
 
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980 align:start position:0%
poverty would blow your mind in some
 
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
places it's just it goes beyond the pale
 
00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:09.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
Nashville School District I think the
 
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:19.630 align:start position:0%
Nashville School District I think the
figures

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
so school districts haven't been
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
invested they've had to invest what it
 
00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:27.539 align:start position:0%
is is they had to put dispensers into
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
many of the breasts we didn't say that
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
for a while in the war just that they
 
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to be completely available to teach
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
young women and so um
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
it has been read or interpreted that it
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
has to be dispensers and that's been the
 
00:31:45.529 --> 00:31:45.539 align:start position:0%
cost so I don't know if I'm going to
 
00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.059 align:start position:0%
amend it to ease the restrictions
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
apparently that they just have to be
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
available in multiple places of the
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
schools choosing that there will be no
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
Stigma attached to obtaining a female
 
00:31:58.799 --> 00:31:59.810 align:start position:0%
Stigma attached to obtaining a female
product

00:31:59.810 --> 00:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to do something like that
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
but there has been a cost to school I'm
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
absolutely shot but I've been query the
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
school district since Community evidence
 
00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:10.620 align:start position:0%
discussions and there has been an
 
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
expense that it's already been incurred
 
00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
so they have spent the money they have
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
they are carrying this bill out so
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
people have already thought well when I
 
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:22.620 align:start position:0%
mentioned the cost of them
 
00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:30.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
I've been in this division before I just
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
know the final man graduated eighth
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
grade he had eight children
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
and my sisters were all set
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
that was a while ago there was no
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
freedom to be response either
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
I didn't talk to you about getting in
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
if if I may just I I look back at the
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
the emails uh that we received on that
 
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:01.980 align:start position:0%
particular bill we got an email from
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
somebody who thought that we were trying
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
to remove the you know policy and that
 
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
was not the case but uh when uh
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards replied uh he did
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
point out that the Auburn Village School
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
principal who testified was bothered by
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
the state mandate and the enormous waste
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
and extra cost it has added so
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
the point is that
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
if it is the will of the committee to
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
not Tinker with a policy it may behoove
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
the committee to just maybe clarify the
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
language a little to eliminate that
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
perception of you know the need for a
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
dispenser in the bathroom that seems to
 
00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
be the huge you know if that's the right
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
policy I you know I I all I'm you know
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
spouse right now well but if we change
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
you know we may I mean if we are going
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
to reduce the appropriation from what
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
was suggested originally we may have a
 
00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:02.220 align:start position:0%
ability to make it clear what that is
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
supposed to cover and what the Mandate
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
really says you know especially since
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
all we are talking about is clarifying
 
00:34:10.609 --> 00:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
which I'm hearing people say that it was
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding of what the Mandate
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
really was you know I'm it's not my
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
intent to change the legislature in the
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
legislatures you know mandate on that
 
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.470 align:start position:0%
legislatures you know mandate on that
but

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.190 align:start position:0%
but
yeah

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
the project process and we're getting
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
sidetracked no we're gonna have to make
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
a decision on this
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
yeah this is in our lap
 
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
we're not getting sidetracked I said
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
when I open it up I'm going to jump in
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
the weeds because I've been thinking
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
about this okay
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to get
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay Mary
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
schools already pay for paper towels and
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
toilet paper and soap and soap
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
dispensers so there is a line somewhere
 
00:34:57.849 --> 00:34:57.859 align:start position:0%
in the school budget for this stuff
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
again around the stigma thing if
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we could possibly do
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
that but I mean it's like why isn't that
 
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
folded into that line instead of being
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
singled out because again that's draws
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
more attention perhaps than what some
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
people would like but I don't know you
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
know this money that I think I think we
 
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:19.500 align:start position:0%
owe the the school something if we're
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
asking them to do this but having it
 
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
folded into what would we eventually be
 
00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
considered normally supplied materials
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
for a bathroom I mean you don't go into
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
any public bathroom and bring your own
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
toilet paper you know it's just provided
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
and most bathrooms now provide hygiene
 
00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.410 align:start position:0%
and most bathrooms now provide hygiene
huh

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.010 align:start position:0%
huh
okay

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:42.380 align:start position:0%
right no that's that's absolutely right
 
00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
so but mostly even you know restaurants
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
and stuff there's a drawer in those
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
restrooms that provide all this material
 
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:51.180 align:start position:0%
usually at least the restaurants I go
 
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
line of things that schools need to
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
provide well I've got an amendment that
 
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.589 align:start position:0%
provide well I've got an amendment that
uh

00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
was provided to me almost two days later
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
that changed the wording of the first
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
line that just said it'd make it
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
available and take the bathroom take the
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called no no no it says in
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
the bathroom right or not bad I can't
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
think of the language but it
 
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
specifically says this is where it's got
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
and this amendment uh
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
took that language out and just said
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
available so I'll bring that with me
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
when I when we get some serious about
 
00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
this so this is a good example so if if
 
00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
you have an amendment that you'd like to
 
00:36:56.810 --> 00:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
propose to the committee you can work
 
00:36:58.370 --> 00:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
with me and I can draft something so it
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
could be changing the amount of the
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
reimbursement it could be changing the
 
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
mandate to a you should do this thing
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
whatever if there's something on one of
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you would like to propose to the
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
committee for consideration just reach
 
00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:11.460 align:start position:0%
out to me and I can help draft an
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
amendment for you and then we'll have a
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
document to you know vote on or uh you
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
know as we get to that subject matter
 
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
because all these will be carried on
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
here which means they're always up for
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
sub subject to an amendment or debate or
 
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
or a motion or whatever so
 
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:26.569 align:start position:0%
or a motion or whatever so
um

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
because right now if we did nothing with
 
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
that but retain it
 
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
uh the current policy would be in effect
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
and that is whatever the language is and
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to the school to pay for it
 
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.650 align:start position:0%
it's it's up to the school to pay for it
correct

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I will point out because I I make
 
00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.829 align:start position:0%
and I will point out because I I make
mistakes

00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:49.700 align:start position:0%
on that line if you look at fiscal uh 25
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's 600 and that's supposed
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
to be 630 000 not 6.3 million so I have
 
00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
so it's not that much money oh okay so
 
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
it just just saved you six million
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
dollars okay what up the top so what are
 
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:11.220 align:start position:0%
we going to spend there I think one I
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
think this is one too many zeros there
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
yeah so there should be 630 000 I
 
00:38:16.849 --> 00:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
believe if I remember correctly from the
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the language in question I
 
00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
looked up the Bailey's uh available at
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
no cost in all gender neutral bathrooms
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
and bathrooms designated for females
 
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
located in public middle and high
 
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
so that's essentially what I wanted to
 
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:43.460 align:start position:0%
go through today was kind of big picture
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
process we will have to talk about what
 
00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:48.780 align:start position:0%
days we're meeting I did build out a
 
00:38:50.810 --> 00:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
tentative schedule and actually have
 
00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
agencies booked through March 1st after
 
00:38:54.829 --> 00:38:54.839 align:start position:0%
that nothing is scheduled for for
 
00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
division two officially yet we're gonna
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
have session days that will interfere
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
with ability to do work town meeting day
 
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
is in there I don't know if that's a day
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
that we I'm out that day so that that'd
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
be a day that at the very most you would
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
maybe hear from somebody with no
 
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:12.060 align:start position:0%
intention of voting if all your members
 
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:13.020 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be here potentially
 
00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
still use the data to hear a
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
presentation or uh and then we're gonna
 
00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
have a house bill one and two public
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
hearing at some point so we may lose a
 
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:27.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's happened that we do a
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
public meeting in different parts of the
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
state to get different things um I don't
 
00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:38.220 align:start position:0%
recall that Weiler did not do that the
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
last round
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
do we we did it virtually okay have you
 
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
heard anything about going around the
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
state yet I haven't heard anything uh
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
yeah two years ago we did Zoom public
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
hearings actually we had folks
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
registering and did a zoom public
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
hearing uh four years ago I carry in
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
Laconia I think we we've done we did
 
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.290 align:start position:0%
Laconia I think we we've done we did
here

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
Dairy and Laconia we've done Dairy
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
Laconia I'm trying to remember we've
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
done Nashville before we've done
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
Whitefield before
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
possibly possibly so but I have I
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
haven't heard either a date or uh if
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
there's going to be any traveling public
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
hearings I don't know
 
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.450 align:start position:0%
hearings I don't know
okay

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that's where I learned fate with
 
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.690 align:start position:0%
yeah that's where I learned fate with
bank

00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
and one thing you heard a lot today was
 
00:40:27.530 --> 00:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
education funding that was a big thing
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be a big lift
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
potentially for this division depending
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
on how much work you want to do in that
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
area the governor's budget is going to
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
come out we get House Bill too that's I
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
believe going to have 24 or 25 and
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
possibly out years different formulas so
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
the department will come in and give us
 
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
a briefing on that hopefully walk us
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
through the changes
 
00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:49.619 align:start position:0%
um in the law and what that means on a
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
Town by Town level
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
we'll have yeah they'll have a
 
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.130 align:start position:0%
we'll have yeah they'll have a
spreadsheet

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
um hopefully they should and a town by
 
00:40:59.569 --> 00:40:59.579 align:start position:0%
Town showing current law versus proposed
 
00:41:01.069 --> 00:41:01.079 align:start position:0%
so you can kind of see the town by Town
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
estimated impact uh and then as you get
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
into different proposals changing either
 
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
some of the amounts or changing it
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you look to do just keep in
 
00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
mind that could take me and the
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
department it's not quick to turn that
 
00:41:16.609 --> 00:41:16.619 align:start position:0%
stuff around you know it's really a
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
quality control thing we just want to
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
make sure we're not doing stuff too
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
quick and end up with errors so
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we get into I think the governor
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
referred to spreadsheet Wars today uh
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
where you know we'll we'll come up with
 
00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets for another a new Amendment
 
00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
a proposal and everyone will look to see
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
their town and how they did and we'll
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
try to keep up with that as much as
 
00:41:33.599 --> 00:41:34.810 align:start position:0%
try to keep up with that as much as
possible

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:34.820 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:41:36.829 --> 00:41:36.839 align:start position:0%
but it's hard for us to turn around
 
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
super quickly multiple times throughout
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
the process but just want to throw that
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:05.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
I hope so we've requested a fiscal note
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
even on the bill is introduced I know it
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
was amended uh I think there was an
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment on that bill
 
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:18.370 align:start position:0%
amendment on that bill
um

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
right right uh so instead of a new
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
Department was that the one yeah it'd be
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
a division within doe so no we haven't
 
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
we haven't received any uh
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
analysis from the Department so out of
 
00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
those nine bills I've identified five
 
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
that I think we possibly could do
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
retain because they're definitely going
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be House Bill 2 budget items and
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's 419 420
 
00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:45.050 align:start position:0%
that's 419 420
542

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:45.060 align:start position:0%
542
 
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.730 align:start position:0%
542
560.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
560.
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
and 638 638 you might actually be able
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
to just pass but I think because we are
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
touching dead funding formula we'll
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
probably want to retain that one too so
 
00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
if we retain all those we know those are
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 budget issues the other
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
four bills 364 521 620 and 626 I think
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to need the department of
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
education's experts to come in just to
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
explain what's going on and then the
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee could decide what you want to
 
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:15.260 align:start position:0%
do with those if you want to pass them
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh 620 and 626 would probably be budget
 
00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.410 align:start position:0%
uh 620 and 626 would probably be budget
items

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:20.420 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
364 and 521 could possibly pass
 
00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
separately without having to amend the
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
budget depending on what we hear
 
00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:37.910 align:start position:0%
budget depending on what we hear
potentially

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's on the 28th when we we do have
 
00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:41.220 align:start position:0%
the department schedule for an entire
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
day so we'll hear from them for their
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
operating budget to kind of go through
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so they'll they'll um my guess
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
is two hours in the morning we'll go
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
through all of this and then three hours
 
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:02.220 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon will be efas and
 
00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:05.099 align:start position:0%
funding and uh including Charters and
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
school building Aid is what I'm
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
envisioning those education trust fund
 
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
Aid programs will probably take up most
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
of the time and hopefully we have host
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
Bill too by then that would make things
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
easier that they could kind of walk
 
00:44:17.089 --> 00:44:17.099 align:start position:0%
through the changes in House Bill 2 and
 
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheets but even without House
 
00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 it'll still be valuable to hear
 
00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.099 align:start position:0%
from them and kind of see the numbers
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
I have a quick thought on 129 but I
 
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
didn't want to break the flow if we were
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
going in a different direction
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
one of the bills that I was a co-sponsor
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
on was a bill that would have provided
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
hygiene products to inmates and in order
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
to avoid any confusion and to avoid
 
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
political controversy over gender
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
language to build that bill used the
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
language of you know inmates who
 
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.329 align:start position:0%
language of you know inmates who
menstruate

00:44:56.329 --> 00:44:56.339 align:start position:0%
menstruate
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
uh obviously I'm not really
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
you know hugely invested in changing the
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
language in a similar manner but I did
 
00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
want to share that as a possibility if
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to file amendments here to
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
consider you know ways in which uh you
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
know we avoid the whole
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
definition questions around those topics
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth so no but the
 
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
point is you know students who
 
00:45:26.089 --> 00:45:26.099 align:start position:0%
menstruate you know
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
would be a better language that would
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
try to walk us out of that Minefield and
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
it's exactly what the point is you know
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
if you menstruate you need hygiene
 
00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
products if you don't you don't I don't
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
want to know anything else you know
 
00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:55.730 align:start position:0%
want to know anything else you know
right

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:10.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
it will see that so you won't you won't
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
see it for lottery because they don't
 
00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:11.339 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:47:14.089 --> 00:47:14.099 align:start position:0%
um but certainly safety is the is one
 
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of different funding
 
00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
sources so at the end of each accounting
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
unit so just to give everyone a
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
refresher so if we look at Lottery there
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
so it starts halfway down the page there
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
with 2028
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
Lottery division that's an accounting
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
unit so this accounting unit Lottery
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
basically has one accounting unit for
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
their entire budget continues on to the
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
next page
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at the kind of the
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
very bottom it's estimated source of
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
funds for this accounting unit
 
00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:42.839 align:start position:0%
and most of it is sweepstakes funds
 
00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's really all they have for 24 and
 
00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
25 which is their Lottery fund so they
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
collect Lottery revenues net their
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
expenses against that remit the
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
difference to the education trust fund
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
so this is a pretty simple budget that's
 
00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:57.660 align:start position:0%
kind of why we kind of do them usually
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
at the beginning there's no General
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
funds here
 
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.069 align:start position:0%
funds here
um

00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:01.079 --> 00:48:21.430 align:start position:0%
um
foreign

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
so yeah the accounting unit expenditure
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
class lines adds up to and I'll just use
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 22 actual line I've got 13
 
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
259 841 and then if you and then if you
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
look at the total sources of funds it's
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
13 259 841. hopefully those all balance
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
everywhere if those don't balance
 
00:48:43.930 --> 00:48:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
right yeah and then if you flip over
 
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
because I'll point this out this is
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
what's great about this version of the
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
budget future versions don't have this
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
is you have the number of authorized
 
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:55.740 align:start position:0%
positions in each accounting unit so on
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
the on page 1211 you'll see that there's
 
00:49:01.309 --> 00:49:01.319 align:start position:0%
82 permanent classified positions
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
currently and four unclassifieds but if
 
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:05.220 align:start position:0%
you jump ahead you can see their
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
complement goes up to 89 uh unclassified
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
positions so when the department when
 
00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
Lottery comes in tomorrow
 
00:49:14.329 --> 00:49:14.339 align:start position:0%
you'd say oh you have seven new
 
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
positions so they'll tell you about
 
00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.089 align:start position:0%
positions so they'll tell you about
those

00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
a lot lottery for the most part is
 
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:28.700 align:start position:0%
usually if they have some technical
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
Corrections they maybe put money in the
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
wrong class line and they want you to
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
switch it or you know there's been some
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
new offerings in the last few years
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mobile gaming sports betting Kino for
 
00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
instance so they have added some
 
00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
positions relative to overseeing those
 
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:43.460 align:start position:0%
programs that we've done in the budget
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure what these seven
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
represent off the top of my head it
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure so that's something
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
we'll hear from tomorrow we'll hear from
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
Tomorrow yep and again House Bill 2 has
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
been something Lottery has had over the
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
years and I just don't really know what
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
is in there for for them for House Bill
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
2. uh Charlie McIntyre the director may
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.609 --> 00:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
yeah Charlie will talk about the revenue
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
estimate how much he thinks he's going
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
to give to the education trust fund and
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
his budget is basically what he needs to
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
yep oh yeah it could be relative to that
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming is is is growing could
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
so yeah a lot so several probably at
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
least three budgets ago now racing and
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming commission merged with
 
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.910 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming commission merged with
Lottery

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
Lottery
 
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.109 align:start position:0%
Lottery
so

00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
um charitable gaming is part of the
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.569 --> 00:51:56.579 align:start position:0%
yes that's for that the administrative
 
00:51:59.329 --> 00:51:59.339 align:start position:0%
and standards accounting unit 8980 they
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
have multiple accounting units at police
 
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
standards so if you flip the next page
 
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
you'll see the accounting unit for the
 
00:52:06.829 --> 00:52:06.839 align:start position:0%
police crisis intervention training so
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
this was something that was a bill last
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
year that appropriated money you can see
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
that 1.1 million and the governor
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
appears to be uh extending that into the
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
next two years so director skippa can
 
00:52:20.089 --> 00:52:20.099 align:start position:0%
talk about that program tomorrow
 
00:52:22.370 --> 00:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh and you can
 
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.230 align:start position:0%
uh and you can
yeah

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
and then uh continuing on they have a
 
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740 align:start position:0%
separate accounting unit specific to
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
their training so on page one two one
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
five accounting unit 6639 so they've got
 
00:52:35.329 --> 00:52:35.339 align:start position:0%
the two major accounting units the
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
administration and standards and the law
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement training as far as their
 
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
normal routine operating budget and you
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
can see their positions there so so just
 
00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
to point out so when you look at the
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 1215 you see they're
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
currently have 14 positions and now
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're the governor's budget is 15. so
 
00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:53.339 align:start position:0%
I expect director skippa would speak to
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
oh this budget includes a new position
 
00:52:56.329 --> 00:52:56.339 align:start position:0%
that's doing this and if not that would
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
be a good question you could ask oh I
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
see your position count goes up what's
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the new position quick
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
um quick question about the formatting
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
of the Excel document
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'm always looking for ways to you know
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
throw a pivot table here and there and
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a format that would
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
make that very uh difficult if not
 
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:15.950 align:start position:0%
make that very uh difficult if not
impossible

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
is this something that we could maybe
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
work with the governor's budget people
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
going forward so that the electronic
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
version of this is something that we can
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
slice and dice a bit more easily right
 
00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
now this becomes basically a just one
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
big that I cannot really
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
easily aggregate in different ways and
 
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700 align:start position:0%
compare stuff and if you do you have the
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
Excel version of this
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
it is posted online it is clunky it is
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
like you described it is kind of a big
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
sheet of just data
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
um there there are a couple methods to
 
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
filter out
 
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:52.980 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little bit more user
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
friendly but it hasn't been something
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
we've delved in a whole lot and it would
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
take admin Services Bureau of financial
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
reporting to I'm not asking for this
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
cycle frankly I understand that this is
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
what we get right now the work of
 
00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
redoing this to feed the requirement
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
would be ridiculous but you know
 
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:17.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
so those are the two uh
 
00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
State departments if you will or
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
agencies that we have tomorrow and then
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
we also have U.S and H and ccsnh which
 
00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
just get their block appropriation from
 
00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
the state so each of their they are in
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
this operating budget but they just have
 
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
one line and uh they'll speak to what
 
00:54:36.049 --> 00:54:36.059 align:start position:0%
that state support would mean and if
 
00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:37.460 align:start position:0%
there is any that
 
00:54:39.829 --> 00:54:39.839 align:start position:0%
between what the governor gave them and
 
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:41.220 align:start position:0%
what they were asking for in their
 
00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:42.780 align:start position:0%
agency budget request you'll hear about
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow too
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
so fishing game starts on page 561 but
 
00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
they also have a separate Surplus
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
statement for the fish and game fund
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
that is almost better to just know the
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
big picture of the state of their uh
 
00:55:47.089 --> 00:55:47.099 align:start position:0%
their because they are a self-funded
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
Agency for the most part so if you have
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
your um executive summary that green
 
00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:55.740 align:start position:0%
folder from the the front there on page
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
31 of that document you'll see the fish
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
and game Surplus statement
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they are in much better condition
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
than they were six or so years ago for
 
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:05.089 align:start position:0%
than they were six or so years ago for
sure

00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
so if you look if you look on this
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
Surplus here on page 31
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
it breaks out their unrestricted
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
revenues their license fees
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
predominantly around 13.3 million
 
00:56:23.089 --> 00:56:23.099 align:start position:0%
dollars it's estimated 13.4 moving
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
forward you can see the general fund
 
00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:25.970 align:start position:0%
forward you can see the general fund
support

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:27.900 align:start position:0%
that the governor is proposing 1 million
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
and 24 and one and a half million and
 
00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.950 align:start position:0%
and 24 and one and a half million and
25.

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
25.
 
00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then if you look at their
 
00:56:34.809 --> 00:56:34.819 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in the next section down
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
15.9 million and 23 16.3 16.2
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
um the the governor did budget the pay
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
raise because those would apply to the
 
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game fund would cover the fish
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
and game employees for that and then
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
going down you'll see that they are
 
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.849 align:start position:0%
going down you'll see that they are
running

00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
running
 
00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:53.460 align:start position:0%
a negative current year balance so they
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
are pulling from their fund balance to
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
to be sustainable each each year so on
 
00:56:59.569 --> 00:56:59.579 align:start position:0%
that current year balance line You'll
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
see they've got a negative result there
 
00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
currently if you're looking for fiscal
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
22 ended 9.9 million dollars at the very
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
bottom the Gap adjusted balance is going
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
down to 7 million by the end of this
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium so they are they do
 
00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
have money in the bank but as you can
 
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
see this Governor's recommended budget
 
00:57:18.890 --> 00:57:18.900 align:start position:0%
is chipping away at that balance each
 
00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.910 align:start position:0%
is chipping away at that balance each
year

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:46.990 align:start position:0%
year
foreign

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
so they're coming in on the first March
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
1st and we can ask them about that I
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
think there is a bill that mandates that
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
they do that by 25. yeah and I think
 
00:57:56.809 --> 00:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
they're phasing in renewals first and
 
00:57:58.730 --> 00:57:58.740 align:start position:0%
then initials so you can ask them how
 
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:00.740 align:start position:0%
that's going I think they've said that
 
00:58:03.109 --> 00:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
Manpower is more the issue than than
 
00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
money but they can speak more to that
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
when when you have them and if you want
 
00:58:19.849 --> 00:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.569 --> 00:58:23.579 align:start position:0%
so those five are essentially or I don't
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to say easier but as far as uh you
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
know fishing game is usually pretty easy
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
you just decide on your general fund
 
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.650 align:start position:0%
you just decide on your general fund
support

00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:32.420 align:start position:0%
um if you choose to do any
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
ccsnation usnh are difficult from a
 
00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:35.930 align:start position:0%
ccsnation usnh are difficult from a
dollar

00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
perspective because you're in the
 
00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:38.280 align:start position:0%
millions you're talking a lot of money
 
00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know when you're making changes
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
there but it is just one line item no
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
Personnel you don't deal with positions
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
with those two entities and fishing uh
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
police standards and Lottery tend to be
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
on the easier end for division two just
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
because the the agencies are small
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh doe Dot and safety is the bigger
 
00:58:55.260 --> 00:59:11.390 align:start position:0%
uh doe Dot and safety is the bigger
workload

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
I think I think from a revenue point of
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
view I think revenues were down a little
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
bit because travel was down I think yeah
 
00:59:20.870 --> 00:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
and as far as the highway fund
 
00:59:22.849 --> 00:59:22.859 align:start position:0%
I mean they've had vacancy issues just
 
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
like a lot of State departments have so
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of money not being
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
spent from the highway fund because they
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
haven't had the person all the manpower
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
to to spend it so they've lapsed Dot and
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
safety have lapped quite a bit of money
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
back into the highway fund from budgeted
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
amounts so they closed fiscal 22 with a
 
00:59:37.619 --> 00:59:39.049 align:start position:0%
amounts so they closed fiscal 22 with a
significant

00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
balance ending balance and the general
 
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
fund if you recall we did send 50
 
00:59:44.569 --> 00:59:44.579 align:start position:0%
million I believe of General funds to
 
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:47.220 align:start position:0%
prop up the highway fund last budget as
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
well as I think they used some federal
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
funds to uh support Highway funded
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
operations too to take the burden off
 
00:59:55.609 --> 00:59:55.619 align:start position:0%
the highway fund so that helped the last
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
budget I think the Surplus statement so
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
I can jump real quick to the the highway
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
fund also has a surplus statement in
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
this document it's on page 30 where we
 
01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
so here you'll see the the two major
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
sources of revenue which is our road
 
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
toll and motor vehicle fees so licensing
 
01:00:17.099 --> 01:00:19.789 align:start position:0%
toll and motor vehicle fees so licensing
registrations

01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
minus the department of safety and I
 
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
think they had testified to that or
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
presented this when they were in a week
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
or so ago DMV predominantly in their
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
Road tool Bureau
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
cover the costs that they have to
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
administer the collection of those
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
revenues so they keep that and then
 
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:37.200 align:start position:0%
remit the uh the net to the highway fund
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
and that's that total editions line you
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
see here
 
01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
and then uh Department of Transportation
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and the judicial
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
branch all get Appropriations from the
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
highway fund if you look fiscal 22
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
actual the Gap adjusted balance was over
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
but if you look ahead of what the
 
01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:56.900 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
supports it ends at only 13 million
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
dollars so you can see each year is
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
running a deficit balance similar to uh
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
fish and game fund not quite as or fish
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
and game funds not quite as dramatic as
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
this and when the department comes in
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
they can testify to well what's included
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
what are we doing what does that include
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
funding usually equipment winter
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
maintenance Highway Maintenance those
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
are the big areas but they'll speak to
 
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
that when they come in on
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
the with a the 21st Tuesday this coming
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:45.299 align:start position:0%
it's a good question for them I will
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
just remind you that's the turnpike
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
system so the toll collections wouldn't
 
01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
impact the highway fund at all the
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
turnpike is a separate fund
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
from toll revenues to fund just those
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
Lane miles that are designated as the
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
turnpike system so when we're talking
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
Highway fund we're talking about State
 
01:02:01.569 --> 01:02:01.579 align:start position:0%
roadways that are not the turnpike fund
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
uh but they'll speak to the specifics of
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.079 --> 01:03:19.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:19.799 --> 01:04:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
goodness

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
so as far as the highway fund and Fish
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
and Game fund similar to General and
 
01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:10.260 align:start position:0%
education Ways and Means we'll do those
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
revenues as well so when we get our
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
resolution from from ways and means I'll
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
plug in those numbers to these Surplus
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
statements and it'll give you an updated
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
picture where you're starting
 
01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.589 --> 01:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
yeah Our Hope was by one March but we'll
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
see yeah yeah we'll we'll see how I'm
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
not sure how how quickly it'll come out
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're hope we're hoping for sooner than
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
later because that helps us committee
 
01:04:42.059 --> 01:04:42.829 align:start position:0%
later because that helps us committee
out

01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:44.870 align:start position:0%
out
uh

01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
and then any bills too that are flying
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
around that impact revenues will also
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
update the Surplus statements based on
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
those hopefully we capture those into
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
the budget package and they're not
 
01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
separate and the other thing I will
 
01:04:57.650 --> 01:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
point out is
 
01:04:59.210 --> 01:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
um fiscal committee has a winter
 
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:02.220 align:start position:0%
maintenance item uh this meeting that
 
01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
the department needs to draw from
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus to prop up their winter
 
01:05:07.609 --> 01:05:07.619 align:start position:0%
maintenance budget for this year I think
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's around three and a half million
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
dollars so if that passes fiscal and GNC
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
when we update I'll update the Surplus
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
statement that you're working off of so
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
that 13.3 may go to 9.5 right off the
 
01:05:22.490 --> 01:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
bat you know
 
01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:26.990 align:start position:0%
bat you know
issue

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
I think fiscal will hear fiscal will
 
01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
hear their their testimony if if they
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
fast on Friday but the letter does does
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
detail the rates that they're paying to
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:52.130 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
and and my guess is when they present
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
their budget Tuesday
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
um the governor probably address one way
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
or another the contracted rates that
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
they are able to pay for winter
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
maintenance so I think they'll speak to
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh so Highway funds Surplus statements
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
on page 30 of that executive summary
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
and while representative Buco is looking
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm really concerned that we are going
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
from an actual at the end of 22 over 111
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
to a recommended of 13.1 by the end of
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
25 I mean that's literally burning
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
through 100 million dollars of surplus
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
then what how is that sustainable so
 
01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:36.299 align:start position:0%
that that's been a question for well
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
over a decade with the highway fund
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of what have been
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
referred to as one-time fixes to prop up
 
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
the highway fund either a temporary
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
Revenue change a transfer from General
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
funds uh so so the department will speak
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
to that too on Tuesday but that they've
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's always been an issue because some
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
of the traditional Road tools
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
specifically for Highway fund revenue is
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
is stagnant or decreasing at best so
 
01:07:01.910 --> 01:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
whereas most of the costs from Highway
 
01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
funds are people and those costs
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
inherently increase over time so so that
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
formula has has been an issue for a long
 
01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:10.490 align:start position:0%
formula has has been an issue for a long
time

01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:48.890 align:start position:0%
time
foreign

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:51.740 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think
 
01:07:53.990 --> 01:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
without seeing House Bill 2 it's hard
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
for me to say specifically what's
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
happening there
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
um I think what the phases are are the
 
01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:02.280 align:start position:0%
different years I think you know so
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
looking this biennium and then and
 
01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
things will change starting in fiscal 25
 
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 so I think when we see House
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 we'll see that outline better and
 
01:08:11.450 --> 01:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
when we hear from the Department they'll
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
walk us through that
 
01:08:13.319 --> 01:08:15.829 align:start position:0%
walk us through that
um

01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.839 --> 01:08:17.269 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
the base amount is going to be increased
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced differentiated will
 
01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
be increased I think the stabilization
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
Grant as we know it is going away but
 
01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:38.339 align:start position:0%
will be replaced with a new hold
 
01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:55.550 align:start position:0%
will be replaced with a new hold
harmless

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:57.970 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:08:57.970 --> 01:08:57.980 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
everyone's

01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
very cute
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
they kept everything in two thousand
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
nights yeah but we've lost 250 kids at
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
least we lost a town Middleton and we're
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
still getting the same amount of
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
stabilization as we got in yeah because
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
it's fixed by dollars not by 2012 when
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
that number was calculated that hard
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount has been the same amount
 
01:10:27.610 --> 01:10:27.620 align:start position:0%
that you're getting today
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know and I'm getting you know I
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
wow

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:39.980 align:start position:0%
my superintendent will take the money
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
but matter of fact we're paying the same
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
you know we're our budget is increasing
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
and our our population is deep well this
 
01:10:50.750 --> 01:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
this year remember seven about seven
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
ninety we lost 44 student texture
 
01:10:56.689 --> 01:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
so and you know and that's
 
01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and 143 students did not make
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
out or parents did not make out the free
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
and reduced form now that's what almost
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
300 000 which is part of what we need to
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
address but that's what we need to we
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
need to look at my understanding of what
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
the governor wants to do with the
 
01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
stabilization is to
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
at some point you know give them 10
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
years to adjust with at least a few
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
years where there will be no downside
 
01:11:24.050 --> 01:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
but with a clear visibility of a
 
01:11:26.450 --> 01:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
downslope where they are expected to
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
understand that they need to plan
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
accordingly because those hard numbers
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
are based on number of kids that they
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
haven't had for a long time and it gives
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
them a fair warning than a gentle slope
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you know it will have to be
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:48.659 align:start position:0%
middle class which I I don't think the
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
intent is to do that at all I think the
 
01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
intent is to basically adjust the
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
funding till it is Equitable with every
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
other town in the state and basically
 
01:11:59.570 --> 01:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
remove this temporary additional benefit
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
that they are getting because of that
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
but to you know make it equally fair
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
with everybody that's again my
 
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
understanding of the intent of that we
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
haven't really read hb2 That's based on
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
a presentation oh I'm aware of the
 
01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:29.689 align:start position:0%
a presentation oh I'm aware of the
history

01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
right I think so so that one thing I
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
will say does Tuesday Morning work for
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
an egg uh work session on some of those
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
bills we can just retain because we know
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
there'll be budget just to be done with
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
it okay so I don't know if we
 
01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily need two hours we maybe
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
could just do 11 and because I think
 
01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
there's probably five bills we could
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
retain and then the other four that we
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
have to work on we will probably need
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
agency folks in it might be a little bit
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
longer and I'm not sure I can get them
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
in on this quick of a turnaround
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
we have dot at one o'clock in the
 
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:02.290 align:start position:0%
we have dot at one o'clock in the
afternoon

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:02.300 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
01:13:05.330 --> 01:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay I'll see what I can schedule I
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
think Janet's deadline for the calendar
 
01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
is at three today so I'm gonna I'll see
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
who I can Wrangle up but just the Cloudy
 
01:13:16.850 --> 01:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
fight we meet tomorrow
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
yes but we do not meet on Friday
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
and we do not meet on Monday next week
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
so oh I forgot it's a legal holiday but
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
we have Thursday and then Tuesday or the
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
next two days when we meet I'm just
 
01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
trying to balance my schedule and and
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is held for a possible session
 
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is held for a possible session
day

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
and we were still told to hold that so I
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't think by the time I find out if
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
there is a session we probably wouldn't
 
01:13:45.890 --> 01:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
really be able to use that day anyways
 
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I think next week will only be
 
01:13:49.970 --> 01:13:49.980 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and the following week we'll do
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh build work sessions on these bills
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
that we get referred and that's the
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
other thing so next next week on the
 
01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
floor we're likely going to get way more
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
bills from because education is exacting
 
01:14:06.290 --> 01:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
a lot today and tomorrow
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna doing House Bill one and
 
01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
two will be a lot of work and then when
 
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
you factor in possibly up to like 20
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
separate bills you know that you know we
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
made to consider so but we'll keep track
 
01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
he has yeah we had a chat this morning
 
01:14:24.719 --> 01:14:40.870 align:start position:0%
he has yeah we had a chat this morning
and

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
possibly 10 if yeah if I can if I can
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
get an agency it'd really be doe if I if
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
their folks can come talk about a couple
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
of these other bills maybe we'll try to
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:16:40.550 --> 01:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.560 --> 01:17:57.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
well you know what I'd rather give your
