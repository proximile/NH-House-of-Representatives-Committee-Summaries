00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
one o'clock uh we're gonna convene the
 
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
division three work session
 
00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 align:start position:0%
um we're we're all we're all here
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
representative uh nordgren is is not
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
going to be able to be with us today and
 
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have a representative Weiler uh
 
00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
sitting in for now
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
um so so we're now open and
 
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.250 align:start position:0%
um so so we're now open and
um

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
first order of business I think we're
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to just jump right into hearing
 
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner
 
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
the the point of having the commissioner
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
come and lead us off was to just give us
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to hear from her directly
 
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 align:start position:0%
on how she describes uh her priorities
 
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
and I I don't necessarily mean you know
 
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
Financial priorities but the Strategic
 
00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 align:start position:0%
priorities of of what services her
 
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
Department provides that are that are
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
key that we need to have an eye on and
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
then of course there are budget
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
implications that we should try to align
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
and support the commissioner's
 
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
strategies where we can so uh
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to come up and get
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
started and can somebody confirm for me
 
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 align:start position:0%
that we're on YouTube that it's worth
 
00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:06.770 align:start position:0%
that we're on YouTube that it's worth
streaming

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Lori Weaver interim
 
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:start position:0%

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
I stole Nathan's presentation he has
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
paperwork so then he took it back I was
 
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
trying to find mine and Nathan white
 
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
Chief Financial Officer with the
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so just just to start off um I I just
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
want to contextualize the information
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we're going to present to you today
 
00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
um so before you we have a high level
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
overview of the department and the
 
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
purpose the goal um from my perspective
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
today is first to talk about uh to your
 
00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
point representative Edwards
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
um first to talk about what what the
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner's vision and strategic plan
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
is and you'll see that in the first
 
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
couple of slides some of these will look
 
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
a little familiar just from the last
 
00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 align:start position:0%
time just to just to make sure that
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same page and then
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
afterwards we're going to talk about
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
each of the division level or agency
 
00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539 align:start position:0%
level areas of the department and and
 
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
the respective divisions and also touch
 
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
on what what do we expect to be points
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
of discussion uh in the in the upcoming
 
00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
meetings that we have scheduled over the
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
coming weeks as well as provided this as
 
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for you know if you do
 
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
have some initial questions you know we
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
can raise those today if I can't answer
 
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
them today I can get I can bring those
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
back if there's additional presentations
 
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
that you haven't seen on the agenda you
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
know that that you would like to have
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
um you know I'd like to start to
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
schedule those in now so we can do all
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
the prep work to make sure that we can
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
be responsive to your questions and get
 
00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
those answered
 
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
um so with that I will hand it over to
 
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
thanks Nathan
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
so as Nathan said I I will talk about my
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
roadmap as I shared with you um I think
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
it was a couple weeks ago I do have some
 
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
more detail on that as promised from the
 
00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
last time but just starting out for from
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
the beginning obviously we have our
 
00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.830 align:start position:0%
the beginning obviously we have our
mission

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
mission
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
um of the department breaking out in
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
terms of some basic functions and the
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
responsibility slide is really when you
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
think about the department it's large
 
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
budget and all of the responsibilities
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
that it has we break it down into the
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
four areas of Education delivering
 
00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
services to clients protecting the
 
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
health and safety of our citizens and
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
Regulatory oversight so there's a little
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
bit of example under each of those of
 
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
what that looks like that's probably the
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
most succinct way to break down what we
 
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start position:0%
do I could probably sit here for hours
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
and tell you everything about the
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
department but at that high level that's
 
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
what our focus is the page after that
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
the slide after that is our
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
organizational our current
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
organizational chart for the office of
 
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
the commissioner as you can imagine we
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
have multiple organs organizational
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
charts so if you were to look at the
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
division of program integrity and
 
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
quality that would then break down into
 
00:08:04.089 --> 00:08:04.099 align:start position:0%
its own
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
organizational chart and I will share
 
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
with you that all of these are on our
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
internet so should you be curious to see
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
how something else breaks down you can
 
00:08:15.529 --> 00:08:15.539 align:start position:0%
just go into our website
 
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
and get that level of detail providing
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
this level of Office of the commissioner
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
for this presentation that we're doing
 
00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:24.539 align:start position:0%
with you today so that you get an
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
understanding of how we sort of break
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
out our more administrative operations
 
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
which is on the left side and then on
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
the right side you'll see most of our
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
policy areas and there are some
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
administrative areas underneath as well
 
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
such as the financial and the legal
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
sections may I ask a question about this
 
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
wire diagram I I I know that this is the
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
first budget that we're under the office
 
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner there is the
 
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
established the prescription drug
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
affordability board and I think it's
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
under your legal and Regulatory could
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
could you just point out where they
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
all the way down to the bottom right you
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
'll see the chief legal officer right
 
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
underneath that is Licensing and
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
Regulatory services so it would be under
 
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
that org chart there
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
where it says Doreen Shockley thank you
 
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair question uh representative Hill
 
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
um so in this organization chart right
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
ripsum is in charge of dcyf but my
 
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is above and beyond the
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
staff that directly report to him right
 
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
there's other staff within the
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
department some are which under the
 
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner itself in terms of like
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
Legal Services other things beyond the
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
legal services department is there
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
could you clarify anything else that
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
reports to Joe no no that works on dcyf
 
00:09:59.810 --> 00:09:59.820 align:start position:0%
stuff that is within right that is not
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
underneath him directly I know like I
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
know the legal department right from one
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
of the orphan charts I saw along the way
 
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
reports up through the office of
 
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.509 align:start position:0%
reports up through the office of
commissioner

00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:08.519 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this chart here if you
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
were to go to the left and you'll see
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's program quality HR
 
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
Communications Information Systems
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
facilities all of those support every
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
single box on the right and then if you
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
go further if you go down you'll see our
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
chief medical officer as well as our
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
Nathan our Chief Financial Officer our
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
chief legal officer finance and
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
procurement those also support all of
 
00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
so in terms of looking forward in
 
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.170 align:start position:0%
so in terms of looking forward in
priorities

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I think as I've mentioned I'm interim
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
commissioner that I know of for at least
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
a year so perceived until apprehended
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
and this is my plan my focus is the
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
roadmap so looking at four commitments
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
I've been socializing I socialized with
 
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
with you a couple of weeks ago I've been
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
out and about to various groups
 
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
including our staff to socialize that
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
with them as well if you if you go to
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
slide six this is sort of the the
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
bubbles are the summary of the four
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
commitment areas which pretty much break
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
down to Workforce managing our time our
 
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
resources effectively and organizational
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
value which is pretty much return on
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
investment and promoting thriving
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
communities is really working in a lot
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
of our service delivery areas so at the
 
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
time that I met with you I if you go to
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
the next slide I had talked about four
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
commitments the four commitments break
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
down into 11 initiatives high level
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
actions that will lead to goal schools
 
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
so we have 11 initiatives that have 28
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
goals and I counted this morning 97
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.509 align:start position:0%
goals and I counted this morning 97
deliverables

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
deliverables
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
as of this point in time so that is
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
going to be our Focus from February to
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
February and with an evaluation process
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
that is ongoing with dashboards and
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
measurements as well I could talk a
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
little bit about the commitments a
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
little bit more starting on slide slide
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
eight uh no surprise to anybody that
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce is an issue it's an issue for
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
a lot of our providers in the community
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's an issue for the Department as
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
you've probably seen with our vacancy
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
rate even though we have positions we
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
can't fill them if we do fill them
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
they're turning pretty quickly so
 
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
attrition is happening quicker than we
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
can fill so our Focus really is one to
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
build up the workforce and two to keep
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
the people that are there there and to
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
provide Career Development opportunities
 
00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:38.779 align:start position:0%
for people to stay in the department
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
Department's pretty large you look at
 
00:12:42.949 --> 00:12:42.959 align:start position:0%
that org chart you see different policy
 
00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
areas you could come in one policy area
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
grow and still have an opportunity to
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
apply in another policy area so it's a
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
pretty good place to work in terms of
 
00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
opportunities but on top of of you can
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
hire people you can get people to stay
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
but one of the key ways to get people to
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
stay is really focusing in on your
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
culture so when we think about
 
00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:04.260 align:start position:0%
psychological well-being we hear about
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
that a lot right we hear about
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
compassion fatigue we hear about our
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
First Responders we hear about people
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
you know those that that are doing the
 
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:13.740 align:start position:0%
caring being worn down and we also know
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
that our communities are dealing with a
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
lot of mental health issues so we're
 
00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
making an effort and a push in this next
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
year to really focus in on creating a
 
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
space that people feel valued their work
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
is recognized and their work is
 
00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
Meaningful right so the work that
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
they're doing is making a difference in
 
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
the lives of those that we serve that's
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
part of our mission so we're going to be
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
focusing in on that so when you look you
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
think about the initiatives we have
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
multiple goals in that area and
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
deliverables that will speak to that
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
can can I jump ahead a second
 
00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:45.850 align:start position:0%
can can I jump ahead a second
um

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:45.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
on the deliverables as I flip through
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
your slide deck I don't I don't see the
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
97 deliverables I I know that they're
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
probably somewhere
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
they're right here in my hand oh okay at
 
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
some point if you could you know
 
00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019 align:start position:0%
transmit that because as we hear folks
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
coming in uh to to brief after you what
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to do is is to take
 
00:14:12.769 --> 00:14:12.779 align:start position:0%
your strategies and map their budget
 
00:14:15.769 --> 00:14:15.779 align:start position:0%
requests just so I can get some
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
assurance that we're we're all lining up
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
that your strategies are being resourced
 
00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
and and and when the I.T guys come back
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be wanting them to map
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
their I.T efforts into your your
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
strategies as well and I don't I don't
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
know if you find that helpful but that's
 
00:14:35.329 --> 00:14:35.339 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the things I think
 
00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:38.459 align:start position:0%
we want to try to do is align the all of
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
our efforts absolutely I mean I think
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
this morning at fiscal one of the items
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
approved from Das was on Recruitment and
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
getting new tools so that's actually one
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
of my deliverables is to be able to have
 
00:14:52.129 --> 00:14:52.139 align:start position:0%
access to those tools to make some of
 
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
the changes here so it is a lot that
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
that is an example of it lining up
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
Nathan will make sure that we get that
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
to you it's going to be posted on our
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
intranet and intranet my point being is
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
that we want to share it with whoever's
 
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:05.220 align:start position:0%
interested in reading it so absolutely
 
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
and to anticipate one of the standard
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
questions if we could have it in an
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
Excel form I don't know what what the
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
underlying document is but if we could
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
have a soft copy of it and not just a
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
um if I'm okay to move to Commitment too
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
uh so commitment two is promoting
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
thriving communities
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
um so when we you know people say well
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
what is that how do you break that down
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
it's really looking at
 
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
um Equitable care Equitable access
 
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
increasing access modernizing improving
 
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of our systems so this isn't
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily new work this is lifting
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
that work up and bringing some
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
intentionality with how these things
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
work together so it's an alignment of
 
00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
systems of delivery which is which is in
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
line with a lot of the efficiencies that
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to gain with this so in terms
 
00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:04.139 align:start position:0%
of looking at what we do and having it
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
more integrated as well as Behavioral
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
Health Continuum we need to increase our
 
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Workforce we know that
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
that is an issue and we know that a lot
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the systems that we stand up it's
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
great but if we don't have the people to
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
run them then we don't have a system so
 
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
focusing in on that things like critical
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
time and intervention you may or may not
 
00:16:24.829 --> 00:16:24.839 align:start position:0%
have heard that ways of trying to keep
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
people in communities rather than in
 
00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive settings if they don't need
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
to be and the juvenile justice system is
 
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
really you know that does include what's
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen in the future with our
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
with our Juvenile Facility but it's more
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
than that it's really about assessing
 
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:42.060 align:start position:0%
kids before they get into the criminal
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
justice system before they're getting
 
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
into the courts and seeing if we can
 
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
meet those needs in a community-based
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
way so we have what we call a cans
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
assessment a child an adolescent needs
 
00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
assessment our assessments have
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
increased significantly over the last
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
year kids are getting services and not
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily having to be placed in a
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
residential facility or Correctional
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
Facility I'd like to ask you a question
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
about that I I think that's a great
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
objective that we all share
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson has shared some data overviews
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
with us where he says that New Hampshire
 
00:17:18.289 --> 00:17:18.299 align:start position:0%
is depending on how you interpret the
 
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:19.980 align:start position:0%
statistic we're either number one or
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
number two in terms of the lowest per
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
capita incarceration
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
of Youth and you know let's assume that
 
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:30.740 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
with that it seems to imply is our
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
ability to reduce the head count
 
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
further is is going to be challenged and
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
not that we shouldn't keep making
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
efforts to reduce it but what what is
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
your sense on
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
um what he's offered in testimony that
 
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
we we
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
probably have to realize that there is
 
00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.820 align:start position:0%
some natural number
 
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
where we just can't get below that in
 
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
terms of managing Public Safety and and
 
00:18:07.549 --> 00:18:07.559 align:start position:0%
and and taking care of these kids too
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
sure and I don't I don't want to debate
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
the number with you there's there's
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that go back and forth I think
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've gotten it low I think if we can
 
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
keep more kids in community we will but
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
could we go as low as six I don't know
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
if we could ever really say that when we
 
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
look at our census and we look at the
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
laws that have changed and the kids that
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
are going there
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
um I think the number that we've a lot
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
of people have landed on is around 12 12
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
to 18 seems to be the number but I don't
 
00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
really think it's 18 I think it's
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
probably hovering right between 12 and
 
00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:40.700 align:start position:0%
15 but that could change with anything
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
right I mean if kids aren't getting what
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
they need that number could go up
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
so it's I agree with what Joe is saying
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
this is uh pretty much our return on our
 
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
investment so uh we had a an executive
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
order and I think it was back in it was
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
right prior to the pandemic that
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
basically was asking us to stay or
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
directing us to stand up a division that
 
00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
would really look at program quality and
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
integrity covet hit we we have we had
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure up we had some of
 
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:23.940 align:start position:0%
the positions but wasn't fully developed
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
it is my intention to get that fully
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
developed to basically have a framework
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
for quality and Performance Management
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
across all of those policy areas so
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
something that's a little bit more
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
standardized I know marathellius was
 
00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:36.059 align:start position:0%
here talking with you a little bit about
 
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
that as well so that is we will be a
 
00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
huge Focus for us as well as our
 
00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
contract lifecycle management so that's
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
really the key word there is life cycle
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
so it really starts at the conception of
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
an idea for a service which which you
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
know involves the people that are going
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
to be bidding on the server so right so
 
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
people that are people that are doing
 
00:19:58.250 --> 00:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
the work coming together in terms terms
 
00:19:59.870 --> 00:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
of talking about what the need in the
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
community is so that we're writing
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
procurements appropriately and correctly
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
where having contracts that hit the mark
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
and that we're constantly monitoring
 
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
them and at the end of the day that
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
contract Service did made the difference
 
00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:16.980 align:start position:0%
that it was supposed to was a service
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
that was provided so yeah I mean those
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
are things that you say we probably
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
should be doing absolutely I don't have
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
enough staff right now to continually do
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
that but it is a need so this division
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
will help Propel that for the policy
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
areas work with the policy areas where I
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
say policy areas that's divisions we
 
00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
have seven major divisions as well as
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
provide that technical assistance for
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
folks so that we can get to a spot of
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure I'm mapping your
 
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
words here into what I understand in the
 
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
organization this is where uh Meredith
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
tell us or tell us okay
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
um are you I assume you you're familiar
 
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
but I hate making assumptions with the
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
conversations I've been having with her
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
for the last two or three years where
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
um I I think under the previous
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
commissioner she had intended to to
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
really do what you're doing now is is
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
making this Quality Function
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
um vital to being able to produce good
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
metrics so that we know what resources
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
to put in and whether or not those
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
resources are being effective those are
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
kind of two different issues but that
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic threw everything off so so
 
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
what I've been saying to to Meredith is
 
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.890 align:start position:0%
what I've been saying to to Meredith is
that

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I I support I think on on basically a
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
10-year program and we're in kind of
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
year three is from my viewpoint of of
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
developing that into a very robust
 
00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
capability so that uh Future Finance
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
committees when they're trying to figure
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
out how much resource we should invest
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
in your system we've got we've got
 
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:04.740 align:start position:0%
really nice work workload metrics to
 
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
look at and then when we ask the next
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
question is these resources we're
 
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
putting in are we getting out of this
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
what the quality the results that we
 
00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
want and have those metrics my
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is the state of of your
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
department now is that you you you are
 
00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:24.539 align:start position:0%
doing a pretty solid job on the contract
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
side but internal to the department
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
that there's still a lot of work that
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
that you see that could be done still to
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
develop those kind of metrics is is that
 
00:22:39.649 --> 00:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
yes one is that a fair assessment of
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
your of your
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
status of the maturity of this and and
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
and and two
 
00:22:46.919 --> 00:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
and and two
um

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
would you
 
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.789 align:start position:0%
would you
um

00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
do you share sort of that long-term View
 
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
yes I I don't
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
know it on are we in year two or year
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
three of a 10-year plan but you we are
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
trying to build that infrastructure now
 
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
so that we can have those things
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
consistently across all pop program
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
areas right so I would agree with you we
 
00:23:11.149 --> 00:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
have it uh We've
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
done a great job with the procurement
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
process but it's that life cycle
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
management piece of it right we've got
 
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
the front end we need the rest of it we
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
do it well in Pockets we need to do it
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
well everywhere
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
okay so when that part of the budget
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
comes in we're obviously looking at the
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
next two years but if I had some sense
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
of where you see this rolling out to
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
year 10 whether we're in year two or
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
three now I I don't much care but if if
 
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:40.740 align:start position:0%
we could just see sort of your long-term
 
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:43.559 align:start position:0%
road map to to get to where you really
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
want to be because I don't think you're
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
going to get to where you want to be in
 
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:50.700 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle are you no I I would
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
that'd be great but no I don't I don't
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
think so all right thanks yeah I think
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
we'll see the return on that probably
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
the fourth commitment
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
um there's a little bit about kind of
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
ties in what we were just talking about
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
is really if we have limited uh
 
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
resources which we do and high demand
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
how do we manage that effectively so
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
really one of the things I'm working on
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh we're ready to roll is a project
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
governance structure which allows the
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
senior leadership in the department to
 
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
look at the priorities and and align our
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
strategies and resources with those
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
priorities pretty intentionally
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and part of that is our best project
 
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
management best practices which we've
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
have implemented some new tools over the
 
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
last year and it's actually the return
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
on that investment has been pretty good
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
we know that what we have for tools and
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
processes work for that so we're going
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
to blast that department-wide the the
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
third bullet here is really again
 
00:24:54.049 --> 00:24:54.059 align:start position:0%
knowing that we have staff shortages and
 
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:55.860 align:start position:0%
knowing that part of the work that we do
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
is 24 7 facilities as you can imagine
 
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're short staffed not only clinically
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
but also what we call Environmental
 
00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
Services all of the support services in
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
a facility really intentionally aligning
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
some of those resources to improve
 
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:13.980 align:start position:0%
operational efficiencies
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
took a question here
 
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:19.980 align:start position:0%
um Am I Wrong to think that for now at
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
least the um
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
the secure forensic facility is should
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
you should be listed in as one of these
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
items or or is it just embedded already
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire hospital
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
it's currently not I mean obviously we
 
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
know it's not built yet so we don't
 
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:40.980 align:start position:0%
exactly have we're not that point yet it
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
will be but this is if we're looking at
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
12 months which is what my roadmap is
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
sort of that time frame I think you
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
would see that after that okay so I I
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
think you've actually tweaked my
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
thinking about it I I thought that what
 
00:25:59.049 --> 00:25:59.059 align:start position:0%
exists and operates now in the prison
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
within that bubble area of the prison is
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is the secure forensic unit now
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
doc no no so the forensic hospital that
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of getting ready
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
to put out for the forbid for the
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
architect for the construction that that
 
00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
will be attached to New Hampshire
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
just a quick one but um program that's
 
00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:31.490 align:start position:0%
just a quick one but um program that's
now

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
um yes and I can call I've asked for
 
00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:40.200 align:start position:0%
that to be called out actually no that's
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry so Hampstead Hospital and
 
00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility that's
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
one uh that's their new that's their new
 
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
acronym hhrtf the path program should be
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
in here and it's not it's a mistake
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
oversight that it's not in here great
 
00:26:54.649 --> 00:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you I've been saying all week when
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
I've been presenting this and paths
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
should be included in here and I thought
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
I thought the edit was made and it
 
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.529 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:08.529 --> 00:27:08.539 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:11.700 align:start position:0%
so those are those are the commitments
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
those are the focus and I I those should
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
be lining up with as you were indicating
 
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:18.900 align:start position:0%
you know as groups come through I think
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
you'll find our our different program
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
areas who are part of developing this
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
you will find alignment in many of those
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
can I go back and ask you about culture
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
I I I want to make an assumption about
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
objectives for maintaining and improving
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
the culture of the department
 
00:27:42.179 --> 00:27:43.130 align:start position:0%
the culture of the department
um

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
that as as we're building it and as
 
00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
you're continuing to support your vision
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
for everyone uh I I assume you've got a
 
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.669 align:start position:0%
for everyone uh I I assume you've got a
very

00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
patient or client-centric view that the
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
Department's purpose is to send to to
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
support that end point those those
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
people who live throughout the state and
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
that it's vital to helping those people
 
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
to have a strong provider Network that
 
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily that doesn't for the
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
most part report to you at all but still
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're part of uh this the total system
 
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
and you're although you're stuck with
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
some informal responsibility there it
 
00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
still seems to be the Department's
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to have the whole
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
department view that extended system as
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
part of what's important to you
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah our Pro I mean are you
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
honing in on provider
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
well I I I'm just I just want to make
 
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:49.320 align:start position:0%
sure as we're going through the budget
 
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
that we're prioritizing monies that help
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
people who directly touch patients that
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
that there are priorities might
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
certainly my priority because that's the
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
most direct way to ensure that patients
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
and clients are getting the services so
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very biased I think towards
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
wanting to support everything that's
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a direct care item
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
sure so so if we go back to the org
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
chart just for a second I would my
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
response to that would be I agree with
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
you I mean everything that we do is for
 
00:29:24.169 --> 00:29:24.179 align:start position:0%
those that we serve knowing that
 
00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
probably 50 is going to of this of the
 
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
population or the workforce is going to
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
be directly involved with that then we
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
have all of these administrative
 
00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:36.299 align:start position:0%
operation areas that we that you asked
 
00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:37.310 align:start position:0%
operation areas that we that you asked
about

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
um those if we don't have you know the
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
the funding in those areas obviously we
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
can't do the work on the front end so
 
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's the back end there's the front
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
end and then the provider end yeah I
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
mean we really don't have you know a lot
 
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
of a lot of what we do is is earmarked
 
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
for that population but sometimes it may
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
not come across that way at the end of
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
the day right when you get to the very
 
00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
end it is about those those that are
 
00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
receiving their service even though it
 
00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
you know I assumed we were aligned but I
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
just I hate making assumptions on
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
um and and you have mentioned that you
 
00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
you do have a requirement or you see the
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
requirement to rebuild a culture that's
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
been hit by remote work and and the like
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of attrition so as long as
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on the elements of the
 
00:30:30.289 --> 00:30:30.299 align:start position:0%
Health Care system that don't operate
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
inside the formal structure of DHHS
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
alone I I think that's the place we want
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
to be for the state
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean we can't do it without
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
our providers right there's only so much
 
00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
that we can do so it's internal and and
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
external all right thank you we'll pick
 
00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
up where you want to on this
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
one I'm going to hand it off to Nathan
 
00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you if you turn to slide 12
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a very high level overview of
 
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:03.740 align:start position:0%
the Department's State fiscal year 2425
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
Governor's recommended budget there
 
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
um we've we've talked about this
 
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.240 align:start position:0%
previously in in some of our prior
 
00:31:12.409 --> 00:31:12.419 align:start position:0%
conversations but as you'll see our
 
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
department we're approximately 49
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
federally funded that is a vast majority
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
of the funds that we do receive about 31
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
percent are General funds and the
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
remaining 20 is other funds and
 
00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to the other funds we
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
will be I'll actually be talking about a
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
couple of those today and then next week
 
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
in the subsequent week we'll really dig
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
into some of the details of what those
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
other funds represent because in each
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
division area they're going to represent
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
something very very different
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on slide 12
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.149 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:31:54.769 --> 00:31:54.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
um you've given us excuse me you've
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
given us numbers for 2024 and 2025. do
 
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
you know what for as a benchmark was
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
this year for those three sure
 
00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
so for State fiscal year 2022 we were
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
approximately 2.8 billion dollars for
 
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year for the current state
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2023 we're approximately 2.9
 
00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
of course and I'm going to talk about
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
some of those cost drivers here in the
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
coming slides
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
so you you weren't here last budget
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
cycle but one of the things that Mr
 
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
Ripple worked out with your predecessor
 
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.090 align:start position:0%
Ripple worked out with your predecessor
was

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
um as we looked at numbers we we added a
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
couple extra columns to the left hand
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
side of the spreadsheet so that we had a
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
six or eight year trending of the
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
numbers and to representative Hall's
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
implied Point here is just seeing what
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
you're projecting for the next two years
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't give us the context that the the
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
the the deeper materials will
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but we'll we'll be getting to that
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
of course yeah and again the attention
 
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
of this slide wasn't necessarily for
 
00:33:09.289 --> 00:33:09.299 align:start position:0%
comparative purposes but more of a high
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
level overview
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and and the subsequent slides will
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
have that that prior actual adjusted
 
00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
authorized figure available
 
00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:18.950 align:start position:0%
authorized figure available
um

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
slide 13 of the the purpose of this is
 
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
is I wanted again I'm really thinking
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
about starting everybody off at kind of
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
the 30 000 foot View today what I wanted
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
to do was just kind of highlight where
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
the positions are within DHHS and
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
starting on the left you'll see the
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and families
 
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of direct care service
 
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.029 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of direct care service
providers

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and and HHS employees providing those
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
Direct Services and that's part of the
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
reason why you have a higher number of
 
00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:51.860 align:start position:0%
personnel there we did abolish 50
 
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
positions uh and from that division this
 
00:33:59.630 --> 00:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
past through this process and those were
 
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
primarily at the SUNY New Youth Services
 
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:04.140 align:start position:0%
Center we've seen a reduction in census
 
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
and those positions weren't going to be
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
filled so we reduced those given the
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
current census levels
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
the next um
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
if you shift to the right you'll see
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital and residential
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
treatment facility the positions that
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
are represented there those are six new
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions for for this
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
budget they were approved
 
00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
um through this past uh legislative
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
session and process
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
um but those are new we also have
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
approximately 21 classified employees as
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
well that we will be seeking to convert
 
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:40.740 align:start position:0%
to full-time authorized positions
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
currently they're full-time temporary
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
positions and that was that was more of
 
00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
a result of the state acquiring a
 
00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
facility Midstream and converting some
 
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720 align:start position:0%
of the some of the existing positions
 
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
that hand some existing Personnel at
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
Hampstead into the state system to
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
ensure that we have the operations staff
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
on site
 
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:02.460 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability this
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
is an area I think Bureau of family
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
um excuse me
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
um this is an area where we also do have
 
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:12.780 align:start position:0%
some Direct Care Providers these are the
 
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
individuals that are conducting
 
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh determinations and
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
processing and answering questions for
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
individuals that that are seeking SNAP
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
benefits or other benefits as well that
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
is certainly a large function there the
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services well it's
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's relatively small on the FTE front
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
you will see from a budgetary
 
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
perspective this is the team that
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
handles the the MCO contracts uh so you
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
know even though it's only 32 positions
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's actually handling a a significant
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
chunk of dhhs's budget
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about this in a little
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
bit this is an area where we have 72
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
accounts so we have a lot of federal
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
grants with each Federal grant we often
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
have a separate accounting unit and many
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
of these individuals here they manage
 
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
those Federal Awards on an ongoing basis
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
the division for Behavioral Health
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
approximately 58 positions there the
 
00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner and
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative you I'll talk about this
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit more in detail just about
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
what the support looks like it's
 
00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:18.980 align:start position:0%
approximately 544 authorized positions
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home 24-hour facility there's
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
169 positions there 695 at New Hampshire
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
hospital another 24-hour facility as
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
well and then the division of long-term
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
supports and services yes representative
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
Edwards do you have a question I do and
 
00:36:36.589 --> 00:36:36.599 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to get to this right
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
regarding the office of the commissioner
 
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
in the 544 listed here I'm looking at
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
the a different org chart that was
 
00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
provided by Mr Ripple
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't sync up to the exact number but
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's close right Office of the
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner probably from the prior
 
00:36:53.569 --> 00:36:53.579 align:start position:0%
year maybe it looks like the vast
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
majority of these Physicians are
 
00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:58.020 align:start position:0%
classified right meaning hourly workers
 
00:37:00.829 --> 00:37:00.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure why we would have such
 
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
a large group that is typically
 
00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
full-time staff that are what I would
 
00:37:06.359 --> 00:37:07.670 align:start position:0%
full-time staff that are what I would
consider

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:37:10.609 --> 00:37:10.619 align:start position:0%
to use the colloquialism white collar
 
00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
workers right that would be office
 
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
manage office staff in a typical
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
organization that would be hourly as
 
00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
opposed to more traditional salaried
 
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.970 align:start position:0%
opposed to more traditional salaried
people

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
so so your question is why are they out
 
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
yeah why why why such a large percentage
 
00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
yeah why why why such a large percentage
of

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
right administrative
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
oversight type help that is there all
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
the time very consistent jobs as opposed
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
to Direct Care being in fielded workers
 
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
where hourly might make more sense well
 
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
they're both our own
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure I'm understanding your
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
question so I would see that the admit
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
the department that's helping out the
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that has the same
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
workflow in and out all the time right
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
where those would be hourly over salary
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make sense to me
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
from the traditional business corporate
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
model right those are positions that
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
have very similar jobs day in and day
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
out you can plan weeks in advance what
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
the workload is going to be which is
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
different than let's say the case
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
manager who suddenly gets an extra case
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
or has a case that takes an extra amount
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
of time right it's it's you can't plan
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
the caseworker workload as well as you
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
can the the support staff behind the
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
scenes sure I mean I think the bigger
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
picture is how we get positions right we
 
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
don't get we don't really get a choice
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
of would you prefer classified versus
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified I.E salary versus hourly
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
right we get a Workforce with positions
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
that we then structure into an
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
organization and we only have out of
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
that whole total number of positions 87
 
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:43.380 align:start position:0%
are unclassified and those are usually
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
your upper management positions but for
 
00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
HHS they're also cited in statute as
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
requirements for positions that we need
 
00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
to have so we don't have more than that
 
00:38:59.450 --> 00:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
and to make an ask for that that is a
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
legislative ask or another change to
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
establish something so and most of those
 
00:39:04.849 --> 00:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
positions are represented right so
 
00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
they're covered uh with by Union as well
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
whereas unclassified aren't okay so we
 
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
just don't have a lot of flexibility or
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
Choice with that I guess what I'm saying
 
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up so so
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
in the perfect world I'm gonna live in
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
the perfect world but in the perfect
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
world would it make sense to have a
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
greater a greater percentage as
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
salaried staff versus right versus
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
hourly for some of those jobs
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
no I mean you would take some of the
 
00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
front-facing staff to encase management
 
00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
and one would say look at their overtime
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
and look at their comp time and would it
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
make more sense that they're salaried
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
and not hourly
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
caseworkers are in a different rate it's
 
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:47.940 align:start position:0%
hard to predict what the case load is
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
going to be week to week but I'm
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
thinking the support staff whether it's
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
the I.T side there's a bunch of other
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
things that are going on behind the
 
00:39:56.329 --> 00:39:56.339 align:start position:0%
scenes and maybe it's just having spent
 
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
so many years in the corporate world
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
I I right the people on the on the line
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are making the widgets right those
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
are the people that you might have an
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
extra order in so you need to have
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
people there and they need to work
 
00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
overtime I get it and that's equivalent
 
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the caseworkers but some of the
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
administrative staff tend to be more
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes and very consistent
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
week to week work world-wise
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
so I I and we'll we'll talk about this
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
next week but
 
00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
um what sometimes should be consistent
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
is not consistent at all because we get
 
00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know if it's on the legal side we
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
may get right to know requests we may
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
have a case prop up if it's on the I.T
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
side there may be an emergency if a
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
system is down there's generally
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
speaking it it I I don't know if I would
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
necessarily qualify a lot of that as
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
regular work okay
 
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Waller did you have a
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
answer but
 
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.930 align:start position:0%
answer but
um

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
instead of the Hands-On work where a lot
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
of the Hands-On were done by the
 
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
department is done by contracts with
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
contract agencies do we have any idea of
 
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
how many employees are out there working
 
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.410 align:start position:0%
how many employees are out there working
with

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Service clients but out
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
in the community through a contract this
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I think that would be a difficult
 
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:20.220 align:start position:0%
figure to come up with we we create a
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
separate budget for every contractor
 
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:24.420 align:start position:0%
that we have and when they submit their
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
invoices they have to submit supporting
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
documentation that attributes the cost
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
that they're requesting reimbursement
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
for to to whatever whatever they spent
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
um generally some of our contracts we
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
can see this is one position this is two
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
positions uh you know our psychiatric
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
contract at New Hampshire hospital we
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
can see how many uh psychiatrists you
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
know we have on staff so in those cases
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
it's a little clearer in some of our
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
other instances where we may pay on
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
deliverable or something along those
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
lines that's going to make it a little
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
bit more complicated so you may be able
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
to come up with that but probably not
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
short of several hundred hours of
 
00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.050 align:start position:0%
short of several hundred hours of
analysis

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
please don't waste your time doing that
 
00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
could I follow up
 
00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:09.230 align:start position:0%
could I follow up
um

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
so do we have in our Contracting with
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
all of these outside agencies do we have
 
00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.930 align:start position:0%
all of these outside agencies do we have
requirements

00:42:17.930 --> 00:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
um around their pay scales around the
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
benefits provided to their employees are
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
they required to have something
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
I currently no we we do not so when we
 
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
go out to bid whether it's a request for
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
proposals or requests for bid or a
 
00:42:42.589 --> 00:42:42.599 align:start position:0%
request for applications we don't
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily specify the amount that that
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
contractor that organization needs to
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
pay their staff sometimes if we do a
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
request for proposal we'll evaluate both
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
the technical component and the cost
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
component and through that cost
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
component analysis we will see what's
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
the you know what's the cost per nurse
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
or something along those lines but
 
00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
there's not necessarily a requirement
 
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
that if they budget at that cost that
 
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
that nurse is paid at the level that
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
they had proposed
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
um necessarily there you know there's no
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham yeah do you
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a I think you mentioned 400 major
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
contractors that we work with was that
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
approximately correct number so
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the numbers that were provided last
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
time had separated them into kind of two
 
00:43:34.849 --> 00:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
distinct categories
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
um I believe there was roughly over 200
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
contractors that are providing Direct
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
Services to the department and the 400
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
number were the contractors to your
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
point that were providing services on
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
and and Dewey is a list of all of those
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
provided at some point I can certainly
 
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
provide a list okay absolutely thank you
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
may I just add something to to your
 
00:43:59.030 --> 00:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
question I was just sort of roughly
 
00:44:01.849 --> 00:44:01.859 align:start position:0%
adding up in my scratch math here of how
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
many in the department you know we're
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
probably just shy of the 2000 positions
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
when we take all of our 24 7 facilities
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
but then we take all of our case workers
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
which we consider direct care right so
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
so a more than half of our staff are
 
00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:21.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
so while we're still on slide 13 here I
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
I look at this slide totally differently
 
00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:31.079 align:start position:0%
than most people I look at this and I
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
try to listen back to what I've heard
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
the I.T folks talking about about how
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
leveraging it can help us with the
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
productivity gains and to somebody like
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
me when I hear productivity gains I'm
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
hearing can can we reduce Manpower while
 
00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
still doing the job so as I look at this
 
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm I wonder
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
which of these towers are most likely to
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
be influenced by good I.T implementation
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
to either make it more productive or at
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
some point give us some bandwidth to to
 
00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
relook Manpower allocation
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
Office of the commissioner
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
Office of the commissioner when we look
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
at everything that's in there right we
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
let's just take requests a right to know
 
00:45:22.849 --> 00:45:22.859 align:start position:0%
requests right we know that technology
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
can help us streamline in that process
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
and and get that information out quicker
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot of your
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
administrative operational areas that
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
are going to utilize the technology I
 
00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
mean to my point there's 1900 staff
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
providing Direct Care there is
 
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
efficiencies with case management
 
00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:41.339 align:start position:0%
technology but in terms of the work that
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
we did this past spring looking at what
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
technology can bring efficiencies where
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
we're short staffed a lot of it was in
 
00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
our operational areas administrative
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
operational areas
 
00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:55.140 align:start position:0%
so so that sounds like if when the it
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
folks come in they'll be talking about
 
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
what they're doing to try to streamline
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
the 91a process or those kinds of things
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
so that what you're saying and and what
 
00:46:08.089 --> 00:46:08.099 align:start position:0%
they're doing to help you you're it's
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
all aligned
 
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
yes it should be I mean you know made a
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
request for for money to be able to do
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
some of that that doesn't mean we got it
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
so we are doing some of that but it's
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
important that we have the technology to
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
do that so it they will be speaking to
 
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380 align:start position:0%
that asks of that yes all right thank
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Earth thank you Mr
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
chair this more request than a question
 
00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
related to this chart could you also
 
00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
provide the temp full-time breakdown and
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
the part time breakdown and also how
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
so all of the positions here are I
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
believe are are funded I I will verify
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
that and get those other numbers for you
 
00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
okay so something other than a one
 
00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:55.370 align:start position:0%
okay so something other than a one
dollar

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.450 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:01.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative's question got me
 
00:47:03.359 --> 00:47:04.910 align:start position:0%
representative's question got me
thinking

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
I I tend to think of our Manpower in
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
five buckets
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
um full-time part-time
 
00:47:12.839 --> 00:47:13.790 align:start position:0%
um full-time part-time
um

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.089 --> 00:47:17.099 align:start position:0%
temporary permanent that's sort of four
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
of the categories depending on how you
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
associate them and then the fifth bucket
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
are contractors
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
and my right to interpret this is really
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
just being the the permanent full-time
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
or is this permanent and temporary
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
full-time and and do and and to
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
represent a verse question do we need
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
um a a broader lay down so we see better
 
00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:47.339 align:start position:0%
how the Manpower is allocated so this is
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
the total authorized full-time positions
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
that you'll see in the governor's
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
recommended budget at the bottom of each
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
agency section or even at the bottom of
 
00:47:58.250 --> 00:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
each account you'll see the the position
 
00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
count and that's what this represents
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
and this represents the classified and
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions that have been
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
authorized within the budget the
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time and temporary
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%
part-time those are typically what
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the governor's recommended
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
budget those are typically represented
 
00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:19.859 align:start position:0%
within class 50 and class 59 that's
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
where those typically would show up I
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
can talk to the data team to figure out
 
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
how we could do some sort of
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
visualization of that just for the
 
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee's purposes
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do you do you
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
have a follow-up there
 
00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
no that'd be great I mean really I
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
understand it's a snapshot because
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
you're part-time and temporary full-time
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
are definitely shifting around but I
 
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
just like to have some some sense of how
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
they break down of course
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham do you have a
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah so I I thought I
 
00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.829 align:start position:0%
question yeah so I I thought I
understood

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
understood
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
um you know the last presentation it's
 
00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
not inconsistent with anything you said
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
now but
 
00:48:58.849 --> 00:48:58.859 align:start position:0%
um you know if you look at uh you know
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
managing the services you provide if you
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
compare us to other small states uh
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
where you know hiring people and having
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
them be your direct temp or or full-time
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh people is a much bigger percentage of
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
the spend uh and
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
um then
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
um then contract Contracting if you
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
could you know we generally are
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
Contracting a much higher percentage of
 
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
our budget and our services and the
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services then then all
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
of the comparative states that we looked
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
at and if that's correct then you know
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
when we're we're looking at uh
 
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:38.579 align:start position:0%
you know trying to generate efficiency
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
we have to be looking at both sides of
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
those things not just employees direct
 
00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.990 align:start position:0%
those things not just employees direct
employees

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess first is did I hear you
 
00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:49.980 align:start position:0%
correctly on that with those two charts
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
that you created and is that a
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable conclusion the the charts
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
from the last presentation
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so so the the charts from the last
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
presentation those were pulled from the
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
consultant report and I can certainly
 
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
provide a link to everybody if if you'd
 
00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
like to take a closer look at that and
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
when they were looking at
 
00:50:09.530 --> 00:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
um our Department of Health and Human
 
00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
Services as a whole they they were
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
finding that we were a little bit more
 
00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.390 align:start position:0%
finding that we were a little bit more
lean

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
lean
 
00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but but when we when we start to go
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
through some of our accounts in detail
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
you'll see that some of our Contracting
 
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.250 align:start position:0%
you'll see that some of our Contracting
lines

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
um or our class 70 class 74 grants or
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
our 102 our Contracting line you will
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
see that those numbers will often be
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
much larger than some of our Personnel
 
00:50:31.859 --> 00:50:37.970 align:start position:0%
much larger than some of our Personnel
costs

00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
um yeah so if I think I remember like we
 
00:50:44.809 --> 00:50:44.819 align:start position:0%
often are spending 450 000 per employee
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
and some states were half of that level
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
but the con but it's heavily loaded
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
contractor just like you said rather
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
than salaries yes I can't recall those
 
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:55.980 align:start position:0%
numbers off top of my head but roughly
 
00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:59.930 align:start position:0%
numbers off top of my head but roughly
yes

00:50:59.930 --> 00:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
I I just want to clarify that that
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
comparison was for States that had
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
similar Medicaid populations that we did
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
I I think I think we beat 13 to depth
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
are you ready to go all right on to 14.
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
um so I I just based on the conversation
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we had last time um I took a look
 
00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
at the governor's recommended budget and
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
some of our position costs and I I just
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
threw in a couple of of high-level
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
numbers here um so we did have a net
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
reduction of 20 full-time authorized
 
00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.069 align:start position:0%
reduction of 20 full-time authorized
positions

00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
um I won't go in the details there
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
unless you want to hear them
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and and when I looked at our total
 
00:51:44.329 --> 00:51:44.339 align:start position:0%
budget our Personnel cost ratio for
 
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
total funds is about 10.5 percent of our
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
total budget and of our general fund uh
 
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:53.700 align:start position:0%
Personnel cost was about 5.2 percent
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
um we'd also discussed a little bit
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
about the DHHS so we're about 42 percent
 
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
of the budget and we represent the
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions not the
 
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:05.220 align:start position:0%
temporary part-time approximately 20 29
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
of all state positions
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
um just for kind of higher level context
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
if if you turn to slide 15
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
um this is the office of the
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
commissioner and beginning on Tuesday uh
 
00:52:21.170 --> 00:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
legal and finance will be presenting in
 
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:22.740 align:start position:0%
the morning well and in the afternoon
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have the office of Health Equity
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
um HR and others come in that day and
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
then later in the week on Friday we'll
 
00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:33.859 align:start position:0%
have facilities and it present as well
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's important to
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand that within the office of the
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner you know we do have our HR
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
our finance our procurement functions
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
our privacy our security our Medicaid
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
recoveries our Fraud Unit uh Meredith
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
toulouse's team is here as well
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
um but but it also includes Information
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
Services it also includes licensing and
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll be talking about this on
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday licensing for child care
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
licensing for Health Care Facilities so
 
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's not just kind of your traditional
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
administrative support
 
00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:11.700 align:start position:0%
um it includes quite a bit more than
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
that I don't know if there are any high
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
level questions on the office of the
 
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner before I move forward
 
00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:21.800 align:start position:0%
I do
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
the federal funds really seem to be
 
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:29.220 align:start position:0%
jumping big right is it seems like the
 
00:53:31.450 --> 00:53:31.460 align:start position:0%
federal government is trying to
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
downsize its Financial investment in the
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
States on on the health care basis
 
00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:40.500 align:start position:0%
so what what's going on there that's a a
 
00:53:42.589 --> 00:53:42.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like we're bringing in
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
more money because we're matching more
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
because the the dollars from 23 to 24
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
and general funds stays about the same
 
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
but yet the feds jump what what can you
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
explain that yeah there's a couple of
 
00:53:56.930 --> 00:53:56.940 align:start position:0%
things that are happening there off the
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
top of my head we had about a 1.3
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase in our federal
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
funds for our office of Health Equity
 
00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
for our Refugee population there's
 
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
roughly a six million dollar increase in
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
our class 27 line and Dave weeder is our
 
00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
director of Information Services we'll
 
00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
be talking about that on Friday
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
we also saw oh we also centralized our
 
00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:20.760 align:start position:0%
our sway cap and this is our Statewide
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
cost allocation plan so what that is is
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
Services charges each agency a certain
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
rate for General administrative costs
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
and you'll hear swycap which is it's not
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
intuitive acronym by any means but this
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
year we actually centralized that those
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
costs into ocom and a lot of those costs
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
are cost allocated so there's one
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
another kind of contributing factor for
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
why you're seeing that Federal fund
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know coming in just a second it
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is the opposite story
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
of what we were hearing two years ago
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
but it could just be my memory that that
 
00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that that that we we had gone
 
00:55:07.609 --> 00:55:07.619 align:start position:0%
through a period of transition in the
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
funds to where
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
um uh I I thought we had sort of
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
decentralized a lot of expenses to get
 
00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
it allocated better to the Departments
 
00:55:19.069 --> 00:55:19.079 align:start position:0%
and this sounds like uh if I'm
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
remembering that right this sounds like
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
a reversal where we're reconsolidating
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and before you answer I'm going to
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
let representative talk because he he
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
knows his stuff better than I do
 
00:55:34.569 --> 00:55:34.579 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
will you tell me if I if you know our
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
history on the decentralization and the
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
reconsolidation am I right on that or
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
not I don't know what trans
 
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:47.220 align:start position:0%
is it relative
 
00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.370 align:start position:0%
is it relative
well

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
relative to admin Services fees or are
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
internally to HHS the it was all an
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
accounting issue within DHHS where uh
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
that one of the complaints I remember
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
from two years ago was it was hard to go
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
measure a department year to year to
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
year because the the allocations of what
 
00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
went into the each account was changing
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
so you you never really had an apples to
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
Orange comparison and so so I just sort
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
of swallowed it thinking okay this is a
 
00:56:24.049 --> 00:56:24.059 align:start position:0%
period of transition and stability now
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
now it hears it sounds like maybe we're
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
still transitioning back and forth we're
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
in apples to oranges comparisons is
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
going to be there
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I didn't hear the prior discussions
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
but um this past summer when we were
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
putting our budget together I had made a
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
decision to centralize those costs in
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
one place just for that reason because I
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't clearly see across all of the
 
00:56:49.010 --> 00:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
different agencies how those costs were
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
being uh whether you know to be able to
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
see the trends that's part of the reason
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
hold on a second Mr rippler are you
 
00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
listening and paying attention I I want
 
00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot you know to to
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
correct my memory or or verify it you're
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
right we did have those conversations
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
last time but I think that's something
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
that tends to happen with HHS in every
 
00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
budget cycle there are always uh
 
00:57:18.710 --> 00:57:18.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies in terms of comparing
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
the budget from one division to another
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
division for example because there's
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of movement from year to
 
00:57:27.109 --> 00:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
year within that department
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
so it did happen last time but I'm
 
00:57:31.549 --> 00:57:31.559 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to continue
 
00:57:31.559 --> 00:57:32.809 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to continue
happening

00:57:32.809 --> 00:57:32.819 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
so it's going to happen next time too I
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
would guess so all right thanks
 
00:57:37.619 --> 00:57:39.349 align:start position:0%
would guess so all right thanks
representative

00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
this isn't my question but I
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
agree with what you just said that it
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
seems like we changed CFOs and they
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
change how to do the accounting because
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
the previous one was going the other way
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
going out into the
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
groups so that it's interesting that
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
we probably should find a stable system
 
00:57:59.450 --> 00:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
and like lock it down for the
 
00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:00.839 align:start position:0%
legislature regardless whether it's good
 
00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:03.540 align:start position:0%
or bad but as a quick question just on
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
this slide here regarding the general
 
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:08.700 align:start position:0%
funds what is the jump between the uh 22
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
actual and the 23 adjusted authorized
 
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
so if there were if there were contracts
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
that were encumbered but no funds were
 
00:58:19.609 --> 00:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
spent in that year that would be carry
 
00:58:22.250 --> 00:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
forward and so if there were delays in
 
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
certain projects just as a result of X Y
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
or Z that's where you'd see those costs
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
come come through
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
so if I average those out when I get an
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
idea what the budget numbers like they
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
would have been
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand what the
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
jump is if there is one from this but
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
this cycle to the next cycle
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:42.170 align:start position:0%
this cycle to the next cycle
sure

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I I would have to I'd have to take a
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
look at that can I take a shot at that
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
is is this is this just something as
 
00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
obvious as as uh 22 is measured actual
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
expense this is what you really spent
 
00:58:58.930 --> 00:58:58.940 align:start position:0%
but if we had put 22's adjusted
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
authorized instead of the actual I
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
assume that that number would be much
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
closer to the 23 authorized adjusted
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
authorized well the adjusted authorizes
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
normally just in the second year for
 
00:59:13.789 --> 00:59:13.799 align:start position:0%
those unspent funds that have been
 
00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
obligated towards something during the
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
biennium because then at the end of the
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
biennium all the general funds would
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
would lapse so so the the the reason
 
00:59:23.809 --> 00:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
that that I don't want to just say we
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
can take one and divide it by the other
 
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:27.420 align:start position:0%
is because if there were subsequent
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that were made if there
 
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
were fiscal items that that came forward
 
00:59:34.130 --> 00:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
before the fiscal committee that were
 
00:59:36.049 --> 00:59:36.059 align:start position:0%
accepted that were added into that
 
00:59:37.609 --> 00:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized that's the that's
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
the only reason why I hesitate there
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's great fiscal always tells us it's
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
never General funds
 
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:45.289 align:start position:0%
never General funds
yes

00:59:45.289 --> 00:59:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay excellent moving on to slide 16.
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh you have your Division of Medicaid
 
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
services in here in front of you uh just
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of things and I know everybody
 
00:59:57.770 --> 00:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
is probably aware of this the grant
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
Advantage Healthcare program is set to
 
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:03.540 align:start position:0%
expire in December 31 of 2023 there is
 
01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
currently legislation to address that
 
01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.630 align:start position:0%
currently legislation to address that
issue

01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
there is also the Medicaid unwind and
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
Henry Littman the director of the
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
division of Medicaid services will be
 
01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:15.980 align:start position:0%
coming here to speak with you on that
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
beginning April 1 the enhanced f-maps
 
01:00:21.049 --> 01:00:21.059 align:start position:0%
we've been able to receive an additional
 
01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:23.900 align:start position:0%
6.2 maps from the federal government
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
that will that will go away and then
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
we'll have five percent enhanced fmaps
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
for the end of June and then July
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
through September we'll have 2.5 percent
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
enhanced fmap and then uh for the last
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
for the subsequent quarter the second
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
quarter of State fiscal year 24 that's
 
01:00:43.849 --> 01:00:43.859 align:start position:0%
where we'll have the 1.5 percent
 
01:00:49.789 --> 01:00:49.799 align:start position:0%
now you what you're not seeing here is a
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
significant number or or one of the
 
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:54.180 align:start position:0%
larger increases that we have seen in
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Program and think regular
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid think chip uh children's health
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
insurance plan and then think expanded
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid or granted Advantage Health
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
Care Program you're not seeing the
 
01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage Healthcare program
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
figures here because that is in a trust
 
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:11.220 align:start position:0%
fund that that that you you won't see
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
within the governor's recommended budget
 
01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:18.420 align:start position:0%
um and and we receive a 90 10 a 90 match
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
from the federal government on that
 
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
um and and we do so in state fiscal year
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
23 just for everyone's awareness and we
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
are expecting about 590 million dollars
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
of expenditures but for 24 and 25 we
 
01:01:35.089 --> 01:01:35.099 align:start position:0%
expect that to drop
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
um to about 455 and 464 million so the
 
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:41.540 align:start position:0%
the expanded population
 
01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
are the most likely that will be
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
disenrolled uh beginning beginning in um
 
01:01:49.609 --> 01:01:49.619 align:start position:0%
in in the coming months and and that's
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
why you're going to see a significant
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
drop there but you're not necessarily
 
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:55.740 align:start position:0%
going to see an equivalent drop within
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
within the Medicaid budget that will
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.849 --> 01:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
so a couple questions one is a quick one
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
I hope the diff the drop from so this is
 
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:08.700 align:start position:0%
going the opposite direction now from
 
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
actual 22 to adjusted authorized 23 is
 
01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
actually going down pretty dramatically
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
in federal funds but even substantially
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
in general funds is that you can explain
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
and if not you can get back to us don't
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
don't think too hard yeah I let let me
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
analyze that a little bit I don't want
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
to speculate anyone give you any
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect information so a more general
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
question this is probably directed at
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
the for the commissioner
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
any reason you would be concerned with
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
putting the granite Advantage program or
 
01:02:43.490 --> 01:02:43.500 align:start position:0%
the expanded medicaid
 
01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
um onto the budget and maintain the
 
01:02:49.789 --> 01:02:49.799 align:start position:0%
existing flow of other funds if you will
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
I I can tell you
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
I know I would have to get back to you
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
on that question okay do you understand
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
how the funding works now
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
okay it's a whole different bunch of
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
streams outside of okay so I'm not
 
01:03:16.849 --> 01:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
suggesting changing that I'm just asking
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
if it was brought on budget so we could
 
01:03:21.890 --> 01:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
s do you see it I mean you don't see it
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
at all in our budget
 
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
no no you you you won't see that 90 10
 
01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:32.339 align:start position:0%
match you you did see uh aspects of that
 
01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal item this morning
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
um you know you you will see it through
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
those additional acceptance expense but
 
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if you could remind oh
 
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:48.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just wondered um if you
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
might remind us where the 10 our match
 
01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:03:59.210 --> 01:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh for that program
 
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.530 align:start position:0%
uh for that program
sure

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
um So currently there is a um
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
a portion of it comes through
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
um I'm drawing a blank on the name here
 
01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:12.059 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax pays for a
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
portion of it and then liquor funds are
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
also used to to pay for a portion of it
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
and for this particular biennium
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
um there there was a house bill 2
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
language to allow us to go if there was
 
01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
a shortfall particularly given the
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
increased populations because we have
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
not been able to disenroll individuals
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid in order to continue to
 
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
accept the enhanced fmap we have had to
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
go and use that that language to request
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
additional liquor funds in 22 we
 
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
requested an additional 8.7 million
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
dollars in liquor funds to cover the the
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
10 side in this current year we've
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
requested 7.2 million dollars based on
 
01:04:53.099 --> 01:04:57.549 align:start position:0%
requested 7.2 million dollars based on
projections

01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
you can pick up where you were of course
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
if you turn to slide 17 uh this is the
 
01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
division for children youth and Families
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
um you will see and and maybe I'll just
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
uh address this the you will see a
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
general fund increase there from one
 
01:05:16.130 --> 01:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
year to the next
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
um now now this is an area that is
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
Personnel we have more Personnel in this
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
area and we did have some supervisor and
 
01:05:26.809 --> 01:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
cpsw salary enhancements that were
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
approved by GNC this year in order to
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
make those positions competitive uh
 
01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
because we were having challenges uh
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
retaining and recruiting individuals
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that's part of what what you're
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
seeing there we also have had the
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
experience of hiring individuals at more
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
than step one so in the classified
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
system there's a scale step one two
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven eight nine
 
01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.789 align:start position:0%
three four five six seven eight nine
um

01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:49.799 --> 01:05:50.950 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
nine steps and we've we've often in
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
order to be competitive in order to hire
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
people we've had to hire them at step
 
01:05:59.809 --> 01:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
five or even step six or higher
 
01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes whereas when we budget we will
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
budget at step one
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and and that explains some of the
 
01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
fluctuations that you will see there
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
um we did we did have a prioritized need
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
that I don't necessarily anticipate will
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
be funded for the residential uh
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
residential provider rates we did
 
01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:22.799 align:start position:0%
convert to angio ribsum the director of
 
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
dcyf will be here in the coming weeks to
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
talk about this in a little bit more
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
detail we did convert to a new
 
01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
Contracting methodology and we have been
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
working with the with the residential
 
01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
treatment providers on those rates
 
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:37.730 align:start position:0%
treatment providers on those rates
um

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
and and those residential providers to
 
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:43.140 align:start position:0%
your earlier Point uh chairman of words
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
it they've had challenges hiring as well
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and this prioritized need uh was
 
01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
originally intended to help address
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
raise those rates so that the
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
residential providers could increase
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
their Staffing and increase their
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
capacity as well
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
um just another item there on the bottom
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
so you use Services Center
 
01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.130 align:start position:0%
so you use Services Center
um

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:03.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
the currently there is an HB I
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
anticipate anyway I haven't seen hb2 yet
 
01:07:11.329 --> 01:07:11.339 align:start position:0%
but I would hope and anticipate that our
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
city new Services Center budget would be
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
included in hb2 it was done like that
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
during the prior biennium when the March
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh the the March 2023 deadline was set
 
01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:24.299 align:start position:0%
for closure of the facility which has
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
since been repealed through the passage
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
of Senate bill one from the 2023
 
01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
legislative session so those are two
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
highlights for that area so so we
 
01:07:35.390 --> 01:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
complicated all that for you
 
01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
um but what what I wonder
 
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.010 align:start position:0%
um but what what I wonder
is

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:40.809 align:start position:0%
is
um

01:07:40.809 --> 01:07:40.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
now that now that you have the green
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
light to go ahead and have an operating
 
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:50.099 align:start position:0%
budget for the the next biennium
 
01:07:53.329 --> 01:07:53.339 align:start position:0%
um do you do you have numbers that
 
01:07:55.849 --> 01:07:55.859 align:start position:0%
you're already ready to request for us
 
01:07:57.770 --> 01:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
to put in I guess we have to put in an
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
hb2 because there's no sununu Center
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
structure in the budget so it has to be
 
01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
an hb2 item but do you do do you have
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
do you have a proposal for us to to
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
evaluate I can absolutely provide a
 
01:08:14.809 --> 01:08:14.819 align:start position:0%
change request proposal to add that to
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill one
 
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
okay and is that do we have a sununu day
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
on our topics list Mr Ripple
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
you have uh day uh at least one day I
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
believe a day and a half for dcyf to
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
come in so you can address the sununu
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
center there I will say I've seen a
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
draft of House Bill 2 and there are
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in there for uh sonuna
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
Youth Center operations in the coming
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
biennium of approximately 11 million
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for that
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
um I want to ask you about the
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
children's residential rates now the the
 
01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that the governor's
 
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
request for 3.1 percent across the board
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid and I realize this isn't
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
specifically Medicaid but it seems to me
 
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
like that could be
 
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
too low on amount but that number we
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
were told came from the Department
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent across the board to help you
 
01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
with with Medicaid rates and and and I'm
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
thinking about these children's
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
residential rates is is talk to me about
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
the 3.1 percent where did that come from
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
is it adequate
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
so when we when we prepare our agency
 
01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:34.669 align:start position:0%
so when we when we prepare our agency
budget

01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
um our work actually starts in March of
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
um and we hold discussions through the
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
spring and into the summer and we submit
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
um approximately mid-september
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and as as you all know we have our
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget representing the
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
existing costs to continue services at
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
these levels and then we have our
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs budget and when we're
 
01:10:00.169 --> 01:10:00.179 align:start position:0%
putting our prioritized needs budget
 
01:10:02.209 --> 01:10:02.219 align:start position:0%
together we're making a number of
 
01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
assumptions at that time and we're also
 
01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
looking at okay we're making a request
 
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
over here we're making a request over
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
here this is really adding up
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
um and so you know the the 3.1 percent
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
is uh and Henry Littman can speak to
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more generally you
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
know when when we're looking at rate
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
increases you know there's no perfect
 
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
figure we recognize that there's limited
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
limited funds available
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and and the figures that you see put
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
for worth in the governor's recommend
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
recommended budget actually reflect our
 
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs we had one in the
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid realm another in the um in a
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
couple of other areas and and I believe
 
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
you will see that reflected in the hb2
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
provision I know he the governor spoke
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
to that the other day but to your point
 
01:10:50.450 --> 01:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
of what's the perfect number
 
01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.370 align:start position:0%
of what's the perfect number
um

01:10:51.370 --> 01:10:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
can I answer in a long-winded way
 
01:10:59.149 --> 01:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay so we we have been thinking about
 
01:11:01.729 --> 01:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
rates and historically we've you know
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
you've seen within hb1 or hb2 you've
 
01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
seen will provide five percent to this
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
organization or CFI will provide you
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
know three percent over here we actually
 
01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.310 align:start position:0%
know three percent over here we actually
established

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
established
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
um we we established a formal rate
 
01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
setting team in the past it was only
 
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Division of Medicaid services
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
Centric we've since established within
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
the department a Medicaid rate setting
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
team and that team is now beginning to
 
01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
look across the department at all of our
 
01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
rates so that we can look at One Rate
 
01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
over here and say that's at market rate
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
when we when we do a a cost analysis and
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
a comparison to other states and we look
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
at this at this rate over here and that
 
01:11:44.030 --> 01:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
rate is well below Market
 
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
and and that's really important because
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
a is consistent with the Social Security
 
01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
Act and and the purpose of of Medicaid
 
01:11:54.649 --> 01:11:54.659 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding um to begin with and so
 
01:11:58.010 --> 01:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
what I I believe what we may see in some
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the language that comes out is is a
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more flexibility and what I'd
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
like to do in the long run I realize the
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
challenges that you that you all will
 
01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
certainly have with this is whether we
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
can use
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more of a of a rate
 
01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
setting methodology that that is based
 
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
on Market rates instead of a system
 
01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
where there are winners and losers
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
because what ends up happening is if a
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
an increase is provided to this provider
 
01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
group over here their stool so to speak
 
01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:31.020 align:start position:0%
just rows and then these people are
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
still left down here I mean I I think in
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
a perfect world and I realize we don't
 
01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
live in a perfect world we never will
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be more to raise the floor but
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
raising three percent necessarily across
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
the board well is certainly a good thing
 
01:12:45.649 --> 01:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
with limited funds if additional funds
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
are available whether we would be able
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
to kind of conduct that analysis of
 
01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
these areas are lower these areas are
 
01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:53.390 align:start position:0%
these areas are lower these areas are
higher

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I mean I I think ultimately that that
 
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
would be a good place in a good
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
direction uh for for us to head
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
you know so when the governor was in
 
01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:06.020 align:start position:0%
here the other day he implied
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
in order to keep it kind of simple at
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget level the 3.1
 
01:13:15.169 --> 01:13:15.179 align:start position:0%
percent went in there and then he went
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
on and elaborated that
 
01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.850 align:start position:0%
on and elaborated that
um

01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:21.709 --> 01:13:21.719 align:start position:0%
that he would he he wouldn't be
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
surprised if the legislature went in
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
there and established some higher rates
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
in some areas and maybe some lower rates
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
in some areas and and he even implied
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
you know there are probably some people
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
getting rates where they're pretty
 
01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
they're pretty well off in other places
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
that are hurting badly and I I don't
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
know if he meant that to be literal but
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's what I took away
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
from it so I I do wonder about how we
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
might go through a process where we can
 
01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
take a look at sort of where all the
 
01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:57.860 align:start position:0%
current rates are and at least identify
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
those spots where we know there's it's
 
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
critical red flashing red that we're in
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
danger of of a of a of a care collapse
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
of some kind so that we can we can
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
prioritize that and um do you do you do
 
01:14:18.110 --> 01:14:18.120 align:start position:0%
you have in your mind a way to lay out
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
all of these rates that this rate
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
setting group has been on is it have
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
they looked at all of the relevant rates
 
01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
that we may want to look at or just
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
still a subset
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
you know I I think it'd be best to have
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
this conversation with Henry Littman in
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
the room as well
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
um I've had offline conversations with
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
Henry about whether we look at you know
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
the the the top 100
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
um payment codes or something along
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
those lines and really conduct an
 
01:14:48.709 --> 01:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
analysis targeted at those which you
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
know would represent a significant
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
portion of of the rates um or the
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
amounts paid that are out there so if if
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
you don't mind I'd probably want to wait
 
01:14:59.930 --> 01:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
until Henry Lipman is here okay okay so
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
take away from this conversation that
 
01:15:05.090 --> 01:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see uh the department able
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
to uh initiate and lead us through a
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
conversation about what the what the
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
right rates ought to be and what
 
01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
right rates ought to be and what
categories

01:15:14.090 --> 01:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
categories
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want you all to be passive
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:22.970 --> 01:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
I just have a very quick one for the
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
Student Center clarification so if the
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
operating funds for the sununu center is
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
in hb2 I just want to clarify that
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
there's the governor has no allocation
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
for construction or the new building at
 
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.830 align:start position:0%
for construction or the new building at
all

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
I have not seen the the formal hb2 is
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
still the office of legislative Services
 
01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:46.310 align:start position:0%
still the office of legislative Services
um

01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any no okay thank you
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
um 10 million dollars allocated for the
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
construction of a new facility in house
 
01:16:03.169 --> 01:16:03.179 align:start position:0%
bill 2. it's appropriated to das which
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
facility I didn't hear what oh uh the
 
01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
student I was just curious if
 
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.870 align:start position:0%
student I was just curious if
construction

01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
um funds were allocated so you said 10
 
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
and is that 10 of General funds that
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
which might be in addition to the 15
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
million that we've been kicking around
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
on ARP for a total of 25 million
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
potentially it only references 10
 
01:16:27.470 --> 01:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
million of General funds but yes that
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
could be added to federal or whatever
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
other source you have okay all right uh
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Waller I think you had a
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
question just
 
01:16:38.649 --> 01:16:38.659 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the figures in the
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services the three percent is
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
already included in all of this right
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
not separate someplace else where we
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
part of it is included in house bill one
 
01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.900 --> 01:17:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
part of it would be in house bill one
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
but the other
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
um I believe 17 million dollars would be
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay so when I'm looking at when I'm
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
um the division of Medicaid services
 
01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.770 align:start position:0%
um the division of Medicaid services
oh

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's a three percent wrapped in is it
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
already here no it it will not be in
 
01:17:30.649 --> 01:17:30.659 align:start position:0%
agency 47. it the the division of
 
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services would be within the
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
hb2 okay
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
okay so so those funds would
 
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:39.900 align:start position:0%
be allocated we were going to need to
 
01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
allocate those
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
three percents or whatever decision is
 
01:17:46.990 --> 01:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
made about them as we go yes okay
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
there's a they're in a bucket someplace
 
01:17:51.890 --> 01:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
yes waiting let me ask you the same
 
01:17:54.290 --> 01:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
question then I've wondered about the 10
 
01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:56.450 align:start position:0%
question then I've wondered about the 10
for

01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
um employees when we're looking at the
 
01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.689 align:start position:0%
um employees when we're looking at the
budget

01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:02.330 --> 01:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we see the Personnel line are those
 
01:18:04.729 --> 01:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
all up 10 percent
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
no no so in in the
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
um the governor's executive summary
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
document that was released in the
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement I believe he had
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
notated hb2 45.4 million something like
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
that in the in 24 and then roughly 55
 
01:18:22.910 --> 01:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the second year
 
01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
um so my my understanding is that will
 
01:18:26.689 --> 01:18:26.699 align:start position:0%
be an hb2 provision but you will not see
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
that in HP one right now
 
01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.689 align:start position:0%
that in HP one right now
okay

01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I want one more and that when
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um your
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
summary Pages here you have
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
areas where you say prioritize needs
 
01:18:46.189 --> 01:18:46.199 align:start position:0%
requests I assume those are not you
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
didn't get those in the governor's
 
01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.070 align:start position:0%
didn't get those in the governor's
budget

01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes at this point that's
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
that's my operating assumption so did
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
you get
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
is that the only prioritized need for
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
that in that area that you didn't get
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and you got all the rest of them or how
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
so does that work what I've tried to do
 
01:19:08.930 --> 01:19:08.940 align:start position:0%
here is highlight some of the big areas
 
01:19:11.390 --> 01:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm fairly certain that we were
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
not funded for um we we did receive a
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
number of our prioritized needs requests
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
um within the operating budget there are
 
01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:21.659 align:start position:0%
some minor technical uh change maybe not
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
technical I'm using the incorrect word
 
01:19:25.910 --> 01:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
there but smaller change requests that
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
that we will certainly put forward to
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
the house uh finance committee for for
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
consideration but what I'm trying to do
 
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
here is really highlight the ones that
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty certain are not and are a
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
larger dollar amount okay
 
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:43.260 align:start position:0%
oh okay so now I I just need to make
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
sure I understand how to use this
 
01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.219 align:start position:0%
document the hb1 document that we got
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
from the governor's budget
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh listening to the answer to
 
01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative wallner's question is I
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
look at a Personnel line
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
I should mentally add 10 to it to cover
 
01:20:03.830 --> 01:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent pay raise that the
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
governor wants in there and then I need
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
to figure out that Delta and mentally
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
add it to the bottom line
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
is that is that
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
correct is that what I need to do or is
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
that going to be in a new spreadsheet so
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
we're all looking at the proposal the
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
real proposal yeah you know I I would
 
01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
probably end up deferring to the LBA on
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
that because typically an hb2 provision
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
would be represented within the Surplus
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
statement and you'll have your revenues
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
expenditures and hp2 Appropriations and
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
they'll have the table so I mean that
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
that is certainly one way to think about
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
it if you wanted to come up with the
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
exact figure though or make a rough
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
figure anyway
 
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
all right I don't know if you want to
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
comment now Mr Ripple but I I
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
it just makes my head hurt to think that
 
01:20:55.010 --> 01:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
every time I look at a section of the
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
budget I got to do a 10 calculation in
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
my head and drop it to the to the total
 
01:21:05.630 --> 01:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and unfortunately I think the house
 
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
bill 2 appropriation is one lump sum for
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
the entire state so it's not broken out
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
by Department let alone by division I'm
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
not sure if it's as simple as just
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
adding 10 to say class 10 because you
 
01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
would also have benefits and some other
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
costs in there that would be affected so
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
I'll have to think about how we can
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
so that that makes me ask another
 
01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
question is the 10
 
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
um actually a pay increase and an
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
employee will get an additional 10 of
 
01:21:38.209 --> 01:21:38.219 align:start position:0%
their wages
 
01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
and then we have to calculate
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
increased benefits
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
well to the extent the benefits are
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
driven by wages so social security for
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
example would be so yeah so there would
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
be a few impacts like that retirement
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:56.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:58.189 --> 01:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative but just to be clear
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
those that those will be included in
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
that lump sum and hb2
 
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:07.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I I have to look into it
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
so still somebody else representative
 
01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
stream well first of all I'm glad the
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
increase is 10 and 9 not
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
9.1615 because the math is a little
 
01:22:26.219 --> 01:22:27.770 align:start position:0%
9.1615 because the math is a little
easier

01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:22:31.610 --> 01:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
but uh um you know I just you know uh to
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
follow up in the theme of beating one of
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
these charts to death
 
01:22:38.209 --> 01:22:38.219 align:start position:0%
um uh the do you do you have a sense of
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
of um how much Services is increased for
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
example if there's
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
30 000 medical visits
 
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:49.980 align:start position:0%
um uh you know is the Assumption we're
 
01:22:51.169 --> 01:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
gonna have thirty thousand medical
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
visits the next year or is this
 
01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
anticipating both increase in cost per
 
01:22:59.930 --> 01:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
visit or cost per uh interaction as well
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
as of expected volume
 
01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh is that something we would expect to
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
get through this process thanks
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
are you referring to to slide 17 I I
 
01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:16.189 align:start position:0%
are you referring to to slide 17 I I
apologize

01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
16 still yeah for example uh
 
01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:22.010 align:start position:0%
16 still yeah for example uh
um

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
you know I think you mentioned top 100
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
codes that sounded like medical uh
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
office visits and things like that that
 
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:32.540 align:start position:0%
would fall under a Medicaid Program
 
01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.330 align:start position:0%
would fall under a Medicaid Program
so

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:34.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:37.010 --> 01:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
you could change the rate which would
 
01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:39.780 align:start position:0%
change the cost or you could change the
 
01:23:42.169 --> 01:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
the amount of Demand on Individual
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
Services so I'm just kind of one looking
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
through the Looking Glass what are we
 
01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
going to see
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
in there all right
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know if I necessarily
 
01:23:56.090 --> 01:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
want to speculate that on that that's
 
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
not my area of expertise and that would
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
probably I I can put a pin in that and
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
set that aside and just let Henry

discussion

01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
okay so just a question there though um
 
01:24:11.810 --> 01:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
we know that we're going down in the
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
population served for Medicaid right in
 
01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
the next two years so there's that is
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
factored in there right but in terms of
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
claims I think is what you're asking I
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
think Henry would be able to give you
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
that detail
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:27.229 align:start position:0%
thank you
excellent

01:24:27.229 --> 01:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh if you turn to slide 18
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
it's the division of Public Health
 
01:24:32.219 --> 01:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
it's the division of Public Health
Services

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
Services
 
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.010 align:start position:0%
Services
um

01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
the division of Public Health Services
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
is heavily federally funded
 
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the governor's
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
recommended budget there's approximately
 
01:24:44.990 --> 01:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
74 accounts it actually represents a
 
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:48.360 align:start position:0%
significant number of hhs's accounts and
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for that is that each
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
of the grants
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
um that public health receives is
 
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
actually budgeted in a separate
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
accounting unit in order to ensure the
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
funds are accounted for clear and
 
01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.430 align:start position:0%
funds are accounted for clear and
transparent

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
um we did we we did submit
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
um one prioritized need that that I do
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
not expect to be within hb2 and and this
 
01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:12.659 align:start position:0%
was to replace uh temporary funding that
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
that we had or received to support
 
01:25:16.669 --> 01:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
contracts for maternal infant and early
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
childhood home visiting programs we have
 
01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
received in the past we've received some
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
governor's commission funds we did
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
receive some supplemental funds from the
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
federal government which are going away
 
01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
which essentially leaves a gap in these
 
01:25:33.239 --> 01:25:35.330 align:start position:0%
which essentially leaves a gap in these
services

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:36.830 align:start position:0%
services
um

01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
I don't know if are there any questions
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
so so this uh let's just look at 24.
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
there's uh 19.7 in general funds and
 
01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
77.3 and I'm I'm hearing you that
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
um this is just an area where federal
 
01:25:59.570 --> 01:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
funds are really the dominant Source I'm
 
01:26:03.410 --> 01:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
curious of the 19.7 the general funds is
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
is all of that essentially committed due
 
01:26:09.470 --> 01:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
to matching requirements or or how much
 
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:13.980 align:start position:0%
of that 19.7 remains a bit I'll use the
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
word discretionary
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
to to juxtapose it from us pursuing
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
Federal money by putting our own ante in
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah very little
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
um of the general funds within dphs I
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
would consider quote unquote
 
01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
discretionary most of a lot of that is
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
wrapped up
 
01:26:35.030 --> 01:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
um within positions that are then
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
matched with with various federal grants
 
01:26:38.570 --> 01:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
depending on whether an individual works
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
on One Federal grant two or three
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
federal grants
 
01:26:44.450 --> 01:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
um and and what's allocated to their
 
01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
particular position
 
01:26:49.450 --> 01:26:49.460 align:start position:0%
um but Public Health I mean
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
globally it's it's it's it's a
 
01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
relatively small amount of the general
 
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
funds that the department does receive
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
but but there's not a lot of
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
um to use a colloquial term wiggle room
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
so to speak all right thanks of course
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
any questions on this we could go to the
 
01:27:08.750 --> 01:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
next slide excellent uh slide 19 the
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health
 
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:11.890 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health
um

01:27:11.890 --> 01:27:11.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
we we do have
 
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.070 align:start position:0%
we we do have
um

01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and maybe it's just a little bit
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
easier to address here so you will see
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
General funds in in 2022 uh were
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
approximately actual spend or
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 43 million
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
through hb2
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
um in 23 there was a 13 million dollar
 
01:27:35.090 --> 01:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
appropriation for child welfare
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health Services and there was
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
also a six million dollar uh
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
appropriation for transitional housing
 
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
which is why you're seeing you're seeing
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty dramatic increase year over
 
01:27:50.110 --> 01:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
year and and uh
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
7.6 million dollars of that initial
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
appropriation is six million dollars is
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
reflected in state fiscal year 24 so
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
that became part of our efficiency
 
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.709 align:start position:0%
that became part of our efficiency
budget

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to really address that
 
01:28:04.129 --> 01:28:04.139 align:start position:0%
that general fund increase that you're
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
seeing there that's the result of those
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions from hb2 from the current
 
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
biennium uh just to address that head-on
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
um the the children's system of care
 
01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:18.050 align:start position:0%
um the the children's system of care
um

01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
we we did include a prioritized needed
 
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
request to enhance the the residential
 
01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:26.219 align:start position:0%
rates this is similar to dcyf depending
 
01:28:29.870 --> 01:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
on um the the child's needs at a
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
residential treatment facility
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
um that may be budgeted or or accounted
 
01:28:37.610 --> 01:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
for through Behavioral Health depending
 
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
on whether it's a behavioral health
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
issue or it may be through dcyf and
 
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's why you see this prioritized need
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I do expect Katya Fox to also
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
discuss this separately when she be
 
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
comes before house finance division
 
01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:54.290 align:start position:0%
comes before house finance division
three

01:28:54.290 --> 01:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
so the money that flows through the area
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
agencies to help the DD Community is is
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
that in this Behavior Behavioral Health
 
01:29:05.209 --> 01:29:05.219 align:start position:0%
bucket where where was that that'll be
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
on the next slide okay yep we also had a
 
01:29:11.090 --> 01:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
prioritizing request for crisis
 
01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
stabilization Services as well
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
um which which I do not believe will be
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
funded and I know Katya will be speaking
 
01:29:19.610 --> 01:29:19.620 align:start position:0%
to that as well
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the division of economic stability is
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
your next slide slide 20 and
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
um this this is the the area agency
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%
agency oh I'm sorry I'm jumping ahead
 
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
nope not a next one
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
there we go
 
01:29:35.810 --> 01:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
um division of economic stability this
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
is the team that is going to be
 
01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
um at the floor level so to speak of
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Medicaid disenrollment
 
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.610 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Medicaid disenrollment
process

01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the the individuals that work within
 
01:29:48.110 --> 01:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
this division they will be addressing
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
those phone calls following up seeking
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
documentation to ensure an individual is
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
I can either continue to be eligible for
 
01:29:57.890 --> 01:29:57.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or is no longer eligible for
 
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:00.900 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I know Karen Karen Hebert
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
our division director will be speaking
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
with you about some of the challenges uh
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
there and just about some of the the
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
potential risks that we do see if we are
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
unable to process all of those
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
um uh in disenrollments and
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
re-enrollments in a timely fashion
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
are there any questions on the slide
 
01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:26.060 align:start position:0%
before I move on and yes
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
thank you when you say repercussions
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
does that mean like National
 
01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.590 align:start position:0%
does that mean like National
um

01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
fees or
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
non-compliance fees or are we more
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
worried about people not having
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
insurance and and burdening other
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
systems well there's there's a couple of
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
sides I guess to that coin if if I can
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
have a coin with more than two sides um
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
but but one side is certainly to make
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
sure that people who who are eligible
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid receive those Services
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
which they are entitled to and then the
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
the other side of that of course if
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
there are individuals who should be
 
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:04.370 align:start position:0%
there are individuals who should be
disenrolled

01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
disenrolled
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
um but through an appeal process say
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
um they they continue to stay you know
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
they continue to stay on the roll you
 
01:31:12.830 --> 01:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
know then that has a cost to the state
 
01:31:15.590 --> 01:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we cannot uh be reimbursed for from
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government so so there's a
 
01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
couple of of risks both from you know
 
01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:22.139 align:start position:0%
both from the the population side of
 
01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
who's receiving
 
01:31:26.270 --> 01:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid as well as the cost to the
 
01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:31.129 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid as well as the cost to the
state

01:31:31.129 --> 01:31:31.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner is this the area
 
01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.910 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner is this the area
where

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.110 align:start position:0%
where
um

01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
we would find the Tana free Reserve fund
 
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
and if so how much is in the tanfreserve
 
01:31:45.229 --> 01:31:45.239 align:start position:0%
at this point TANF
 
01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:51.540 align:start position:0%
TANF Reserve as of December 31st 2022 is
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 67 million dollars
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
and that's that's budgeted in a couple
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
of different areas
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
um we did have we did have a prioritized
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
needs request
 
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
um for three million dollars to meet our
 
01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
TANF uh match and and for members of the
 
01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee we have to spend approximately
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
32 million dollars annually in general
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
funds in order to receive our 38 million
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
dollar Federal TANF match and if we do
 
01:32:24.290 --> 01:32:24.300 align:start position:0%
not spend the full amount so let's say
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
we spend 30 million dollars the
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
subsequent year will have a two million
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
dollar penalty and they'll also give us
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
two million dollars less so if you're
 
01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
short two you're actually the subsequent
 
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
year you receive four million dollars
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
less than federal funds there's also a
 
01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
work requirement
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
um that that instead of having our match
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
be at 34 million it's at 32 million
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
and if 50 of individuals that are
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
receiving TANF or less than uh do not
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
are not actively I I I'll have to go
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
back and double check this but are not
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
actively engaged in work or searching
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
for work I don't know the specifics off
 
01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
um we would then have an additional
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
penalty that could be applied to that so
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's just a couple of factors when
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
we're talking about uh TANF to be aware
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
of so so we have some new people I
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
should ask you one of you to spell Tana
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
for us and and what's it mean and what's
 
01:33:26.090 --> 01:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
it try to do sure uh temporary
 
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
assistance for needy families is is the
 
01:33:31.610 --> 01:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
the federal term
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
um do you know a lot about the program
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
aspects of it I'm not as familiar well I
 
01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
think we'll get the detail when folks
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
come I mean it pretty much is providing
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
that financial assistance for folks who
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
fall below a certain amount of the
 
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
poverty poverty level
 
01:33:48.410 --> 01:33:48.420 align:start position:0%
um I I did want to ask a question though
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
that the 66 million you were asked you
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
were asking is it in here it's not
 
01:33:54.649 --> 01:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the division economic
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
stability rate it's spread out into
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
different yes I'm not sure if that was
 
01:33:59.219 --> 01:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
different yes I'm not sure if that was
clear

01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:34:02.990 --> 01:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
so as we go through the budget you'll
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
point out to us where the TANF Reserve
 
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
funds are being used yes okay thank you
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
questions so good all right I think
 
01:34:15.410 --> 01:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
we're ready for 21. all right
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
um the division of long-term supports
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
and services uh
 
01:34:21.290 --> 01:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
so a couple of things that that I think
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
are really important to know about this
 
01:34:23.219 --> 01:34:24.169 align:start position:0%
are really important to know about this
division

01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:34:26.330 --> 01:34:26.340 align:start position:0%
um there are two accounting units within
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
this division that I expect will spend
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time on
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
um one is 2152 and that is for nursing
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
home payments and so when we talk about
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
the county cap which I'm sure we're
 
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about a lot
 
01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
2152 is that account there's about 326
 
01:34:45.709 --> 01:34:45.719 align:start position:0%
million 342 million dollars budgeted
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
within that account the second account
 
01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
is the DD account and that's 7 100.
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
um that is an account that that is
 
01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:56.300 align:start position:0%
budgeted at approximately 414 million
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
417 million
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and and and I know
 
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
um the committee has already had
 
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
discussions about the the DD system
 
01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.229 align:start position:0%
discussions about the the DD system
changes

01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
um in in recent times but but this is
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
certainly uh I expect this to to come up
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
during the budget process
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
um we the department has been working
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
for well over a year now and change
 
01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
on making changes to the the payment uh
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
system that we use uh within the DD
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
system with the area agencies we've been
 
01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
on a corrective action plan for
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
approximately five years now
 
01:35:33.709 --> 01:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and and we've been making progress
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
towards rectifying but basically what
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
the issue has come down to is
 
01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:39.709 align:start position:0%
the issue has come down to is
historically

01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
um we've been the area agencies have
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
been billing on behalf of the providers
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
and taking a piece of that uh to to
 
01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
cover administrative costs and so
 
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:50.629 align:start position:0%
cover administrative costs and so
historically

01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:35:52.729 --> 01:35:52.739 align:start position:0%
um the public and and and the finance
 
01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
legislature hasn't been able to
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily determine what portion of
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
that is being used for administrative
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
costs versus what portion of that is
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
being used for provider costs
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the system that that the department
 
01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy she's the division
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
director for long-term supports and
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
services will be speaking to is is to
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
establish an administrative rate to to
 
01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:17.699 align:start position:0%
pay the area agencies to cover costs and
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
then have the provider which were
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
historically and continue to contract
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the area agencies for those
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
services to direct Bill the state and
 
01:36:29.270 --> 01:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've been working on a number of our
 
01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
contracts to make sure that during that
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
transition period
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
um you know if the area agency has to
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
Bill during for a certain time frame
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
they can still do that or if because if
 
01:36:40.729 --> 01:36:40.739 align:start position:0%
a provider fails to register for
 
01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:43.380 align:start position:0%
Medicaid we want to make sure that that
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
you know the system doesn't
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't experience any significant
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
interruptions so I do expect to have
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
some fruitful conversations there so so
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
in direct billing one of the feedback
 
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
I'm receiving from the community in
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
general the area agency specifically is
 
01:37:07.010 --> 01:37:07.020 align:start position:0%
that the I.T systems to support direct
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
billing are just not out there and and
 
01:37:12.830 --> 01:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they're freaked out over a one July
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
implementation when they don't have an
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
I.T rollout to support the change it to
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
what extent do you think that's accurate
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't necessarily I can't really
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
comment on the I.T support what I can
 
01:37:28.330 --> 01:37:28.340 align:start position:0%
say is every other provider in the state
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
uses the the system
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
um and and I know there's been extensive
 
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
engagement at last count there are about
 
01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:39.980 align:start position:0%
250 telephonic or Zoom plus in-person
 
01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
sessions that have been held with the
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
area agencies providers in other
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.330 --> 01:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
area agencies are billing us now so they
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to do that now so the
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
providers we've been working with the
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
providers to be able to do that if they
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
can't get it um get the in place in time
 
01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:02.219 align:start position:0%
the area agency can still bill on behalf
 
01:38:06.649 --> 01:38:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
so I assume from the name direct billing
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
that the end state is that if I'm Dr
 
01:38:16.610 --> 01:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
Edwards providing care to a client then
 
01:38:19.550 --> 01:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
I do direct billing I go from Dr Edwards
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
straight to DHHS to get reimbursed and
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
bypass the year okay what so what what
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
do you imagine the um the maturity time
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
on that to be that transition is that a
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
year transition two-year transition will
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
never get there oh I think we'll get
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
there there's been a lot of work over
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
the last year and a half to get there
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
and I think we will land around July 1st
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
for some to uh well I should be for all
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that I think when we
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
get to the Melissa Hardy can talk in
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
detail to you about what are the pain
 
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
points or potential limitations to
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
hitting that but right now we're on
 
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
track to to meet that implementation
 
01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.890 align:start position:0%
track to to meet that implementation
date

01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
date
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay would one of you just very quickly
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
describe conflict-free case management
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
and what do we intentionally have a
 
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
conflict enhanced Care Management now
 
01:39:15.530 --> 01:39:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit of a joke
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
so um the the difference there and again
 
01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
I I think Melissa Hardy can speak to
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
this much more
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
um intelligently than I can but an area
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
agency currently may be providing client
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
services and then maybe coordinating
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
provider Direct Services and CMS
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
regulations requires that there be a
 
01:39:37.490 --> 01:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
separation between those two things so
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
the the tentative plan is that an area
 
01:39:42.169 --> 01:39:42.179 align:start position:0%
agency could provide the Direct Services
 
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
or the client services to an individual
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
but could not provide both to ensure
 
01:39:48.890 --> 01:39:48.900 align:start position:0%
that that we can maintain compliance
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
with that CMS regulation
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
so essentially it's ensuring that they
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
can't do any form of self-referral by
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
requiring separation
 
01:39:59.450 --> 01:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
any questions all right thank you let's
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
go to the next one New Hampshire
 
01:40:06.410 --> 01:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
hospital is next as we all know New
 
01:40:08.510 --> 01:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital is our our 24-hour
 
01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:11.300 align:start position:0%
State psychiatric facility
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
Ellen Lapointe our
 
01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
CEO at New Hampshire hospital she was
 
01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
here a couple weeks ago talking about
 
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
some of the Staffing challenges uh
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
particularly with the nursing and the
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
social workers and that continues to
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
impact that availability there the
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
forensic facility Construction
 
01:40:31.790 --> 01:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh when we submitted our agency budget
 
01:40:34.729 --> 01:40:34.739 align:start position:0%
back this summer we were anticipating
 
01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we would have an opening in
 
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
mid-july of 2024
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
um as as Ellen explained last time we
 
01:40:43.850 --> 01:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
have uh based on on some of the
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
architect design work that has been done
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
additional remediation work will need to
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
be completed on the site because as
 
01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:53.340 align:start position:0%
anybody that's been over there it's a
 
01:40:55.610 --> 01:40:55.620 align:start position:0%
very wet area
 
01:40:58.250 --> 01:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
um and given the current climate in the
 
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
construction environment we are we are
 
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:04.100 align:start position:0%
not anticipating an opening until until
 
01:41:07.729 --> 01:41:07.739 align:start position:0%
mid-2025 at this point in time so you
 
01:41:10.810 --> 01:41:10.820 align:start position:0%
you will not see any any staffing
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
currently budgeted in that area partly
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
partly for that reason
 
01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.770 align:start position:0%
partly for that reason
so

01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
the next slide is Glencliff home uh
 
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
glencliffe home
 
01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
um as I indicated earlier is about 100
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
about almost 170 individuals that that
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
work there and provide services they've
 
01:41:31.669 --> 01:41:31.679 align:start position:0%
experienced some of the same Staffing
 
01:41:31.679 --> 01:41:33.410 align:start position:0%
experienced some of the same Staffing
challenges

01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.060 align:start position:0%
um as well additionally if you've ever
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
been to Glencliff home it is in a very
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
remote location it is quote unquote Off
 
01:41:42.109 --> 01:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
the Grid
 
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's not necessarily easiest
 
01:41:45.830 --> 01:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
to get to which presents labor market
 
01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
challenges for them we do have a lower
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
census than we have historically had
 
01:41:55.729 --> 01:41:55.739 align:start position:0%
as a result of that we we project that
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
we're going to be bringing in lower
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
patient Revenue than we have
 
01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
historically received
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
um we we we originally submitted a
 
01:42:06.290 --> 01:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs request for
 
01:42:10.010 --> 01:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
approximately 1.1 million dollars which
 
01:42:12.169 --> 01:42:12.179 align:start position:0%
is the difference between our our
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
current projections
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
um the general funds that are
 
01:42:17.209 --> 01:42:17.219 align:start position:0%
appropriated and the other funds or
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
patient Revenue that that we would bring
 
01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:22.020 align:start position:0%
in and that's 1.1 million dollars in
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
representative I can you remind me why
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
this doesn't qualify for federal funds
 
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what can you imagine why this
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
the Glen Club Farm doesn't qualify for
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
federal fund there's no match there
 
01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:41.870 align:start position:0%
federal fund there's no match there
I

01:42:41.870 --> 01:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
let me get back to you on an easy answer
 
01:42:47.270 --> 01:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to misspeak
 
01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.350 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to misspeak
sure

01:42:48.350 --> 01:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
I do know that there are no federal
 
01:42:57.890 --> 01:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
and finally on the subsequent page slide
 
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.590 align:start position:0%
and finally on the subsequent page slide
24

01:43:02.590 --> 01:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
24
 
01:43:04.790 --> 01:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital Residential Treatment
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
Facility as you all know we acquired
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital
 
01:43:14.030 --> 01:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
um back in June 8th uh the the sale was
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
finalized and the state took over I
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
referenced this earlier we are we are
 
01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
seeking to convert 21 currently
 
01:43:23.270 --> 01:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time positions to
 
01:43:26.590 --> 01:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
full-time authorized positions
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the the positions that
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
that that we do have there these are the
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions only which were
 
01:43:38.709 --> 01:43:38.719 align:start position:0%
formally approved
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
you will see a a slight decrease in um
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
or maybe not a slight you will see a
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
decrease in general funds in the second
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
year we're still working on our on our
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
analysis of revenues I believe I spoke
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
about this last time when Hampstead
 
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
presented at this point in time we don't
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a great history we
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
don't really have a great history to
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
draw from to project revenues right now
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
the way that it's budgeted we are
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
um hoping anticipating for more patient
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
revenues than than um than in the first
 
01:44:16.729 --> 01:44:16.739 align:start position:0%
year which provides a buffer because we
 
01:44:19.609 --> 01:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
do have a number of unknowns because
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're not able to use the prior owners
 
01:44:25.490 --> 01:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
financials to predict our own our own
 
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
situation given a significant change in
 
01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:29.870 align:start position:0%
situation given a significant change in
operations

01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
um and and the methodologies that were
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
used that we're using so
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up on
 
01:44:41.090 --> 01:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
um representative Earth's question I
 
01:44:44.450 --> 01:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
both New Hampshire hospital
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
glencliffe home and Hampstead none of
 
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
them have federal funds
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
does it have anything to do with them
 
01:44:55.729 --> 01:44:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
federal funds are not available for
 
01:45:02.390 --> 01:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
I believe any of the medic Medicaid
 
01:45:04.619 --> 01:45:05.990 align:start position:0%
I believe any of the medic Medicaid
funds

01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital or like the
 
01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
dish funds those would actually come
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
through as other funds within that line
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't be they wouldn't show
 
01:45:15.649 --> 01:45:15.659 align:start position:0%
as federal funds there okay but but
 
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
again I I just want to go back and and
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
get get a better answer for you okay
 
01:45:22.750 --> 01:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank thank you sure
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
what's what's the process on positions
 
01:45:27.530 --> 01:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
when you're seeking to convert 21
 
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
full-time temps to full-time authorized
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
what what is what's the process for that
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
because I I I've been curious about if
 
01:45:38.870 --> 01:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
if this committee has any influence on
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
that or not and I've never actually seen
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
an action that I recognize as as doing
 
01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:46.250 align:start position:0%
an action that I recognize as as doing
this

01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
so so in normal normal time so to speak
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
beginning in February and March we we
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
submit to the governor's office we say
 
01:45:58.609 --> 01:45:58.619 align:start position:0%
okay we have these positions that are
 
01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:01.139 align:start position:0%
currently temporary full-time we'd like
 
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:03.540 align:start position:0%
to convert them to permanent authorized
 
01:46:05.270 --> 01:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
positions so they'll show up before you
 
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:07.260 align:start position:0%
within the recommended Governor's
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
recommended budget
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:46:14.330 --> 01:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
really unique acquisition and nature of
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
of Hampstead we did not have that
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
opportunity through this this prior
 
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:20.390 align:start position:0%
opportunity through this this prior
process

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and and I defer to to the LBA on
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
whether something like this has occurred
 
01:46:28.010 --> 01:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
in recent times as far as conversions
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
temporary to full time
 
01:46:31.199 --> 01:46:32.510 align:start position:0%
temporary to full time
yeah

01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I'll have to check into
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
so so these are 21 temporary positions
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
that are part of Hampstead Hospital and
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
not the residential treatment facility
 
01:46:48.649 --> 01:46:48.659 align:start position:0%
or those one in the same what's the
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
distinction here
 
01:46:51.890 --> 01:46:51.900 align:start position:0%
because today's the first time I've seen
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
the the two things appended to one
 
01:46:55.490 --> 01:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
another like that
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
they're one in the same yeah it's one
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
long name Hampstead Hospital Residential
 
01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility so those 21 positions
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
got caught up in this weird period of
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
time that need to be fully converted
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
over so that their state full-time
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
positions in addition to the sixth
 
01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:13.870 align:start position:0%
positions in addition to the sixth
unclassified

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
unclassified
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay so that's just the same name that's
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
one long name got it
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh anything else for us
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh no that's that's it at this point I
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
was hoping to speak to hb2 but we don't
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
yet have a copy of that so can't really
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
have a personal discussion so let me let
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
me play something back to you to see if
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
this makes sense to you you've provided
 
01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:38.100 align:start position:0%
us with your contact information
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
and I would like to reserve the
 
01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
committee contacting you directly for
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
really urgent things and those urgent
 
01:47:48.770 --> 01:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
things will happen as we get closer to
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
our drop dead date in the committee and
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a standard operating
 
01:47:55.310 --> 01:47:55.320 align:start position:0%
procedure for the committee if you have
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
questions that you think Mr White can
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
answer please please send them to Mr
 
01:48:03.649 --> 01:48:03.659 align:start position:0%
Ripple and let Mr Ripple be the the
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
broker so that there's some sort of
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
communication and flow control taking
 
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:09.850 align:start position:0%
communication and flow control taking
place

01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:09.860 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
is that is that okay with the people I
 
01:48:16.129 --> 01:48:16.139 align:start position:0%
just named Mr White Mr Ripple and
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:48:26.050 --> 01:48:26.060 align:start position:0%
um I I I want to I want to go back to
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
basic strategy which goes to the idea of
 
01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
how do we Define what the the biggest
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
challenges are facing our state and I'll
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
run for you what I I see is sort of the
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge the the thing that
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
keeps me up at night and and maybe you
 
01:48:48.350 --> 01:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
could give me some feedback on this but
 
01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
could give me some feedback on this but
um

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:53.570 --> 01:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing is that we have a
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
problem with our clinical flow that that
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
we have bottlenecks in emergency rooms
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
where we're feeling filling emergency
 
01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:04.669 align:start position:0%
where we're feeling filling emergency
rooms

01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
rooms
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
um and keeping people there for
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
prolonged times because there's capacity
 
01:49:12.189 --> 01:49:12.199 align:start position:0%
issues in that particular institution
 
01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
and then on the back side we've got an
 
01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.729 align:start position:0%
and then on the back side we've got an
inadequate

01:49:18.729 --> 01:49:18.739 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
01:49:22.250 --> 01:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
catcher's mitt for the patients to get
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
stepped down from those Ed base or those
 
01:49:27.189 --> 01:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals with Ed base
 
01:49:30.169 --> 01:49:30.179 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a catcher Schmidt to
 
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
send them closer to their home
 
01:49:35.450 --> 01:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
so what I think is maybe the biggest
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
priority of the state from a systems
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
perspective and this is bigger than DHHS
 
01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
I think but
 
01:49:49.390 --> 01:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
how how do we
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
fix that flow problem what what do we
 
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
need to do to make sure that the
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
catcher's mitt is big enough
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
to allow a flow out of our hospitals
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a huge issue right the
 
01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
system is clogged everywhere right on
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
the front end and on the back end so in
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
any given day we have people in our care
 
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:18.540 align:start position:0%
that are ready for discharge but have
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
nowhere to go
 
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
there's places for them to go but they
 
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the beds because they don't
 
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
have the staff
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
right so we build a children's system of
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
care we have programs but yet we can't
 
01:50:31.790 --> 01:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
open up every bed in every program and
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
level of care because they don't have
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
the Staffing
 
01:50:37.550 --> 01:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
so it's the thing that keeps me up at
 
01:50:39.649 --> 01:50:39.659 align:start position:0%
night as well is that we have people in
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
care that maybe don't need that level of
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
care and then we're people needing to
 
01:50:48.169 --> 01:50:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
so we agree on the problem I think so
 
01:50:53.870 --> 01:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
what do you what do you see us needing
 
01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
to do in the next year or two to make it
 
01:50:58.129 --> 01:50:58.139 align:start position:0%
less of a problem
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
what what's like the key driver we've
 
01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
talked about changing the reimbursement
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
rates for Medicaid and for other rates
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
on the belief that if we pump more money
 
01:51:10.490 --> 01:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
into the provider side of the equation
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to acquire more manpower
 
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
which will open up more capacity I think
 
01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
that's the general assumption that we're
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
working with here is that is that the is
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
that your assumption that if we can
 
01:51:25.729 --> 01:51:25.739 align:start position:0%
increase those rates we're going to draw
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
Manpower from somewhere to expand the
 
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:29.689 align:start position:0%
Manpower from somewhere to expand the
capacity

01:51:29.689 --> 01:51:29.699 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:51:31.970 --> 01:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
I mean rates are definitely key right
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
they need to be able to not only pay the
 
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
staff but run the facility right and do
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
what they need to do I think it's also
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
in some cases we may we may need some
 
01:51:44.770 --> 01:51:44.780 align:start position:0%
additional Services when we think about
 
01:51:48.950 --> 01:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
drf beds we probably can relieve a
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
little bit that way but that's not going
 
01:51:52.729 --> 01:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
to core systemically change it like the
 
01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
like rates would
 
01:51:56.330 --> 01:51:56.340 align:start position:0%
and community-based Services I guess as
 
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
well I mean are there other when we look
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the cans assessments that we're doing
 
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
we think about trying to keep kids out
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
of the system it's can we provide how
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
many of how much Services can we provide
 
01:52:08.570 --> 01:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
in the community without having to have
 
01:52:10.370 --> 01:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
it be in some of these systems and have
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
those systems when I say systems
 
01:52:15.649 --> 01:52:15.659 align:start position:0%
programs service those populations that
 
01:52:17.209 --> 01:52:17.219 align:start position:0%
need it the most and trying to keep most
 
01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
people out of that that array unless
 
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely needed so it's it's kind
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
of like fixing the system that exists
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
now but also building up like when we
 
01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
think about mobile crisis right that was
 
01:52:30.169 --> 01:52:30.179 align:start position:0%
a relief in the sense that it was able
 
01:52:31.729 --> 01:52:31.739 align:start position:0%
to go out to people but now it's still
 
01:52:33.290 --> 01:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
not enough right we need we need to
 
01:52:34.970 --> 01:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
increase that capacity and that's one of
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
the things that I mentioned was
 
01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
increasing that behavioral system Health
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
System access so it's there's multi
 
01:52:44.930 --> 01:52:44.940 align:start position:0%
pieces to it it's not just rates I mean
 
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
it is about making sure the services are
 
01:52:48.890 --> 01:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
provided to the right people in the
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
is there any room to get capacity by
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
playing with
 
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
um oh there's a term of art for this
 
01:53:03.229 --> 01:53:03.239 align:start position:0%
where each type of health care provider
 
01:53:05.330 --> 01:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
has a standard of practice I think
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's a standard of practices uh can we
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
do anything with standards of practices
 
01:53:15.169 --> 01:53:15.179 align:start position:0%
so that we can still provide some
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
quality to our patients but just get
 
01:53:19.850 --> 01:53:19.860 align:start position:0%
more capacity into the system by
 
01:53:23.450 --> 01:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
accepting you know perhaps less trained
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers into the system
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
well I mean when we think about
 
01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:30.290 align:start position:0%
well I mean when we think about
um

01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:30.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.209 --> 01:53:32.219 align:start position:0%
some of the work that some of our
 
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.020 align:start position:0%
providers have done with Workforce right
 
01:53:35.149 --> 01:53:35.159 align:start position:0%
what are some of the things that are
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
holding people back from being able to
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
hire staff licensing right reciprocity
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
being able to have people come from over
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
and not have to go through all this red
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
tape to be able to provide services so
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
somebody have a question representative
 
01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:55.790 align:start position:0%
somebody have a question representative
Wallner

01:53:55.790 --> 01:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.990 align:start position:0%
Wallner
well

01:53:56.990 --> 01:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
when I think about the the whole
 
01:54:00.890 --> 01:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
situation I think about
 
01:54:03.169 --> 01:54:03.179 align:start position:0%
how much emphasis are we putting on
 
01:54:03.179 --> 01:54:04.550 align:start position:0%
how much emphasis are we putting on
prevention

01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
because at some point we're paying for
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
all the high-end Services I mean we are
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
spending millions and millions and
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars on those very
 
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.060 align:start position:0%
high-end services and if we could get to
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
the point where we were preventing
 
01:54:23.689 --> 01:54:23.699 align:start position:0%
really worked like with families young
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
children people before they get into the
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
system and we I think we would be able
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
to really avoid some of those higher
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
those higher cost programs so I don't
 
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:39.540 align:start position:0%
know how much is in this budget from the
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
Department around prevention but that's
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
where I that's what I always go to how
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
do we how do we sort of stop what we're
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
how do we stop We Can't Stop what we're
 
01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
doing but how do we at least invest in
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
prevention so that the Next Generation
 
01:54:58.490 --> 01:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
won't have all of these issues
 
01:55:00.649 --> 01:55:00.659 align:start position:0%
I think you'll when you when you hear a
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
lot from DC wife about the work that
 
01:55:03.890 --> 01:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
they're doing a lot of that work is
 
01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:05.820 align:start position:0%
prevention is getting getting before
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
they get to a higher level of care and
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
keeping them in the community or if they
 
01:55:11.450 --> 01:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
are getting to a higher level of care
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
right our children's uh behavioral
 
01:55:17.450 --> 01:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
system is built that the reason of the
 
01:55:19.070 --> 01:55:19.080 align:start position:0%
five levels is so that we don't have
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
somebody in a need that they don't need
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
but that they could go down and go back
 
01:55:23.629 --> 01:55:23.639 align:start position:0%
into the community right it's sort of
 
01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
like that safety net
 
01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
um not a long-term solution right it's a
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
point in time of of service and
 
01:55:29.219 --> 01:55:32.570 align:start position:0%
point in time of of service and
treatment

01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
all right any questions here we got
 
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
people in the audience who've been
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
listening to anyone feel the compelling
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
need to speak up and say something share
 
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.169 align:start position:0%
need to speak up and say something share
something

01:55:45.169 --> 01:55:45.179 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:55:47.699 --> 01:55:48.649 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
rep commissioner do you have any last
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
words I I want to thank you this has
 
01:55:55.310 --> 01:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
been two hours of your time and then
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
fairly intense and Mr White thank you
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
very much thank you
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so if you'd like to leave your
 
01:56:08.149 --> 01:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
your free free to go thank you yeah and
 
01:56:10.609 --> 01:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
and for the division I think I just have
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
uh 60 seconds worth of stuff
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
um we we we distributed uh or can we
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
distributed the list last night I think
 
01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
of all of the scheduled events Mr Ripple
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
came up with that uh today I think Janet
 
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
has converted it more to a calendar have
 
01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
you all seen this calendar is this an
 
01:56:33.420 --> 01:56:35.209 align:start position:0%
you all seen this calendar is this an
email

01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
email
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
okay this is this is what I've been
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
hoping for I really like this so so if
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
you'll notice she kind of stopped on
 
01:56:44.510 --> 01:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
March 1st she's she's no she knows she's
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
working on the March calendar too so so
 
01:56:49.250 --> 01:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be able to see them March
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
all the way into the sea here when we
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
have to say goodbye to hb1 to the Senate
 
01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.189 align:start position:0%

but
um

01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%

um and then Wednesday and Thursday you
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
um that's what's up for next week
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
I can just going back to a conversation
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that was held earlier I've received
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
confirmation from Mike Kane that the
 
01:57:38.689 --> 01:57:38.699 align:start position:0%
appropriation in House Bill 2 for the
 
01:57:41.689 --> 01:57:41.699 align:start position:0%
pay raise doesn't does include uh
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
payroll benefits so that is in there
 
01:57:47.330 --> 01:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
and one other thing is
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
I can hand out this summary of
 
01:57:51.169 --> 01:57:51.179 align:start position:0%
Appropriations contained in house built
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
2 since I don't think you'll get the
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
actual document until sometime
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
next week or possibly later but we have
 
01:57:58.850 --> 01:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
gone through and looked at the
 
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so these are the ones
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
if you while you're walking around
 
01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:10.850 align:start position:0%
if you while you're walking around
um

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea who's going to come
 
01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
talk about the prescription drug
 
01:58:25.570 --> 01:58:25.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.570 --> 01:58:28.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative I have also asked that Mr
 
01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
Ripple set up a visit to the sununu
 
01:58:38.330 --> 01:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
center and invite Finance education HHS
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
and public works as other committees who
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
might be interested in seeing the
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
are you speaking specifically when we
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
talk about Sanu Center in the budget or
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
we still have HP 49 we need to dispose
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
of and technically those are two
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
separate things that are sound a lot
 
01:58:57.960 --> 01:58:59.089 align:start position:0%
separate things that are sound a lot
alike

01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
alike
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
understood no just so people who are new
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
to this right who have never been there
 
01:59:06.589 --> 01:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
don't know what the facility is don't
 
01:59:08.330 --> 01:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
know what they do oh you're asking for a
 
01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:11.340 align:start position:0%
tour tour oh I miss that word that's a
 
01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:13.560 align:start position:0%
key word okay and and what kind of
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
response have you gotten I just asked oh
 
01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:17.390 align:start position:0%
response have you gotten I just asked oh
okay

01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
so expect it at some point right there
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
will be a notice that I would like you
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
to send out to everybody right regarding
 
01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
a potential site visit I I think that's
 
01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:29.219 align:start position:0%
a great idea we did that two years ago
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
and and it changed it changed my world
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
the way I looked at the whole issue
 
01:59:36.530 --> 01:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
became very different so we need to go
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
walk the terrain uh representative
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
tolorski with that it doesn't have to be
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
in the near future
 
01:59:44.149 --> 01:59:44.159 align:start position:0%
um I know there's going to be a lot of
 
01:59:45.950 --> 01:59:45.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about the Men's prison coming
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
up in the next couple years and I think
 
01:59:51.109 --> 01:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's something that would be a
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
worthwhile trip for down the road
 
01:59:55.910 --> 01:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we did one of those as well and we
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
can ask for another one because we have
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
new people so yeah that's a good idea
 
02:00:03.770 --> 02:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
and it's incredibly depressing to go
 
02:00:07.010 --> 02:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
into the Men's prison it's just it's
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
nasty because it uh leaks in weird
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
places and because it's a prison you
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
never know what where the moisture for
 
02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:17.219 align:start position:0%
what Puddle came from so it's just it's
 
02:00:20.089 --> 02:00:20.099 align:start position:0%
just it's just nasty and disgusting it's
 
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:22.320 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to protect my uh
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
sensibilities I think we should all
 
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
benefit from seeing the horrible
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
um environment that they're all in I I
 
02:00:30.649 --> 02:00:30.659 align:start position:0%
wouldn't attempt to protect you I would
 
02:00:33.350 --> 02:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
never uh you know assume that you're not
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
a tough person but I just wanted to let
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know it's just it's just nasty it
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
you may want to wear higher pants that
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
day in case it you know so it doesn't
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
drag but
 
02:00:49.070 --> 02:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
um all right I anything else for us
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
no but director ribsum did ask I've
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
already asked him about a tour and he
 
02:00:54.830 --> 02:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
was wondering when you would want to do
 
02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
that during the during the budget
 
02:00:59.209 --> 02:00:59.219 align:start position:0%
deliberations or after well here's the
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
deal it's it's the the visualization is
 
02:01:05.330 --> 02:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
a lot more useful if people see it
 
02:01:07.490 --> 02:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
before they look at the numbers I think
 
02:01:10.550 --> 02:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
so so it's again one of those sooner is
 
02:01:12.830 --> 02:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
better than later and it's probably
 
02:01:14.450 --> 02:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
should have been something I thought of
 
02:01:17.629 --> 02:01:17.639 align:start position:0%
prior to this the budget being released
 
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
but but I I would prefer sooner rather
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
than later
 
02:01:24.169 --> 02:01:24.179 align:start position:0%
if if I were to say something goofy like
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
heck I I'm available on weekends is
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
there an immediate no never or not on a
 
02:01:29.639 --> 02:01:30.770 align:start position:0%
there an immediate no never or not on a
weekend

02:01:30.770 --> 02:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
by anyone
 
02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
because our schedules are filling up
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:01:46.910 --> 02:01:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:49.729 --> 02:01:49.739 align:start position:0%
sorry squeeze the rest of life in in
 
02:01:51.709 --> 02:01:51.719 align:start position:0%
committee work around how sessions
 
02:01:54.169 --> 02:01:54.179 align:start position:0%
becomes really difficult right and then
 
02:01:56.089 --> 02:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
my other committees keep me busy I'm
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
sure everyone's busy so what how do you
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
react to that Mr Ripple I can ask if the
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
department is able to give a tour on a
 
02:02:03.239 --> 02:02:04.669 align:start position:0%
department is able to give a tour on a
weekend

02:02:04.669 --> 02:02:04.679 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just looking to before is there
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
a half day somewhere that we could
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
squeak in a early start or a go a little
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
Friday towards closer to five well maybe
 
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
they'll let us sit down in their
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
cafeteria and have a breakfast with uh
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
we we had been leaving Fridays open this
 
02:02:25.310 --> 02:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
coming Friday you have uh you have
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
presentations but I don't think you have
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
one for the following Friday so we could
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
try that okay I I I have an oversight
 
02:02:35.570 --> 02:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
committee at some point okay HHS
 
02:02:38.570 --> 02:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
oversight out all right I'll let you
 
02:02:41.689 --> 02:02:41.699 align:start position:0%
know which Fridays I know I can't do
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
all right but I've been there so I guess
 
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:45.780 align:start position:0%
you guys can go without me I just like
 
02:02:48.169 --> 02:02:48.179 align:start position:0%
seeing that stuff all right
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
all right turn your mics off and we're
 
02:02:52.080 --> 02:02:54.260 align:start position:0%
all right turn your mics off and we're
done
