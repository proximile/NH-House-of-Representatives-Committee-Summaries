00:08:01.469 --> 00:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
I'm Karen Heber director for the
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
division of economic stability at DHHS
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative F had a
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
questions on this representative Edwards
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I don't have a
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
problem with the transfer I I just want
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
to dip into the eligibility system
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
question in a couple of ways uh one um I
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
I think DHHS overall uses uh New Heights
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
as an eligibility system and I'm reading
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
that there's another system involved
 
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
verify current income that sounds like
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
another it system I
 
00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:40.279 align:start position:0%
I why am I confused are there are there
 
00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:42.519 align:start position:0%
more than one eligibility system or just
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
the one it's the same system okay it's
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
new heights so this is a a module of New
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
Heights or why is there a different name
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
if it's the same thing the system is
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
already in place if the the differen is
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
is that we are now having to pay for
 
00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
this particular service where previously
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
it was paid for by the center for
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services but they Chang to that
 
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
effective June of
 
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
24 okay go ahead um Nathan white Chief
 
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer of the Department of
 
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services during the
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
Senate phase of the budget we um
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
received additional information from the
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
federal government that this system
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
which we were or this particular
 
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
component that we were previously able
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
to use for free now had a cost attached
 
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
to it so we didn't have a discussion
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
about this during the house phase
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
because that was information that came
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
in late during the Senate phase a
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars was added to the
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget because that was our
 
00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:43.230 align:start position:0%
Medicaid budget because that was our
best

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:43.240 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated um guess at that point as
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
far as where it should fall um and the
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
Senate added that money into the
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
operating budget at that phase and then
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
the function of this particular uh
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
request here is to move those dollars
 
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
into the dees budget because after some
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
internal conversations we determined
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
that was where it made the most sense to
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
budget those funds thank you may I have
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
a followup followup um okay so so in
 
00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
this eligibility system is one of the
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
very specific precise verification steps
 
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
including whether or not the person uh
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
uh requesting eligibility is a legal
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that is part of the process
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
within the eligibility determination
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
process that we we do establish that um
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
I can't say that the V the uh this
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
particular component of the system
 
00:10:47.949 --> 00:10:47.959 align:start position:0%
verifies citizen R I'd have to look that
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
up okay so I'd be curious later not
 
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
right now on knowing yes or no do is the
 
00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
it system keeping track of a FL FL that
 
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
indicates that the check on legal status
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
has been made and has been determined to
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
be yes or
 
00:11:10.829 --> 00:11:10.839 align:start position:0%
no I will confirm with you where that
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
lies within the process uh thank you so
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
much and that it's in the it system that
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
it that we're storing the data that's
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
correct all right thank you Mr
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair okay anyone else have any further
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions on the item seeing none I'll
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to adopt the item I
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
so moved
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative Edward moves to adopt the
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
item second by Senator dallesandro is
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion seeing none
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
you ready for the question all in favor
 
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
say I I oppose no the item is adopted
 
00:11:48.069 --> 00:11:48.079 align:start position:0%
we're moving on to now to item two 24230
 
00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
we're moving on to now to item two 24230
next

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
item and I believe the senate had a
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
one Senator rosenal was well I think a
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
number of us had question on this but
 
00:12:13.389 --> 00:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
um I got a very long and thank you mrman
 
00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.949 align:start position:0%
um I got a very long and thank you mrman
yesterday

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
complex explanation of how Nursing
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
Facility rates are
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
set but I understand that it's a
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
combination of patient
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
accurity and
 
00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
cost and the cost includes clinical
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
staff but also administrative cost and I
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
just wondered to what extent having a
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
higher administrative cost is able to
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
drive a higher
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate and the Corel being
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
if if a particular facility's
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is
 
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
lower wouldn't that impact their ability
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
to hire more clinical staff and take
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
residents thank you for the question um
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
the way I would describe it is we have a
 
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
cost-based methodology that's driven off
 
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
a cost report which is somewhat like a
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
complex tax uh form and the um portion
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid costs um there in our rules
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
there are certain limits on certain
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
costs that we'll recognize I do feel
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
like this issue in the long term needs
 
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:39.880 align:start position:0%
to be Revisited because it's been the
 
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
same system for for a long time way
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
before my time um but basically the
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
costs uh are within certain parameters
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
are recognized in the system that and
 
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
then there's also the Medicaid portion
 
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
of cost and then there's a component
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's related to Acuity we measure
 
00:14:00.509 --> 00:14:00.519 align:start position:0%
Acuity two times a year when we're
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
involved in setting the the rate um
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
usually it comes out for January 1 and
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
and July
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
1 um no system of reimbursement is is
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
perfect that they each have some
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses I think the the
 
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
historical cost based reimbursement is
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
in many ways like when you were going
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
through hb2 and and looking at you know
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
how we try to reimburse you know certain
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
areas when you don't have any basis of
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
what the cost it's hard to know whether
 
00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:32.959 align:start position:0%
you're paying adequate rates I do think
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
that um you know we've did one piece of
 
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
migration this past year um which is the
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
Acuity measurement we went consistent
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
with how Medicare does it with respect
 
00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:46.759 align:start position:0%
to measuring the nursing component but
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
there are um potentially some incentives
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
that might be um not exactly what we
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
want I think though um those are some
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
things we want to work on over the next
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
year in terms of you know particular
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
Ally seeing the number of nursing homes
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
that are changing ownership hands and
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
the way that um costs can be stepped up
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
in that kind of transaction base you
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
know we want to pres where we have a
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%
good operator we want to preserve them
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
um and not um you know push them out on
 
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
the other hand we want to be careful
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
direction so we know that some nursing
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
homes that have changed ownership
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
haven't had their rates re-evaluated
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
there's been a pretty long
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
lag with this transfer and the one we
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
did I think last month will those rates
 
00:15:48.749 --> 00:15:48.759 align:start position:0%
now be readjusted or does do these
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
transfers I not help that
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
situation they they would help that
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
situation the only caveat to what I'm
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
saying is if there's another transaction
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
not aware of that's in in play but we
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
have to have a cost report for that
 
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
facility the ones that I think have come
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
up maybe in this past session we're all
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
past that point where we do have a cost
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
report we can work with the F I'll
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
follow up if I could so I I think I've
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
been on this committee continuously for
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
12 years and just
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
yesterday you explained to me that on
 
00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
the dashboard where the nursing home
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh column is called budget it isn't what
 
00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
we've budgeted for but it's a number of
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
licensed beds in the state so I guess my
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
ask is could the department please
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
instead of saying the number of licensed
 
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
beds tell us what we've budgeted
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
for uh so we can look at what the census
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
is versus budget because I know
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the budget neutrality factor is
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
going to come in there somewhere and
 
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.909 align:start position:0%
going to come in there somewhere and
depress

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
depress
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
rates the the column that has the number
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
of beds is the the beds and service the
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
column proceeding it is the actual the
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
number of days that we projected was
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
3398 in the budget um and so we can make
 
00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we can make a footnote change
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
to incl thank you thank you Mr chair sen
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
dandro then Senator line thank you uh
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first of all Henry
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the work that
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
you spent yesterday helping me out
 
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
because we spent almost the whole godamn
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
day trying to figure out what the hell
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
was going on and uh thank you because
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
your perseverance and getting back to me
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
I truly appreciate Pro the problem that
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
seems to have manifested itself his
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
level of expectation was high how did
 
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
how did this level of expectation get
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
out there that these that these nursing
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
homes thought they were going to get a
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
significant significant increase where
 
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
did that come from because all of a
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
calls I think um maybe Nathan and I
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
probably should address that question um
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
but I think in terms of just the um you
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
know what was an hb2 was fully um put
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
into to play and we're actually with the
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
two transfers we're putting more into
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
play but I think in terms of what we've
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
observed in terms of the the draw on the
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
504 count the the pool of what we fund
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
through the budget um I think Nathan you
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
you have some analysis that you've done
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
there sure
 
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.710 align:start position:0%
there sure
um

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
so accounting unit 2152 is the
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
accounting unit through which we make
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
the the class 504 the nursing home
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
payments um there's a special class note
 
00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.789 align:start position:0%
payments um there's a special class note
in

00:18:59.789 --> 00:18:59.799 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
where at the end of the year if there's
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
money left over that we haven't spent
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
then there's the 504 payout um that
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
won't be happening this year I think
 
00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
historically that has always happened uh
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
last may we had to transfer $6.5 million
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
now we're transferring $8 million
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
because what we've seen is just in the
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
past two months after we submitted that
 
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
item our final April numbers came in our
 
00:19:26.549 --> 00:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
final May numbers have come in and
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
they've been 2.5 million plus higher
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
than the prior trending 6 months before
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
that and so we're starting to see an
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
increase and part of that is due to the
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
the increase rate so we're we're
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
starting to see that go up um this year
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
was unique in the sense that the rate
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
setting process which I'm I'm assuming
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
you talked about at at at length
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday was impacted partly by um some
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
of the ownership changes that have have
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
occurred and some of the reporting that
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
we received as well and and uh the the
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
the county and Department um I mean
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
we've met we've talked about that to
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
address those kind of issues in the
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
future and we're trying to implement
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
controls as well um to keep this to not
 
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
have to do transfers going forward in
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
the future one kind of unique Factor as
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
well that we've been seeing this year um
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
we went back and we looked at the
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
history here in 2022 we had about 3.8
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars of back billing um but
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
because we've seen I think it's I think
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
it's something like
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
133% of change of ownership in the
 
00:20:33.909 --> 00:20:33.919 align:start position:0%
facilities this has led to some
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
confusion as well as some late back
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
billing so this year as of the last time
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
I checked a week or two ago we were at
 
00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
about $15.5 million of back billing
 
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
which which is pretty significant
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
compared to Prior years um I we're going
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
to be working with our actuaries for the
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
the next 2627 budget to try to account
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
for some of these variables that that
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
that are uh being affected by the
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
volatility of the the
 
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
ownership it is is one of the problems
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that they have many unfill beds
 
00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
because they can't staff them now I I
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
talked to one nursing home yesterday and
 
00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
they have I guess 25 or 30 unfilled they
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
can't they can't fill the bets because
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
they can't get people what does that do
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
to the to to the rate I mean obviously
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
if you're doing fewer fewer people um
 
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
what does that do to to a quick to a
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
quick fix in terms of how can they how
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
can they do this without falling into
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
into deep deficit because everybody
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
seems to be suffering from from that
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
that situation there there are many beds
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
that can't be filled and and the other
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
aspect that bothers me a little bit is
 
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
this change in ownership that seems to
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
be taking place around around the
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
circuit mean that happens and and it
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
sets this whole process back a little
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
bit because you got to redo this and and
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
you have to redo that is that is that
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
what's happening around the country the
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of um I described as
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
flipping of of facilities and you know
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
we we had conversations earlier in the
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
year about when we get past the session
 
00:22:19.149 --> 00:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
that you know it's one of the things
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
that we want to spend some time
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
evaluating our rules and and our
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
incentives around that um so I do think
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
that that's a factor and as I said we
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
want to we don't want to have
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary churn because it affect it
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
not only affects the finances but the
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
people who are who are receiving the
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
care in the facilities is not Sometimes
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
the best thing um and so um I think we
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
have some work to do there and I think
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
we have some work to do on whether the
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
current system that we have in in terms
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
of um the cost based system whether
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are further adjustments we want to
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
make because the the issue I think that
 
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
with a high inflationary period right is
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
the cost report has to be we use use an
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
audited cost report which means there's
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
a lag sometimes of a couple years in
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
terms of what the costs are you can
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
understand on a cost BAS system you you
 
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
want at least to be able to tie back to
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
the facilities audit you know Financial
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
audit so that you know you have numbers
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
that you can rely on so I think there
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
are some things that we could do but
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
under current rules and current state
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
plan we would have to make some changes
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
and I think those changes need to be you
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
know thought out and we have to go
 
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
through the the process of you know
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
interacting with the industry to to get
 
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on it because some things
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
work better for some and others I'm sure
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
the calls that you got were for the ones
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
that didn't do as well typically as some
 
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
you know some did better than others
 
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
sure it the thing that I saw had the
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
numbers that you gave me yesterday the
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
variance I mean that's in my opinion
 
00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
that's fairly significant yes fairly
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
significant I I don't know I don't know
 
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
happens there's got to be that's got to
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
be looked into I I think because you
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
can't get that kind of a
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
variance because you're all delivered
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
the same service yeah
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
correct off B the basic service you know
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
is some comparable but some facilities
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
take higher Acuity patients and have a
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
need higher Staff to meet those needs um
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
so I I would say that we need to look at
 
00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
this it's not it's not perfect no system
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
is um but uh you know I think in a high
 
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
inflationary period the the lag and
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
recognizing cost is also I think what
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
the what the nursing facilities are are
 
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with in terms of trying to
 
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:43.480 align:start position:0%
meet current budgets that's a problem
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
but but I I don't want to anyway let my
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
colleagues think that you aren't doing
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
an outstanding job because your response
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
to me was UN Target we you got to the
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
basis got right back to me and I got
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
back to to my constituents the problem I
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
see is fundamentally how is all of this
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to work out in in in the future
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
got we got a a serious problem that's
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
out there that that's got to be dealt
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
with it it's going to take money
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
obviously uh to do that but but indeed
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh the Varian has kind of bother me and
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
and the other the other thing that
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
bothers me is the pro- share aspect we
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
were told at a meeting quite some time
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
ago that the pro proch money was was
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
going to be huge now only only that the
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
the uh County nurse sces pick up the
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
prochi now that doesn't run through you
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
does it is is that a direct
 
00:25:45.029 --> 00:25:45.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation or what so um in terms of
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh we used to do proch share through
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
intergovernmental transfers right and um
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire would provide
 
00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
some funding to the to the counties I
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
think two two years into the change in
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
proch share we were told that we
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't do the loaning if you will of
 
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:05.240 align:start position:0%
the money from the from the um from the
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
state treasury to do that it had to be
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
independent from the counties we're
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
still based on other changes we made in
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
the process we're better off than where
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
we were but not as good as that the 18
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
and 19 year um turned out to be um but
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
what we're doing there is um we use the
 
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:29.320 align:start position:0%
cost report again um to now all nursing
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
facilities benefit from the certified
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
public expenditure approach which is
 
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
whatever the Gap is between what
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare would pay and what Medicaid has
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
paid that um CMS will pay 50% of that
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
and no money has to be sort of put up
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
you just make it as a claim in the
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
process um that particular methodology
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
in a high inflationary period is is
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
better because costs are are more
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
readily uh recog recognize but you know
 
00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
the the old days if you will of being
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
able to use the state's money to to
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
start the transaction just is no longer
 
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
considered um in any any uh state to be
 
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.389 align:start position:0%
considered um in any any uh state to be
approved

00:27:12.389 --> 00:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
approved
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
methodology so the complexity of the
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
process is something that we have to
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
deal with we got to deal with as as we
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
as as we move forward uh well things
 
00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
seem to quieten down to some to some
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
degree but but indeed I'm sure my
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues have received the calls uh
 
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.230 align:start position:0%
colleagues have received the calls uh
and

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh do your best to address them thank
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair appreciate that so Lang for
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
a question thank you um so thank you
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
Henry we've taken my question so again
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
my my question I think all of us sitting
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
on my desk right now is from a nursing
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
home in my in my uh District that is
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
asking me about a reimbursement rates
 
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
and B timing of payments um has there
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
been a lag in payments going back to
 
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:55.880 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and is there is there
 
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
systemic reason do it seem like all of
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
us have a similar problem um that in our
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
and we were chatting and we've all got
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
phone calls where either reimbursement
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
rate or the timing of reimbursements are
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
problematic I think um on the timing of
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
payments um there's sort of this uh the
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
challenge of um meeting what I think you
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
want us to do which is to make sure that
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
someone we're paying for is eligible
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
right and some of that can be um complex
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
like having to revie view trusts um need
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
to get information that's not easy for
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
the beneficiaries to do um and we're
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
trying to we're we're working on
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
um changes in our systems and Karen um
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
who was up earlier oversees the unit
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
that we're we're working on things to
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
try to make it easier for facilities and
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
for case managers to be able to help
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
their people those things are going to
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
start to come on I think in the the late
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
summer early fall in terms of the system
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
changes that are being made now
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
to to help them get that the other thing
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
that we had to do just in terms of you
 
00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
know processing applications you know we
 
00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:09.320 align:start position:0%
had to do over 200,000 redeterminations
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
to since they weren't done for years and
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
that's the other thing that we're facing
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
I think you know the public you know we
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
as a state uh you know again we weren't
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
perfect but among states we were I think
 
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
you know among the leaders in terms of
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
getting through the process and getting
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
through it in a as Humane uh way as we
 
00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
could um but I think that you know we
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
have a meeting this week with the um the
 
00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
private nursing home group The New
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire healthare Association uh to
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
talk about their concerns um we're
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
trying to address them we've made we're
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
making adjustments to try to um work
 
00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:48.159 align:start position:0%
better with them um in the end there
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
sort of though this there there is this
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
tension between you know making a
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
determination when you still need
 
00:29:57.269 --> 00:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
information and you know to a certain
 
00:29:59.230 --> 00:29:59.240 align:start position:0%
extent it's better that we sometimes
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
take longer to work things through
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
because as long as the application's
 
00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
open we can go back to the date of the
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
initial application to pay them if we
 
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
deny an application too soon then they
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
lose that start date um and I know that
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
the the nursing facilities are feeling
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
that pressure we're working to try to to
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
to close that gap down I know they would
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
like us to be doing it faster than we
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
are um they have our attention we are
 
00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:29.559 align:start position:0%
working on things um
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
um and I guess all I can say is that
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
that I do think that they're feeling
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of that some of it is just you know
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
trying to care for the them as well in
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
the sense that if we close it too early
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
um you know then they're going to lose
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
that original date to get paid from and
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's not good
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
either one quick followup so again so it
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're addressing it
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
hopefully how long do you think it'll be
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
before we have some movement on either
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
the rate setting or the uh closing the
 
00:30:57.269 --> 00:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
gap between application and and
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
reimbursement because to Senator delis
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
Andre's Point um the longer we don't
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
reimburse them the less money they have
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
to pay employees which means they have
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
less beds available to them and begin we
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
start this downward spiral that because
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
they're not getting reimbursed in a
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
timely manner so I want to be careful we
 
00:31:17.389 --> 00:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
don't crate our nursing home system yes
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
I I think that the rate setting is is
 
00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:21.799 align:start position:0%
we've been on time on that and the rates
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
will get implemented the issue I think
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
is is the completion of a of a initial
 
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.870 align:start position:0%
is is the completion of a of a initial
application

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:31:31.149 --> 00:31:31.159 align:start position:0%
where where we're we've made some
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
improvement in the average time it's
 
00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
still you know we have 90 days to
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
complete what we call a non-mi
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
application those are ones where we have
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
to go to bank records and life insurance
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
policies and so forth versus the ones
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
that are based like the Magi
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
applications which are just based on
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
income those we you know process you
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
know in a short period of time like
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
seven days or less in many instances
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
it's the ones that are the more
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
complicated ones where we have to look
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
at you know sale of a home did was it
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
done you know correctly and all that
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
that uh we're trying to find ways to do
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
that part of the system of care that you
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
um approved last session those have
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
elements to help them like we just
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
implemented on January 1 um an ability
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
to modify the look back period um and
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
also the asset disregards that were a
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
part of that you know that those are
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
things that just are starting to come
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
into play which I think are leading to
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
some improvement there's more that we're
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
do thank you so bir s then Senator Rosen
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you Henry for all
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
your work on this um going back to the
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
the higher Acuity level are those
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and have except the higher
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
acity Acuity level are they getting more
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
of the pie that that's part of the
 
00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
factor that drives it there other
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
factors but that is a factor that you
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
know if you have more nursing hours
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more um more
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and followup follow up um
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
so how do how do we know which
 
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
facilities are accepting the higher
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
acurity levels so um there's a a a
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursement system called um pdpm it's
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
another acronym to throw out there but
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's a basically patient driven uh
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
method of assessing the amount of care
 
00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:32.200 align:start position:0%
that they have in and there's also an
 
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:36.440 align:start position:0%
MDS form which is a standard form both
 
00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
these systems are based off of what
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare does for for doing assessing
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
patients needs and you know more about
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
that than me yes good morning I'm
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
Melissa Hardy I'm the division director
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
for long-term supports and services so
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
all nursing homes use what Henry
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
referenced for the MDS at a minimum data
 
00:33:55.789 --> 00:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
set so it's a clinical assessment for
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
each patient that's done a admission and
 
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:00.200 align:start position:0%
at least quarterly for everybody to
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
measure nursing needs therapy needs um
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
psychosocial needs so it's a
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um Nationwide assessment
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
that every nursing home
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
does is there um a way that we can have
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
access to that information yeah I mean I
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
think we'd be happy to if there are
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
people on the this committee or
 
00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
otherwise to to spend some time with you
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
and get your perspective after we we
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
share that um that's something I
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
certainly offered to to the legislators
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
it's good over time it's been helpful I
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
know on Pro share representative spent
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time with us to to
 
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:40.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we'd be happy to to work
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
with you I'd like to thank you Rosal for
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
Mr does my questions about that
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
90day statutory time
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
limit does that begin when the case is
 
00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.430 align:start position:0%
limit does that begin when the case is
open

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
or after the medical
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
determination is made it's Upon A
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
completed App application um so that's
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
part of the the challenge in terms of
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
When you're counting days the the the
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
term that people tend to talk about is
 
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
pending application that there's a
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
problem with pending applications
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's pending applications where we
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
have everything and we don't complete it
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
within 90 days and under state law if we
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
have a completed application and we
 
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't um do our work within that 90 days
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
that person is deemed eligible whether
 
00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:36.760 align:start position:0%
we completed it or not the issue is the
 
00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
ones where we have challenges on um you
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
know getting records or you know people
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
get frustrated sometimes where we we ask
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
for certain Financial records and they
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
think okay I provided them I should be
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
done but then based on a look at those
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
records we may need we may see something
 
00:35:58.270 --> 00:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
that says we see a transaction
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
we see a life insurance policy we see
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
something that tells us we need to look
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
at something else um and I know that
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
from our state standpoint we want to
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know we want to help
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
those who meet the eligibility but we
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay for those who don't
 
00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
and so I think that there's that tension
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
all the time that we're we're trying to
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
work through and I know as a as a
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
provider when you have someone in your
 
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:23.079 align:start position:0%
facility you want to be
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
paid thank
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
you any further questions on the
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
item entertain a motion to adopt
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
24230 motion by Senator Rosal second by
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
Senator bsel to adopt the item further
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:48.280 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no the item is adopted don't
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.119 --> 00:36:56.030 align:start position:0%
 
four

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
227 okay 227 is uh Human Services
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
authorization to budget and expend 2,530
 
00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
13 and other funds and decreased General
 
00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
funds by
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
2025 thank you Senator Rosen thank you
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
um so I I question this item uh
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
because the uh Department told us that
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
some of the other
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
funds that were supplanting General
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
funds were OB abatement funds and since
 
00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
I chair that
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
commission I am
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
interested uh we have one
 
00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:12.079 align:start position:0%
position that supports that OBO de
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
patment fund that um we've agreed to pay
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
for with obio payment funds but we don't
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
know if the
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
department has ever
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
transferred the op into batement
 
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
in um and I I just want to give a little
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
bit of broader context for this item I
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
will answer your question directly
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
though um the department for the past
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
several years we've been developing um
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
we we call it internally just a budget
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
system and what this new system um that
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
that recently went live is giving us the
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
ability to do is to more accurately
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
identify how we earn funds so those are
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
federal funds or other funds so you
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
probably remember two years ago we had a
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
significant amount of federal funds that
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
we earned that laps that we didn't spend
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have the analytics
 
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:17.960 align:start position:0%
available to easily identify the where
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
we earn those funds this new system is
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
now allowing us to do that and in
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
concert with that um I've internally
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
within the division of finance we've
 
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
reur some of our existing positions to
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
act as uh Business Systems analysts to
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
assign resources to these kind of
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
functions so we can better utilize the
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
funds that are
 
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
available this particular item um this
 
00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:44.359 align:start position:0%
is working with exclusively other funds
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
here U there's Hamstead Hospital opioid
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
a small amount of opioid about 36,000
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
something like that medical cannabis and
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
some ESU dollars here and the purpose of
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
this is to recog ize the costs that have
 
00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
been earned and the department has a
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
public assistance cost allocation plan
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's a several hundred page document and
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
that document is approved by the federal
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
government and we use that document to
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
establish a system of controls for a
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
cost allocation system so that each
 
00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:19.240 align:start position:0%
position earns a small piece of what
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
it's due so to speak so if you look at
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
um the you know some of the division
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
directors or some of the commissioner
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
level positions
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
there's potentially up to 190 or 200
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
different funding sources that are
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
attribute to each of that are attributed
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
to each of those positions um and the
 
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
reason that we do that is to leverage
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
the dollars that are available this
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
particular item is dealing with the
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
other funds and I I checked in with our
 
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
staff on um the discussions at the
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
opioid um
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
commission and one position has been
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
established and then a second position
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
will be established here or it's been
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
established for we're seeking to um to
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
hire right now and as part of those
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
discussions um I believe what was
 
00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
discussed was the indirect cost so what
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
you're seeing in this item is those uh
 
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
small indirect costs being recognized by
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
the executive level positions or in
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
human resources or in doit or in other
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
areas that support the the work of the
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
commission I had a conversation this
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
morning with the deputy AG who
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
said well only the person who's Staffing
 
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:36.309 align:start position:0%
said well only the person who's Staffing
the

00:41:36.309 --> 00:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:39.309 --> 00:41:39.319 align:start position:0%
commission only that position can
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for opioid payment funds no
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
other administrative or
 
00:41:46.079 --> 00:41:47.670 align:start position:0%
other administrative or
executive

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
functions can be
 
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
claimed um to be funded by the op raping
 
00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.069 align:start position:0%
claimed um to be funded by the op raping
Commission

00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
unless the commission votes to expend
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
those funds in that way which we haven't
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
so has the department let let me ask the
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
question again has the department
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
transferred the funds for the one
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
position that we did agree to fund with
 
00:42:23.790 --> 00:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
OPI funds yes I I believe so and and
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
when I spoke to the finance member that
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
attended that um her understanding that
 
00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
that was expressed to the opioid
 
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
commission that the dollars would be
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
used to cover indirect costs through the
 
00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
plan can I follow up please so last week
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
the second position got posted I think
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
it was last week maybe it was the week
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
before I I it's hard to imagine you're
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
going to hire someone before June June
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
30th but that position which has been
 
00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:05.240 align:start position:0%
posted would not
 
00:43:08.109 --> 00:43:08.119 align:start position:0%
exist if it were not for opioid de
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
batement fund so I honestly don't see
 
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
how how you
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
could how the department could
 
00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
imagine that that position the opiod
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
funds could offset General funds because
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
we would never create the
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
position and yet
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
all of this 2 and a half million that
 
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:34.599 align:start position:0%
you're claiming in other funds is being
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
put towards the back of the budget cut
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
to say look we've cut two these $2.5
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
million towards our $23 million back of
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
the budget cut but some of these funds
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
either you haven't been authorized to
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
spend or you haven't incurred them yet
 
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
so so as I said earlier um historically
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
we haven't had this budget tool
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
available to us to easily identify those
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
funds the biggest the largest amount of
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
dollars here is for Hamstead hospital
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
for which when we went into the budget
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a history as far as what
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
would be earned and that's why we're
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
seeking to Tre that up here after we
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
went through this exercise again this is
 
00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:20.319 align:start position:0%
the first time we've ever done this and
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
this will be reflected in the next
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
budget and we also wanted to do this in
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
advance so that when we're looking at
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
the base budget uh we have a complete
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
more accurate year for State fiscal year
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
24 um that that we move forward with
 
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:36.559 align:start position:0%
this before that time frame just for
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
that purpose after we did that we looked
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
at the back of the budget cut you'll see
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
there's the informational item for the
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut for that item we
 
00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
went through every class line that we
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
had we scrubbed them down to see what
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
was available what would lapse um to
 
00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
come up with that figure and then after
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
performing this analysis we said okay
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
well if we're going to be writing these
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
down why why wouldn't we use those
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
towards the required the mandatory
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
required back of the budget cut and then
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
this this exercise here is consistent
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
with the cost allocation plan where
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're recognizing those funds that
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
should be earned so we don't end up in
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
the same scenario where we did a few
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
years ago where we lapsed a significant
 
00:45:18.589 --> 00:45:18.599 align:start position:0%
amount of other and federal funds that
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
were earned that we didn't
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
spend i' like to move to table this item
 
00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:30.839 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I withdraw
 
00:45:30.839 --> 00:45:33.109 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I withdraw
that

00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
withdraw all right we'll we'll have
 
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards question before
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
we entertain your motion thank you thank
 
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
you for your discretion Senator I
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate you holding off on your
 
00:45:49.549 --> 00:45:49.559 align:start position:0%
motion um I I just had a couple tiny
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
questions um you were referring to this
 
00:45:56.549 --> 00:45:56.559 align:start position:0%
um on the front page as the new system
 
00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
and it's meant to track all expenditures
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
by source of funds and program I I think
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
I heard you use a specific name for this
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
new system is there a specific name for
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
this new system so that we know how to
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
talk about it in the future internally
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
we've just been calling it the HHS
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
budget system HHS budget system internal
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay um and then uh in the introduction
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
that sentence it says the department
 
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
entered into a contract in April 2022 I
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
I I don't recall that is is that was
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
that at the discretion of the department
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
or was that directed through legislative
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
action um the contract itself was
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
approved for governor and executive
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
Council I'm not talking about approved
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about who initiated the who
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
who wanted to do the
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
contract it was at the Department's
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
direction to address that sort of
 
00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
long-term issue that we've had where we
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
weren't able to accurately identify
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
where those other or federal funds were
 
00:46:59.910 --> 00:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
earned midy year and then more
 
00:47:02.109 --> 00:47:02.119 align:start position:0%
importantly the system will be used in
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
this year's upcoming budget to more
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
accurately identify the percentage so
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we can better utilize federal funds
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
and offset general fund dollars so so
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
one followup then follow up I I I just
 
00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:16.760 align:start position:0%
want to uh congratulate you and thank
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
you I I often don't sound like I'm uh
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
applauding the work of the department
 
00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:23.559 align:start position:0%
but I am in this case if you took the
 
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:25.960 align:start position:0%
discre or a discretionary action to
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
create a better internal control system
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
and it's it's yielding some Pro probable
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
monies that we can reallocate into the
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
budget I I just think this is really a
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
really great management initiative and
 
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh I want to I want to publicly thank
 
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
you and the commissioner and everyone
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
else that's been involved um and uh and
 
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you um representative
 
00:47:53.069 --> 00:47:53.079 align:start position:0%
Ros this is the last meeting of this
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so depending on how this is
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to affect the budget Bud for this
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year obviously it's the first
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
year of bium and the bium hasn't ended
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
so right that might affect whether we
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
table this or not because we might want
 
00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
to finish up the fiscal year as it's
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
scheduled so move to table okay motion
 
00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
to table this
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
item second second further
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none all in favor say
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%

yeah that's
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
assessment account that you're going to
 
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
use to fund this extension or addition
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
to the contract uh you're curious about
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
what's in the assessment I'm not
 
00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
sure the amount of money that's in
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
the the special utility assessment fund
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
there is no amount of money there's no
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
fund uh the special assessment provision
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
of our enabling statute simply
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
authorizes me
 
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.510 align:start position:0%
authorizes me
to

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh enter into contracts with
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
Consultants that are not already part of
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
my office's budget as long as I bring
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
that request to you for approval and
 
00:51:02.549 --> 00:51:02.559 align:start position:0%
then to governor and councel so that's
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
what I've done
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
here and all of it all of our all of the
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
costs of the office of the consumer
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
Advocate as with the costs of the Pu and
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
the department of energy are ultimately
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh build to the utilities and the
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
utilities in turn recover those costs
 
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
from customers so essentially the
 
00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
customers the utility customers whose
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
interests our office represents
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately pay for us follow uh thanks
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I guess what confused me is
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
that in your on the second page it said
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
the special utility assessment funds if
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're no longer available General
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
funds will not be used so I that's where
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
I get somewhat confused it's a third
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph in your letter to us in the
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
event that special utility assessment
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
I I I don't have a good explanation for
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
why that sentence is worded that way uh
 
00:52:08.349 --> 00:52:08.359 align:start position:0%
I work with the business office of the
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
Department of energy on drafting letters
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
like this to make sure that they meet
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
the technical requirements of the whole
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
process so that's what I did here but
 
00:52:19.789 --> 00:52:19.799 align:start position:0%
the the explanation I've just given you
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
is is I'm pretty sure an
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
accurate characterization of what the
 
00:52:28.589 --> 00:52:28.599 align:start position:0%
financial realities of the situation are
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay I guess it's a nonrelated question
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
that this may be out of your realm but
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
um I know your job is to protect the
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
consumers and the rates as far as
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
electrical rates and all the utility
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
rates we've heard that we're entering a
 
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:45.640 align:start position:0%
period that there may be a a number of
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
hurricanes on the east coast and I was
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
just curious if you had any comment
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
whether our utilities are able to handle
 
00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:56.559 align:start position:0%
a catastrophic event that occurred like
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
in 1938 when people were without power
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
for months if you get into that part of
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
the utilities they prepare to handle
 
00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
major disasters like that and get power
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
restored quickly uh we absolutely do get
 
00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
involved in that and uh I of course I am
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
not a utility executive myself and I
 
00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't supervise the utilities directly
 
00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
but they do have all sorts of very
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
expensive measures in place that are
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
designed to allow the utilities to
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
respond rather quickly to uh major
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
weather related disasters like
 
00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
hurricanes so it is true that if a
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
significant hurricane pass through New
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or the Northeast it would
 
00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
cause outages in the Electric System uh
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
we would expect those to be
 
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
restored uh in the case of a hurricane I
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
would say within a matter of a day or
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
two or three certainly not not weeks or
 
00:54:00.589 --> 00:54:00.599 align:start position:0%
months okay thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
you Senator dallis Sandra for a question
 
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman nice to see you
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
and as always I love the bow tie thank
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
you this is my Winston Church bow tie a
 
00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
classic no question tell I want to ask
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
you just a key question as a consumer
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
why are the trans the uh transmission
 
00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
rates so high and the cost of the
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
product so low it cost twice as much to
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
trans transmit that energy to my home
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
than it does for the energy what what's
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
what's built into the transmission
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
costs uh I think that we as a
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
transmission costs are subject to
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
Federal Regulations so the Federal
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory Commission is tasked
 
00:54:49.589 --> 00:54:49.599 align:start position:0%
with overseeing those rates and assuring
 
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.640 align:start position:0%
that they're just and reasonable within
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the federal power act and
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
I think that to a pretty significant
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
degree the need to conduct the kind of
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
rigorous oversight that that requires
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
has been abreg and as a result there are
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
billions and billions and billions of
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
dollars being spent on transmission
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
projects in New England that are that
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
are really going unreviewed by anybody
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
my office and my counterparts around the
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
region are very very uh concerned about
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
that while we're sitting here there's a
 
00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
body called uh the pack that is talking
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
about a project to spend I think it's
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
something like $400 million rebuilding
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
the transmission line that connects the
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
Coos Loop in the North Country to the
 
00:55:32.309 --> 00:55:32.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the electricity grid I don't
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
think that project should go forward and
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
when you multiply that $400 million
 
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
project by all of the other similar
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
projects around the region you start to
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
understand why we in New England are
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
paying the highest transmission rates of
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
anybody in the country it is without a
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
doubt Senator delandro the most pressing
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
problem that I think my office confronts
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
and we're very concerned about that so
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
it's very astute of you to ask a
 
00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
question about it I look I look at it
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
every month and I can't believe it I I
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
really I can't I can't believe it
 
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:08.319 align:start position:0%
because I I I look at that energy cost
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
and I look at that transmission cost and
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
I say what what what is what is going on
 
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
here uh anyway I I appreciate your
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
comments on it that's something that
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
that uh we as a state we now have a
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
department of energy we should be
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
looking at that because the burden on
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
for those costs is enormous when you
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
when you put it all when you put it all
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
together it's an enormous cost and I I
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
uh look it polls and wires have all have
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
always been contentious in the state
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
right we've been dealing with polls and
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
W for years and years and years well it
 
00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.549 align:start position:0%
W for years and years and years well it
never

00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
never
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
ends some somehow some way somebody has
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
to address that because I think the
 
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
consumer is being short changed I hardly
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
agree thank
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
you I very seldom get agreement so I
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much thank you well
 
00:57:02.589 --> 00:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
if I might even push my luck even
 
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
further Senator dallesandro I was in a
 
00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
hearing the day that you announced your
 
00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
retirement so I didn't get to come down
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
to the state house so I would just like
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
to salute you on your distinguished
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
court move to
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
approve okay motion to approve the item
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
of the second motion was from Senator
 
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
Lang second was from Senator birdell any
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none you ready
 
00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:32.359 align:start position:0%
for the question all in favor of
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
adopting the item say I I oppose no the
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
item is adopted moving on to tab
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
214 and I people have questions Senator
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman commissioner
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
great to see you commissioner as always
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
having been working the budget for a
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
number of years the the overtime the
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
overtime and the vacancy rate continue
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
to bother me uh because the overtime uh
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
puts a lot of pressure on the
 
00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
employee and and uh I look at it and
 
00:58:26.589 --> 00:58:26.599 align:start position:0%
those numbers and dve me PS what 12
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
billion and another 8 billion that's
 
00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:31.160 align:start position:0%
amazing that kind of money is being
 
00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
spent on overtime and you got what a 279
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
person vacancy rate you have about 700
 
00:58:42.109 --> 00:58:42.119 align:start position:0%
almost 800 people it's a 26% vacancy
 
00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
rate now there's got to be uh we we've
 
00:58:49.029 --> 00:58:49.039 align:start position:0%
got to we've got to address that somehow
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
some way somebody's got to address that
 
00:58:54.589 --> 00:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
because that can't that can't go on in
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
my opinion because the people that that
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
are working for you they're burning out
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
they got to be burning out uh working
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
working all of that over time just uh
 
00:59:09.190 --> 00:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
and uh I think it creates a difficult
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
environment I like get a comment on that
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
I've been looking at this for years you
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
know and we've tried we've tried
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
incentives we've tried we've increased
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
the salaries we've done all of all of
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
these things and it it U like it it
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
seems at this point we we're not getting
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
to where we want to
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
be so thank you for that question for
 
00:59:34.829 --> 00:59:34.839 align:start position:0%
the record Helen HKS commissioner of the
 
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections and with me is
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
Lisa Stone our director of
 
00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
administration and uh the cost of
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
overtime uh has increased in general
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
because of the collective bargaining
 
00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:48.920 align:start position:0%
process so the hours themselves cost
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
more um we've actually made great
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
strides in increasing our recruitment
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
specifically of Corrections Officers so
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
when we were at 50% just 6 months ago
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
we've already dropped that down to 46%
 
01:00:03.870 --> 01:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
and that actually matters significantly
 
01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
um the creation of we refer to them as
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
perdum positions um has reduced the
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
burden of the overtime uh fill rate uh
 
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
from our officers to using these
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
positions we created from our lessons
 
01:00:19.109 --> 01:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
learned and using the National Guard so
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
we are reducing the number of times an
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
officer is forced into an overtime spot
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
through use of those resources and
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
relief pool so the uh comments that you
 
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
share about the employee are absolutely
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
our first and foremost uh concerns
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
within the agency is reducing that
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
burden the costs of overtime uh are not
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
controlled from the perspective that
 
01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
bargaining did happen and is
 
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately so paying people uh proper
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
rates for proper service um but we are
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
making good strides uh post the pandemic
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
which was a major hit to the
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
organization in adjusting and improving
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
our uh acquisition of talent and so for
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
example right now uh we are at a we've
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
hired 50 new officers this physical year
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
um and that's significant our retirement
 
01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
rate has gone back to what has been
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
normal for the agency we only had 15
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
people choose to retire in the last 12
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
months and my thanks to the to this
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature and
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
affording us the opportunity to continue
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
to offer that $110,000 incentive through
 
01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:25.240 align:start position:0%
November so all of the work and that's
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
outlined in this ask is is making a
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
difference um and we are improving our
 
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
staffing and I just want to reiterate
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
this is a national Correctional issue
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
and I participate with the correctional
 
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
leadership Association on a recruitment
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
and retention committee and we are
 
01:01:41.789 --> 01:01:41.799 align:start position:0%
mindful that even before the pandemic
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor forecasted a
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
significant decrease in Corrections um
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and and we're trying to fight that
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:55.359 align:start position:0%
state listen I Au I authored the
 
01:01:57.549 --> 01:01:57.559 align:start position:0%
recruitment retened statute that was my
 
01:01:59.789 --> 01:01:59.799 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation now we can only
 
01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
have that in place so long uh because
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
the money is going to run out okay the
 
01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
money is going to so so indeed there's
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
got to be something in place that that a
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
retains people and you seem to be doing
 
01:02:16.109 --> 01:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
a better job with that because your
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
retirements are are less now the money
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
is better the salaries are a better and
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
so forth but but indeed
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
this this situation if it
 
01:02:32.269 --> 01:02:32.279 align:start position:0%
continues you know it's a no wi
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
situation it and we've got to get
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
ourselves out of this no win
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
situation that's that has to happen and
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
on the plate now is a new prison right
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
and that so we're talking about a new
 
01:02:47.870 --> 01:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
prison we're talking about you got 40
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
billion B in the uh as a legislator
 
01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
special to build a prison the consensus
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
I I think that we heard was it's going
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
to cost maybe 400 million to build a
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
building to get it all to together I
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't know if that number that never
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
came about but all all of these all of
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
these things are leading to a
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
situation that that we can't we can't
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
handle it's some way some way somehow
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
this those controls have got to be put
 
01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:21.319 align:start position:0%
in put in place people have to be
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
retained you got to fill the jobs uh and
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
we've got to have some some maintenance
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
there some some
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
predictability and and and some
 
01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:35.240 align:start position:0%
stability I just think U Future
 
01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
legislators can't live with it can't
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
live with the
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
situation it's got to it has to be
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
adjusted we have the we we've had these
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
across the board vacancies in state comp
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
we've been funding ourselves with lapses
 
01:03:52.990 --> 01:03:53.000 align:start position:0%
we've been funding ourselves by filled
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
you know appropriated but not filled
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
position that's how you get a lapse and
 
01:04:01.630 --> 01:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
and these 4% lapses can't exist
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
forever it they just can't in my my in
 
01:04:05.119 --> 01:04:05.829 align:start position:0%
forever it they just can't in my my in
my

01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
opinion this is this is one that I
 
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
really worry about because of the future
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
so just a point that would it make thank
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr J thank you commissioner s Lang
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%

many what was the vacancy High rate for
cosos

01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
cosos
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
total number of vacant positions what
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
what was your high number do you know I
 
01:04:30.799 --> 01:04:32.349 align:start position:0%
what was your high number do you know I
do

01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
know so the high we were at 197 vacant
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
security positions across the agency and
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
now we are I should have printed this in
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
a larger
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%

161 but I'm have to reconfirm that um
 
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:01.400 align:start position:0%
again I appreciate the sentiments of
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
Senator delandro but I believe we

for years now we've taken this very
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
seriously and made great strides um and
 
01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:12.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to do that and
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
the uh support we've received to replace
 
01:05:16.670 --> 01:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state prison for men
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
is part of our retention issue again as
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
I sit comfortably in this room I'm fully
 
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
aware and keep in the Forefront of my
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
mind I have hundreds of staff that are
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
not sitting comfortably are working
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
comfortably in a facility that
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
Foundation was from 1878 and in fact
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
yesterday when I went there in the
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon and walked around and thank my
 
01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
staff for being there and perspired with
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
them I can appreciate the support that
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
we've received to really move that
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
conversation forward um and I I do want
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
to take the opportunity as I did in my
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
capital budget presentation to share
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
with you we're not just taking strides
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
with our staff and building Wellness
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
programs and all of those elements that
 
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
are naturally appropriate for the work
 
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
we do in Corrections but we're also
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the population of people
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and we're reducing our
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate in the state from 2018
 
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
to now we've dropped that rate from 48%
 
01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
down to 41% that's a 7% change in the
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing to help people
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
stay in New Hampshire communities and
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
reduce the population incarcerated in
 
01:06:16.109 --> 01:06:16.119 align:start position:0%
state facilities that also matters we've
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
continued to keep the second floor of
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
our Hancock Building closed because our
 
01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
population has been down reducing 14
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
posts that we don't have to fill so
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
we're very mindful and balanced in the
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing and building those
 
01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
bridges to the New Hampshire communities
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
to help people stay out and if they're
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
not appropriate to stay out they do come
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
back um and we continue to work and
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
improve that process um as I affirmed on
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday our women's facility has made a
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
difference in that recidivism rate it's
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
no surprise to me that women in New
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have a lower recidivism rate
 
01:06:49.829 --> 01:06:49.839 align:start position:0%
than men and some of that is due to the
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal plant changes so again thank you
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
for the support and I affirm for you we
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
continue to work on this
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
issue so you were talking about I'm
 
01:07:02.589 --> 01:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
highly concerned like sen delandra
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
overtime right especially forced
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
overtime in a Corrections Facility where
 
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to create higher burnout
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
rates for our cosos um you were talking
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
about a pum system that was put in a
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
place can you just briefly tell me about
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
that because I I could see where that
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
would dramatically help your um overtime
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
problem yeah thank you Senator we um
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
again learned from our experience with
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
the National Guard in in creating and
 
01:07:25.029 --> 01:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
training people to work in our non-armed
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
control rooms um so what we did is uh so
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
that we do not have to lean on the
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
National Guard in the future is created
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
a a a non-benefited uh relief pool of
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
prum employees um it's done two things
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
for retirees who did not want to
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
maintain their certification as officers
 
01:07:44.269 --> 01:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
they've come back and filled those
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
positions and we've drawn in a new group
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
of individuals whom they're on an actual
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
system where they get a text saying we
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
have posts available and they
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily sign up for those posts um
 
01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that happens across all of our
 
01:07:59.230 --> 01:07:59.240 align:start position:0%
facilities it's been working really
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
great um and it again it creates an
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity not to force an officer to
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
work in a post where we really want our
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
certified Law Enforcement Officers to be
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
working in the housing units and doing
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
that uh uh Frontline work uh with those
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated it's it's a great system
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it's working really well thank you
 
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
discussion representative lean for a
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman I did
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
have just one one question on the
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
retention mapping under technology it
 
01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
says RFID what is
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for that question RFID
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
is a type of technology so that we can
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
get off paper so currently right now
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
when we do a literal count of people in
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
housing units we go around and we our
 
01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
officers are literally checking paper
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
and making sure 64 people or 64 people
 
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
are there this allows us to put
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
technology in the hand hands of our
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
officers and um scan IDs uh to affirm
 
01:09:02.110 --> 01:09:02.120 align:start position:0%
that that person is this person and we
 
01:09:04.510 --> 01:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
can more quickly do our work more
 
01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:06.520 align:start position:0%

um a question about the
 
01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.910 align:start position:0%
um a question about the
dish

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
226 Dash thank you Mr chairman um I had
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
another great conversation the other day
 
01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
with Mr lman who seems to work late into
 
01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
the night and I thank you for
 
01:12:50.189 --> 01:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
that so you told me that the
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
department is working on rate
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
increases for the hospitals that would
 
01:13:01.629 --> 01:13:01.639 align:start position:0%
take place by September 1st so this
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
morning when I came in I rad the letter
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
from the governor
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
dated undated undated that said um that
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
no more than
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
80% of the Met would be returned to
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals in any form form of dish
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
payments or rate increases or any other
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
kinds uh I think you and I discuss that
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
that equates to about $35 million a year
 
01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
cut to hospital so I just my question is
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
the these rate
 
01:13:48.709 --> 01:13:48.719 align:start position:0%
increases are not going to mitigate the
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
$35 million a year cut they're just
 
01:13:55.149 --> 01:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
going to redistribute
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
some of them met from the way we've been
 
01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
years so in in terms of
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
the the way that it's I think the
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
governor's um letter is directing the
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner we're working on a plan
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
that would um I think from a policy
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
perspective start the shift away from
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
Dish um which we're expecting
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh State reductions um all states are
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire is expecting a fairly
 
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
significant reduction and what we're
 
01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pay in dish in the
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
future um so I think the the plan
 
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
Governor's plan that and commissioner's
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
plan that we're working on um will have
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
less less dish but you're right in terms
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
of the um 80% if you based that on this
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
year's met tax which was
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
39.2 would be about about $255 million
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
that 255 would be um you know put in a
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
way that would um support
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
the um if you will the best that we can
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
do in terms of um improving rates for
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals um and uh through either
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
direct rates or through the directed
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
payment mechanism and it would be less
 
01:15:23.149 --> 01:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
dish but the you know the pool of money
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
that's available to pay out is 80% of
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
the uh in this current year by example
 
01:15:35.669 --> 01:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
we had uh we paid up 220 million in dish
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
in in Dish and then the balance to
 
01:15:44.350 --> 01:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
29.4 which is 91% of the the 319 tax
 
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
that the 220 plus um the payments and
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
supplemental and directed payments we
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
made to critical access hospitals equal
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
but so no matter how you slice the
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
pizza um we're still talking about
 
01:16:11.709 --> 01:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
basically this fiscal year a 35 million
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
cut to hospitals you'll just be paying
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
it out differently it won't be all in um
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care some will be in Sub
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
payments not increasing the size of the
 
01:16:36.229 --> 01:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
pie the pi will be from 290 using this
 
01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:40.120 align:start position:0%
year's met tax would be 290 versus 255
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
but the the the benefit of putting into
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
rates and directed payment is that um
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
all from September one assuming
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
governing Council approval of the
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
contract would be from September 1 you
 
01:16:55.629 --> 01:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
know all the way up till the time that
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
they would pay their tax in um in April
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
um they would be getting um you know
 
01:17:05.870 --> 01:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
higher rates um they do then pay the tax
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
in April um but the Dish payment is
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
likely to be
 
01:17:14.950 --> 01:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
lower thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
Senator dandro then representative
 
01:17:19.270 --> 01:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
Edwards oh thank you thank you ju just
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
for clarification H the dish payments
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
have been made for this year correct
 
01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:26.440 align:start position:0%
okay and the money has been returned to
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
the hospitals correct so the deal ends
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
this month it's over the six-year deal
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
that's in place is over so the real
 
01:17:40.229 --> 01:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
problem begins when monies are due in
 
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
April for what what's going to what's
 
01:17:44.430 --> 01:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
going to be there and right now there's
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
nothing there we we' seen
 
01:17:50.510 --> 01:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
proposals by the Senate sen Bradley's
 
01:17:52.950 --> 01:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
proposal I I think that there was some
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
communication with with the house but
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
but at the present time I think people
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
should understand it's done for this
 
01:18:04.270 --> 01:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
year the payments have been made the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
payments have been returned to the
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals the six-year deal is over so
 
01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in place from from this
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
point on it's it's negotiations so
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
either we either have to create it
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislatively or this letter this uh
 
01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
letter that went to the governor or went
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
from the governor to the commissioner
 
01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
grants to the commissioner total
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
authority to go to CMS and ask for plan
 
01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.550 align:start position:0%
authority to go to CMS and ask for plan
change

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:37.239 align:start position:0%
correct so I I think that's the current
 
01:18:37.239 --> 01:18:39.070 align:start position:0%
correct so I I think that's the current
statute

01:18:39.070 --> 01:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:42.199 align:start position:0%
16764 um when had the payment terms
 
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:45.880 align:start position:0%
through 2024 and thereafter that what
 
01:18:47.229 --> 01:18:47.239 align:start position:0%
you said is correct in terms the
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner has discretion in terms of
 
01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
the the plan um in terms of how to use
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
the the tax money so in
 
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
and I say this to my colleagues the
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
legislature has been taken out of the
 
01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
process legislature has no role at this
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
point in time Governor has said to the
 
01:19:08.189 --> 01:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner you will go to CMS ask for
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
a change in the plan and you will ask
 
01:19:15.870 --> 01:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
your your staff to create an 80%
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
deal that's that's what's led the table
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
as we speak now we legislated an
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
arrangement Senator MO
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
I was a party to that to some extent but
 
01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
not to any great but president Mo in the
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislature negotiated this six-year
 
01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
Arrangement that that proved nobody's
 
01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
happy all the time but at least it was
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
satisfactory now we have a situation
 
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
where legislature is totally out of the
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
picture and unless you have a special
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
session or you re or or or reconvene for
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
some reason in January there's nothing
 
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
in place in and my question to to Henry
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
is does does the or do the hospitals
 
01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
have to accept this new Arrangement that
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
you you're working on by virtue of that
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
deban by the governor it go it just goes
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals I mean that's that's not
 
01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's not the legislative process no it
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
isn't that's that's totally disregarding
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the legislator's
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
ability to work this out and we all
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
represent hospitals y all right there
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
are there are critical access hospitals
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
that will be impacted severely and there
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
will be hospitals that will be impacted
 
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
significantly and that's the public that
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the public is served
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
by these
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals think of this it we look at
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
this deal was as a result of a lot of
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
Court action and so forth and so the
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
those of us who were here remember the
 
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
court Rec recognize that but we're we're
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
faced with nothing at this point time
 
01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature has been totally totally
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
left out of the picture I guess it was
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
up to the legislature realizing that the
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
six-year plan was
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
expiring I was not aware of it but if we
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
were we should have done something
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
earlier so it could it could be the law
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
now right well no question conversations
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
have been going have been ongoing yep
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing for a long period for a long
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
period of time it it this is as I I said
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to be here so so uh you
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
know there there's no burden on my
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
shoulders but those of you that are
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
coming back got to figure this out Y and
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
as I
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
said there are 15 critical access
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals that will be affected there
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
are Major Medical centers that will be
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
affected we're talking about a ton of
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
money a ton of money I mean the tax rep
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
was what three 319 million point2 is
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
what the department received from
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
Dr and I mean just and I say to my
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues think about that y because we
 
01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
we we have a
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility we've got a
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility people elected us to
 
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:26.920 align:start position:0%
serve them the best possible fashion th
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
this is something I've never seen before
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
I've never seen anything like this
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
before really bothers me at this at at
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
this point in time to see this this
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
happening uh and uh We've made we' made
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
big strides look at we talked about the
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
first year we had a budget that we
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
everybody loved everybody passed it we
 
01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
were dancing in the streets the first
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
year and we're hanging ourselves in the
 
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.830 align:start position:0%
year and we're hanging ourselves in the
second

01:22:52.830 --> 01:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
year doesn't doesn't make any sense to
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
me just doesn't make any sense it as I
 
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
said to my colleagues who are coming
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
back you got to face this y thank you Mr
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
CH thank you for your work represent Ed
 
01:23:11.390 --> 01:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you I I I had another
 
01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make but in um in
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
response to the Senator's comments I I I
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say as a member of the
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
commit a conference that dealt with this
 
01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
issue at the last minute um I I apply
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley for all the work he did
 
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
trying to bring the hospitals together
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
with the department and and and with
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
with the other Senators uh unfortunately
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
that process had trouble getting over
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
the U goal line because the the the
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
house process had been left out of it no
 
01:23:45.030 --> 01:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
no the the house committees the policy
 
01:23:46.669 --> 01:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
committees Finance Committees of the
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
house never had an opportunity to see a
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
regular bill so at the end of the day we
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
were asking four rep Representatives out
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
of 400 to basically cut a deal at the
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
last minute without having been involved
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
and so so I I I think the legislature
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
can do and needs to do a better job but
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
but there's something in place the the
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner has a a a directive
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the governor to put together a plan
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
and to and to work it out and I think
 
01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
that's uh what's being done I so I I I I
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't want because the department is
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
sitting in front of us I don't want it
 
01:24:28.910 --> 01:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
to look to the public like the
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
department has let us down I think we
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
just sort of uh didn't get it we didn't
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
get it done when it needed to get done
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's on us but um the um the
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to can I go to my main
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
point certainly uh thank you and this
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
this may be uh for Dr hen uh in part um
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:24:57.310 --> 01:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
there's been discussion
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
about H I'm talking about item
 
01:25:05.109 --> 01:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
226 the statistical summary I I I don't
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
know what the process is that we use to
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
add a table or add information to a
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
table well you know to formally request
 
01:25:17.189 --> 01:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
one but I would really like to see a
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
proposal from the Department to add a
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
table to the statistical document here
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
that gives us a nice snapshot of what's
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
going on at Hamstead and
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we've got uh patients we're
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
seeing we've got vacancies we're trying
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
to fulfill and then we have the issues
 
01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
with the local community and and calling
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
in emergency services on an ad hoc basis
 
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and and that third component is is
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
really important for the legislature to
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
have visibility on because it obviously
 
01:25:54.430 --> 01:25:54.440 align:start position:0%
is a Hot Topic in that community and
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
drives things like uh fiscal requests to
 
01:26:00.189 --> 01:26:00.199 align:start position:0%
transfer money and to solve
 
01:26:03.070 --> 01:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure problems and it you know
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
causes us to know whether we should be
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the payment in Li of taxes so
 
01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
so I would like if you could uh develop
 
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
and propose a table that would be a nice
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hamstead snapshot and I've mentioned
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
like three things that could be in it
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
but but I'll leave it to you you're
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
you're the PhD um the uh I don't know if
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
table 12 intends to already try to
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
capture that somehow but as I'm reading
 
01:26:34.669 --> 01:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
the columns I'm not seeing a Hamstead
 
01:26:37.149 --> 01:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
column so
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh uh thank you for the for the idea
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
and the recommendation and I'll just
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
note that under um Senator bird cell's
 
01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
leadership the YDC impact commission um
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
we've been able to bring together a lot
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
of key players in better analyzing this
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
data to understand the impacts to the
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
town incl including um as you know uh
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
visits by by police and First Responders
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
which I may Note have um knock on would
 
01:27:04.830 --> 01:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh reduce significantly as we seek a
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
period of stability so I think what I
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
hear you asking for is to is to show
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
that data and um one of the things
 
01:27:13.149 --> 01:27:13.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Bell has encouraged us to do is
 
01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
to work as a department with the local
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
First Responders to make sure we're
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
essentially counting the same units and
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
agreeing on a methodology there so as
 
01:27:22.990 --> 01:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
soon as we uh come up with that
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
methodology this summer would be happy
 
01:27:28.030 --> 01:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
to uh put together some options thank
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
you Senator gon thank you um and I I
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
haven't forgotten the fact that I I need
 
01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
to contact the chief of police to make
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
sure that you guys get together
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
to connect so that you have the same
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
numbers okay and we should also consider
 
01:27:49.109 --> 01:27:49.119 align:start position:0%
that the alternative is that the YDC
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
would have to provide its own security
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
force and that would be far more money
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
than what we're asking
 
01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
be to be given to Hamstead so keep that
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
in mind if if we're not going to get
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
that payment to Hamstead then we're
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
going to request a security Force at the
 
01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
YDC so so Mr chair if I may I because
 
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
I've been struggling to make sure the
 
01:28:13.310 --> 01:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
community understands the distinction
 
01:28:15.870 --> 01:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
that the YDC is a separate entity from
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
Hamet hospital and although they're
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
co-located to share Services we've
 
01:28:22.669 --> 01:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
already designed or intended to design
 
01:28:25.149 --> 01:28:25.159 align:start position:0%
the YDC with the man power necessary to
 
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
provide their own internal security the
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
issue is we're putting it next to
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital which has come under a
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
rash of of issues over the last 15
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
months and so so if we have to beef up
 
01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
the internal security of one of those
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
facilities it would be Hamstead not yet
 
01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:43.639 align:start position:0%
the YDC because we've not seen the
 
01:28:47.310 --> 01:28:47.320 align:start position:0%
Personnel plan for YDC yet thank
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
you further discussion Senator rosenal
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to follow up on
 
01:28:56.510 --> 01:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Dallas 's comments I mean I
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
think we've known since
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
2018 that the settlement on the Met was
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
going to expire at the end of this
 
01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
month um
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
is I thought about this term as it being
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
one of the two major things we had to
 
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish the other one being
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
reauthorizing Medicaid expansion we got
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
that done
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
last fall we started having
 
01:29:32.790 --> 01:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
conversations within the senate
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
about the need to get something in place
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
and at that time the
 
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
governor said apparently that he wanted
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to put together a
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
small working group to make progress on
 
01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
this I I don't know if that ever
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
happened I was not part of it
 
01:30:06.629 --> 01:30:06.639 align:start position:0%
um it would have obviously been better
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
if negotiations had proceeded in time
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
for a late filed bill that would meet
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
the deadlines but they didn't so as
 
01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.390 align:start position:0%
the deadlines but they didn't so as
often

01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
often
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
happens and is consistent with both
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
Senate and House
 
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
Rules uh an amendment was put onto a
 
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:35.080 align:start position:0%
house bill that was Germaine because it
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
was in the Senate version I wish I had
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
been part of these negotiations I wasn't
 
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
I thought the plan the Senate sent over
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
was reasonable but I I just I mean there
 
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
have been times where we've inserted
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
policy into House Bill 2 during
 
01:31:01.350 --> 01:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
Committee of conference where nobody's
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
had a public
 
01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:08.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and so I don't think that
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
sending um the dish settlement over on a
 
01:31:15.750 --> 01:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:31:21.629 --> 01:31:21.639 align:start position:0%
was um very unusual from the way the
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislative process happens but but all
 
01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
that being said I think a $35 million
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
cut a year to hospitals well we know
 
01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
that at least 17 of the 26 hospitals are
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
going to be in the red is really
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
problematic for the people who live in
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because hospitals are the
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
backbone of our health care System they
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
um are responsible for a lot of the
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
outpatient care as well as the inpatient
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
care and they're also huge employers and
 
01:32:05.229 --> 01:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
they have the inability to move so they
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
can't pick up and move we need them
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're spread all over the North
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
country and western New Hampshire and
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about the impact of a
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
$35 million a year cut and that
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
considering that just this year when
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
we've gotten the tax payment from the
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you further
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Edwards so so
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
the four out of the 400 were really
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
close to the what the Senate position
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
turned out to be we were 5.72 million
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
apart which was not too bad given the
 
01:32:55.709 --> 01:32:55.719 align:start position:0%
fact that we've been left out of the
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
policy and finance part of the process
 
01:33:01.390 --> 01:33:01.400 align:start position:0%
it just sometimes things just don't
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
happen and and this was one of those
 
01:33:05.390 --> 01:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
times where the legislature failed and
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we want to come back if you're coming
 
01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
back next year and I'm back next year
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to to to do a bill uh we
 
01:33:16.709 --> 01:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
have Senator Bradley's work to draw from
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
better further
 
01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
discussion Senator
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
d i I think the representative remarks
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
consistent we got to do
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
better but I represent one of the larger
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state 2,000 employees
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh in Manchester 2,000
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
employees a negative economic impact on
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
the institution that I'm represent has a
 
01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
devastating effect of those employees
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
but what about the people we serve in
 
01:34:00.870 --> 01:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
the immediate area now we had a six-year
 
01:34:02.109 --> 01:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
deal in
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
place I mean there wasn't anybody in
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
this legislature who didn't understand
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
when the deal expires the deal
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
expires I was not made aware of it well
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
those who worked on it were certainly
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
aware of it and
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
U I I I think uh it's in
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
on on us it's incumbent upon us to bring
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
this issue forward why couldn't it have
 
01:34:35.229 --> 01:34:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
extended I I I wasn't I wasn't part of
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:34:45.030 --> 01:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh I think the fact of the matter is
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
it's getting all kinds of noise now yeah
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
all kinds of noise and that that's not
 
01:34:53.270 --> 01:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
not good for the hospitals it's not good
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
constituents it it it makes us look bad
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the Public's View and I think that's
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
terrible we have the third largest
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
legislative body in the englishspeaking
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
world and we can't get anything
 
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
done 400 members of the House 2 members
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
of the of the Senate it in this issue as
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
my colleague to pointed out look
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
at look at the people uh that affected
 
01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.669 align:start position:0%
at look at the people uh that affected
by

01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
this I think it's I think it's quite
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
dramatic to be honest with you and and
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's an ongoing dietr between between
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
the executive and I don't know who at
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
this point time because it's a mystery
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's the hospitals that that
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
that isn't that isn't helping anybody
 
01:35:46.709 --> 01:35:46.719 align:start position:0%
all the problems we've discussed are as
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
a result of ridiculous
 
01:35:51.149 --> 01:35:51.159 align:start position:0%
inflation until something is done about
 
01:35:54.310 --> 01:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
that these problems will persist well
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
just uh good luck that's all I have to
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
say yeah Senator Rosal thank you I
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
actually asked if we could just extend
 
01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:07.239 align:start position:0%
the current program and was told that we
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't because the Federal Regulations
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
around dish have changed so we really
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have better options but now we're
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
faced I think with something that is
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
potentially damaging to
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
people um and could wind up in more
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
litigation that we've already
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
lost which led to the settlements in the
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
first place having been involved with
 
01:36:42.030 --> 01:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
the me since its
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
beginning all the money that came in
 
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
from me all went back to the hospitals
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
they were happy we got a match from the
 
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
feds we got to spend it as we wanted
 
01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:54.550 align:start position:0%
feds we got to spend it as we wanted
then

01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
we were giving it back to the hospital
 
01:36:59.550 --> 01:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
all of it and then the
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals because of the MMS said wait a
 
01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
minute you can't pay them back for this
 
01:37:07.870 --> 01:37:07.880 align:start position:0%
because they didn't cross this te or Dr
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
dot this eye or whatever they their
 
01:37:12.669 --> 01:37:12.679 align:start position:0%
rules we were giving them back too much
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
so that's when we had to reduce it
 
01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
because of the federal
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
rules so that was what tied a lot of it
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
up and it's the same thing again when we
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
try to say give us the money and the tax
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
we'll give it back to you the feds will
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
match it we'll all be happy the feds
 
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
won't match it if they if they say you
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have paid them back for this
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
that's where the problem came from is
 
01:37:37.870 --> 01:37:37.880 align:start position:0%
from the feds so Senator Lang thank you
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair again I'm not going to look
 
01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:40.599 align:start position:0%
backwards because we can't do anything
 
01:37:42.030 --> 01:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
about what's already happened we only
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
look forward and I'll just remind um all
 
01:37:47.149 --> 01:37:47.159 align:start position:0%
of us that it's not uncommon for us to
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
look at beo day and come to an agreement
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
by VTO day um if you remember a couple
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
of years ago we did that for we in out
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
an energy crisis and we're in the middle
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
of Co and people had no jobs and we
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
ended up putting $36 million aside to be
 
01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
able to help people keep their lights on
 
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't mean it's closed for the
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
year if people are willing to sit down
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
and work we can bring a bill forward on
 
01:38:09.669 --> 01:38:09.679 align:start position:0%
veto day if we can suspend the rules and
 
01:38:11.950 --> 01:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
move it forward so I just it it's not
 
01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily completely dead um but it's
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
going to take a willingness of everyone
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
to sit down and have conversation and
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
get to a solution that can be dealt
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
within one day on veto day so and
 
01:38:23.589 --> 01:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
remember the Senate has more flexib
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
ility in introducing legislation than
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
the house has so we'll rely on my
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues over on that side again but
 
01:38:33.109 --> 01:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
it it goes back to Senator Edward's
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
point that there's policy committees and
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal committees that want to have an
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
input and conversation in this and then
 
01:38:40.950 --> 01:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't do us any good at the
 
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
Senate int does wave the rules and
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
introduces something only to have the
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
house say no we're going to do the same
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
outcome as the commedia conference we're
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to kill it because we don't want
 
01:38:51.109 --> 01:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
because we weren't involved so I all I'm
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
saying is I want to remind the issue is
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
not necessar dead there is an
 
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity forward to go forward and we
 
01:38:59.109 --> 01:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
should try to look I know I have my
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
Hospital in my a couple of my hospitals
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
in my area are losing money on on this
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
deal right so again I I'm eager to see a
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
solution go forward um that that that is
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
good um because again when our hospitals
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
don't have the money they need to
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
operate all of our constituents suffer
 
01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
so we need a solution for this and not
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
and not just be angry because I wasn't
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
involved or we anything else so thank
 
01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:26.679 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:39:28.990 --> 01:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
discussion it takes more than just the
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
legislature to play in this game yes
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
yeah the the information should have
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
been brought to
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
us with some urgency but it wasn't so do
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
we have anything further in the
 
01:39:43.229 --> 01:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous items that people would
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
like to discuss seeing none then the
 
01:39:49.229 --> 01:39:49.239 align:start position:0%
next item would be to choose our next
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
meeting we're coming toward the end of a
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year which ends in in just a few
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
days so we've done all the
 
01:39:58.830 --> 01:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
rearrangements for all the Departments
 
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
where they wanted to balance their
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
budget and that's been a big part of our
 
01:40:04.870 --> 01:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
last two months so that should have been
 
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
settled um going forward we don't always
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
meet in July and we don't always meet in
 
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
August ask the the commissioner of
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
administrative Services if he thinks
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
there would be anything pressing in
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh the first two months of the fiscal
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
year are better um I don't know of
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
anything pressing that might come up the
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
only thing I would tell you is that
 
01:40:39.589 --> 01:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
something pressing might come
 
01:40:42.109 --> 01:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
up if it does but I don't know of
 
01:40:43.550 --> 01:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
anything right now but I there's
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
certainly no uh the the legislature is
 
01:40:49.109 --> 01:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
historically skipped at least one of
 
01:40:50.709 --> 01:40:50.719 align:start position:0%
those two meetings without everything
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
falling apart um I maybe you could
 
01:40:57.070 --> 01:40:57.080 align:start position:0%
consider I don't want to tell you what
 
01:41:00.149 --> 01:41:00.159 align:start position:0%
to do U maybe you could consider not
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
doing one of the meetings and uh and
 
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
waiting to make your mind up on whether
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
later so I don't want to get in trouble
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
with other agencies who go well you just
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
told me they didn't have to meet and now
 
01:41:17.229 --> 01:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
I got a thing we will we will
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
tentatively with the permission of the
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee I suggest we skip July
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
tentatively set a date in August but if
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
we don't hear enough to have a
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
meeting then we'll cancel August and
 
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably plan as one of my colleagues
 
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
pointed out everybody should be around
 
01:41:40.229 --> 01:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
by September 10th for the for the
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
primary so if we have it within that
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
next the week following the primary we
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
should have everybody here even those
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
that wanted to take vacations and be
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
miles away and not not attend um that
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
that may work so tentatively what would
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
be the date in August if we went
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
September 13 uh so the August date if
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
tentative August would the third Friday
 
01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
is August 16th and then September if you
 
01:42:09.510 --> 01:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
do the Friday after primary would be
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
September 13th so the date again in
 
01:42:15.750 --> 01:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
August would be 16th 16th
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
so let's set a tentative date for August
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
16th with the possibility that within
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
the week before or perhaps further than
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
that out than that I will notify you if
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
01:42:36.870 --> 01:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
meeting 10
 
01:42:41.390 --> 01:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
a say that again 10 a.m 10:00 a.m. as
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
usual and if we don't have any air
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
conditioning we'll rely on the on the
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
Senate to host us again in an air
 
01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.070 align:start position:0%
Senate to host us again in an air
conditioned

01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
conditioned
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
room so

01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
urgency um we may go
