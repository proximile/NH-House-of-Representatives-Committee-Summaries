00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm letting them in thank you
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then after we do house bill 626
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go into the dra
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
related ones because we have
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
members from the dra which are in
 
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.350 align:start position:0%
members from the dra which are in
attendance

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to answer questions from
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 10 i'm going to hold that
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
so we will start with house bill 626
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
six bills house bill 626
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
and that relative to historic horse
 
00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:52.710 align:start position:0%
and that relative to historic horse
racing

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor on that
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative doucet
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
a member of the committee is also on
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
and a number of others
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
so the discussion the starting was up to
 
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.469 align:start position:0%
so the discussion the starting was up to
me

00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
he wants to start the discussion on rep
 
00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you on i want
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
why this bill
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
and this new initiative in
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
fairly major gambling
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
on is does not allow
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
the local option that is
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
provided in keno and provided in sports
 
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.670 align:start position:0%
provided in keno and provided in sports
betting

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
betting
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
last term when this came through on
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
as chair i was pretty limited in
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
asking things and um
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
it was a total
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
surprise to me when i was told that we
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
don't do this
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
well we did in the last two years before
 
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:35.670 align:start position:0%
well we did in the last two years before
that

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
do this and um
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
i would there because it has been put
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
within charitable gaming statute
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
but is also linked to the racing statute
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
on it goes um
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's taking the most freedoms
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
for this activity uh
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
individual freedoms on
 
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the charitable gaming
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
but it is actually an activity
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
which would normally be considered to be
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
in a totally new chapter all by itself
 
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:20.389 align:start position:0%
in a totally new chapter all by itself
because

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
it is uh quite a departure from
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
everything that has been considered
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in the past and
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
i would like to know uh
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
whether um people would be willing
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
to support putting a local
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
option for this activity
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
as you know charitable gaming has been
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
around for almost a decade and a half
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
there's never ever been a local option
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
having to do with charitable gaming
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
these organizations have sprouted up
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
there's 16 of 16 of them now throughout
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
playing variety of games from
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
craps to roulette to
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
and not once
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
has a community ever voted on any of
 
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.990 align:start position:0%
has a community ever voted on any of
those

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
on any of those whether it be poker
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
or whether it be roulette or whatever
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
now keno and i was involved in the
 
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.630 align:start position:0%
now keno and i was involved in the
keynote

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
keynote
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
and actually i i insisted on
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
an opt-in up for that way back when
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
because it was a different kind of
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
facility it was
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
a a restaurant
 
00:12:02.949 --> 00:12:02.959 align:start position:0%
that poured liquor and that was
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
different enough
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
that we said we should have an opt-in
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
by the community for keno
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that has gone on and has been
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
that past and many communities have
 
00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.069 align:start position:0%
that past and many communities have
since

00:12:20.069 --> 00:12:20.079 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
voted in uh the local option for that
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
but all we're doing with this bill back
 
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.430 align:start position:0%
but all we're doing with this bill back
to

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
historic racing is adding another game
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
to the portfolio of games that already
 
00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:37.110 align:start position:0%
to the portfolio of games that already
exist

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
so uh within charitable gaming
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why i do not think it's
 
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
and that's why i do not think it's
appropriate

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
to to have this option
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
now mr chair
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
mr chair representative ames
 
00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to speak speak on that
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
question um in response to
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
what representative romney just said
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
i think there's a difference here
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
the horse racing machines that we're
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh bring a scale to charitable gaming
 
00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.829 align:start position:0%
uh bring a scale to charitable gaming
that's

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
unprecedented uh we're talking about
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
on average according to the fiscal note
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note of course is a
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
guesstimate but they used 1 000 machines
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
statewide as basis for the estimate
 
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
you divide that by 16. and you get about
 
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:35.829 align:start position:0%
you divide that by 16. and you get about
60

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
60
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
odd machines per site but it's going to
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
be uneven they're going to be some with
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
much more many more and some with less
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's a big hit for a local community
 
00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.910 align:start position:0%
that's a big hit for a local community
and

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a question of
 
00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:55.670 align:start position:0%
that should be
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
that should be
[Music]

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
answered it's it's the placement of a
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
facility with
 
00:14:06.389 --> 00:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
those machines in it is a
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
is a matter that should be i think
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
put to the local voters to see whether
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
agree that it's okay it's very different
 
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.350 align:start position:0%
agree that it's okay it's very different
from

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
keno very different from anything else
 
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
keno very different from anything else
that

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
we've talked about and
 
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
for kino now sports betting we have
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
local options
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
why not for this i don't understand it
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we're talking by the way
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of scale i mentioned a thousand
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
machines the fiscal
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
note also points out that if that's the
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
number of machines we're gonna have 550
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars flowing through
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
um those 16 locations
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money it's a lot of
 
00:14:51.839 --> 00:14:52.790 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of money it's a lot of
money

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so one more
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
difference between this proposal and
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
that's involved with uh related to
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh respond to that mr chair could i
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
respond first
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
i did have my hand up with me
 
00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay followed by representative romney
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you on we have been very careful
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
over the years in charitable gaming they
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
have come to us
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
with requests for machines
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
the major difference of a machine from
 
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.990 align:start position:0%
the major difference of a machine from
the

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
poker and the roulette and the the
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
craps is that
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
there is only an interaction between an
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
individual person
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
and a machine not the social component
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
that is found
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
in re in what used to be charitable
 
00:15:53.839 --> 00:15:54.470 align:start position:0%
in re in what used to be charitable
gaming

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
and what on when we have had machine
 
00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.189 align:start position:0%
and what on when we have had machine
requests

00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
when we have granted them we have been
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
very careful
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
to circumscribe them enough actually
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
people running large gambling
 
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.310 align:start position:0%
people running large gambling
establishments

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
uh wanted keep coming back to say
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
let us get rid of these circumstances
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
and we have said no
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
because they were meant to just be
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
a convenience not something that would
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
draw someone in to spend all of their
 
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:27.670 align:start position:0%
draw someone in to spend all of their
time

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
in front of that machine on
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
these are
 
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
a class of machine
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
which is set up
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to keep someone
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
on the machine as long as possible
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
and gambling as quickly as possible
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
on that creates
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
more problems with people who lose
 
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
all of their money they are not a very
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
large percentage
 
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
of the people that use those machines
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
because most people
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
on do not addict
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
but the closer you live to these places
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
the more you addict the more likely you
 
00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:18.789 align:start position:0%
the more you addict the more likely you
addict

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
addict
 
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
and there are communities where
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is considered to be not so much
 
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
this is considered to be not so much
problem

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
one it's in the culture two
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
on it's serving a very
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
very large area of people um
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
there are also communities that now have
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
where this is a huge problem because
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
as in my community they have been the
 
00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
poker room has been put
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
subsidized housing and the housing for
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
recovering from substance abuse uh the
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
housing of elder people
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
who don't have much to do in their lives
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and don't have enough enough money
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
probably to last for very long without
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
ending up
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
in the county on nursing home
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
and so communities
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
communities need to have some kind of
 
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.789 align:start position:0%
communities need to have some kind of
say

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
in this major difference from what we
 
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
have been doing
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
so far thank you thank you
 
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
so far thank you thank you
representative

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative okay three things
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh first let's not forget that we in
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
many of these
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
establishments already have lucky seven
 
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
establishments already have lucky seven
machines

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
which are mechanical devices that take
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
bets just like these
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh and some of them have
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
some have 30 30 35 of these machines
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
in a facility uh so this is not the
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
first time
 
00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's mechanical devices uh
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we neglect to talk
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
about we haven't talked about
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
was that many communities use ordinances
 
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
when it comes to regulating its their
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
salem salem is a great example of that
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
they indicate where in the community
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted to see charitable gaming
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh so there are mechanisms that
 
00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
exist to monitor or to
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
place within a community uh charitable
 
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.510 align:start position:0%
place within a community uh charitable
gaming

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are that already are uh
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
a town can avail themselves to
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
now as far as the machines themselves
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
and talking to charlie mcintyre over the
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
years he always says
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing for him to maintain
 
00:19:58.150 --> 00:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
our machines
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's harder for him to maintain and and
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
monitor poker
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
to monitor the crap stable
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
because there's human beings involved
 
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.390 align:start position:0%
because there's human beings involved
interacting

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
interacting
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
not just the machine and maybe
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps mr mr chair perhaps
 
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
we can have charlie just chime in a
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
second on that the whole issue of
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
his ability to oversee this
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
and uh comparing it to
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
other other games of chance that he has
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
and monitor would that be okay yes
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
charlie charlie mcintyre
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes good morning mr chair members of the
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
committee hi charlie mcintyre
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
i'm at my office in concord with me is
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
our chief compliance officer
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh john conforti who's been before the
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
you heard what the discussion was
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the machines
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
i did i did um one of the things
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
the technology exists certainly to
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
monitor the machines in real time
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh similar to what we do with lottery
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
terminals and they are the
 
00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
from the purposes of a regulatory
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint the easiest to maintain
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
and one of the things i wanted to
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
comment on that we said earlier is
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
while the fiscal note contains a very
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
large number
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's not the amount of money that goes
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
into the machine that's the amount of
 
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
into the machine that's the amount of
money

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
a play that exists and what i mean by
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
that is if you put ten dollars into a
 
00:21:31.679 --> 00:21:33.350 align:start position:0%
that is if you put ten dollars into a
terminal

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
terminal
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately you're going to play probably
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere between
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
forty fifty dollars worth of play sixty
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of play
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
seventy a significant number above the
 
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
amount you put
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
in before that money is exhausted so
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
really what we generally concern
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves with is what's left at the end
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
of the day
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
that remains in the machine and
 
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.070 align:start position:0%
that remains in the machine and
similarly

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
similarly
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
i'll use the analogy to sports betting
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
um sports betting will do oh probably
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
600 million dollars full year in sports
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
betting activity
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not like 600 million dollars is
 
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
passed through our term
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
our machines it's really you know the
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
same fifty dollars is going back and
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
forth across people who bet
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it's you know i bet fifty dollars
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
and representative measurement sixty
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
dollars in the same game
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
on opposite sides one fifty dollars has
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
gone from one account to another account
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
um so similarly the machines themselves
 
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.310 align:start position:0%
um so similarly the machines themselves
don't

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
get all of that money it's not like
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
someone puts in hundreds of millions of
 
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.630 align:start position:0%
someone puts in hundreds of millions of
dollars

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're putting in millions there's no
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
question but it's
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
if you're playing you're said depositing
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
ten dollars
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
you you better you better quarter you
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
win 10 cents back you bet a quarter
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
again you win 50 cents back
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
you lose three times you lose 75 cents
 
00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:48.559 align:start position:0%
so it's this constant play
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
that makes it a much larger number than
 
00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like if that and
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
so for our purposes um
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know i we're giant fans of
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
technologies you can imagine they're far
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
more easy to monitor to answer your
 
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
more easy to monitor to answer your
question

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman well thank you charlie
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions about
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
charlie's yes i
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
i do representative ames
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
yeah uh related to what you just
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put together several
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
questions and i think it's easier for
 
00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:19.669 align:start position:0%
questions and i think it's easier for
you

00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
to answer these but um related to your
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
point about the
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
the actual amount being less than that
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
545 million dollars
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
that that i had mentioned
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
fair enough but it is still a lot of
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
money and i think you said that
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh and i'd like
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
way in which you ensure that that that
 
00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.350 align:start position:0%
way in which you ensure that that that
money

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
is managed appropriately it's more than
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
just the machine
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's there's a lot of money um
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is uh maybe it's
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
our credit card's being used i don't
 
00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
know maybe you could go into all that
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
question of how the money gets played
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
related to this money question is your
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal note
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
and in the fiscal note you uh you used
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
a thousand machines as your takeoff
 
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
a thousand machines as your takeoff
point

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
um this and that's the same
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the same note as you
 
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
and it's basically the same note as you
did

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
two years ago for the bill that was then
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
put forward on the same issue
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
and this year we've got a bill that has
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
a debt limit of 25
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
at that time the bet limit was 10
 
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.990 align:start position:0%
at that time the bet limit was 10
dollars

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see any adjustment for that in
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
your fiscal note
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
um is that uh because it doesn't need to
 
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.149 align:start position:0%
um is that uh because it doesn't need to
be

00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
and if so why so maybe you could speak
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
to that too
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
i think that's the main things right now
 
00:25:08.789 --> 00:25:08.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
charlie yep sorry i shouldn't speak too
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
well with technology when i do that
 
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.430 align:start position:0%
well with technology when i do that
right

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
um i'll answer i'll answer in reverse
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
order if i can the represent of ames
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
i see the bet limit um 10 or 25
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
to me the difference in terms of handle
 
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
would be a material
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't see a large difference in the
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
amount of wagering activity
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
not a lot of folks will have a bet a
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
single bet above ten dollars
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
on a machine like this generally what
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
you have is you have folks who
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
go with a budget a set amount of money
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and look to play for a long time and so
 
00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
um it's it's unlikely you would have a
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
large amount of play at 25
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
or even above 10 so that's why the
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal doesn't change
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
um and the number of machines
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
honestly i don't know the answer to that
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
based on the number of facilities
 
00:26:08.549 --> 00:26:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
it would determine how many machines
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
there are what type
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
and how they're configured um
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
handled up to your point um well i say
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the amount of
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh money is not 547 there's no question
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
that in our fiscal note
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
and the amount of money that actually
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
goes through these facilities is 65
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars so i don't discount the
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money in question
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's a large sum of money it's just not
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
the big number which can sometimes get
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
inflated uh or it can be
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
scary because it's such a large number
 
00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.950 align:start position:0%
scary because it's such a large number
um

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
and we certainly over the last several
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
years as we incorporated
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
racing and charitable gambling we
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
increased our financial audit capacity
 
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
increased our financial audit capacity
significantly

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
um for the first time in our history of
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
the last two years we've audited every
 
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.310 align:start position:0%
the last two years we've audited every
room

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
in our under our umbrella
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
we regularly audit charities to make
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
sure they the the revenues are correct
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i think i've said before when we
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
first absorbed this agency
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
we sent out 500 subpoenas to everybody
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
involved in the process to make sure
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's numbers were correct
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
and by and large we found that the
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
numbers were correct which was a
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
assumption that i didn't make originally
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
but certainly came to
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
after taking over this agency
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we will beef up our regulatory
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
staff as well there's a companion bill
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
filed by representative abrami related
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
compliance and investigation division
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
which you folks
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
voted ought to pass um do they get
 
00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
transferred edna
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
but certainly looking to beef up our
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
investigatory functions
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
and powers of the division um and we do
 
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.070 align:start position:0%
and powers of the division um and we do
have

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
open positions currently that are funded
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
not filled that we will also add to
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
um that division i know john once
 
00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
and john grifford wants that any
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
question eddie said
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
so just to representative ames point um
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
with an increase
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
in uh money coming into these facilities
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
we would also
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
increase our oversight of anti-money
 
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.630 align:start position:0%
increase our oversight of anti-money
laundering

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
laundering
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
um so a lot of these rooms would be
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
subject to federal requirements
 
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.350 align:start position:0%
subject to federal requirements
regarding

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh suspicious activity reporting um
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
and uh and reporting any
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
large tier transactions um and we
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
we are monitoring that in some of the
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
rooms where we've had sports betting
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
we've uh
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
we have had the rooms implement uh
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
federally compliant anti-money
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
laundering policies so on the front end
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
in the room itself we're making sure
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
that the cash
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
handling and cash reporting activities
 
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh are being done to
 
00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.039 align:start position:0%
federal legal standards um and then as
 
00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
federal legal standards um and then as
uh

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
as charlie said uh on the back end
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
we have a robust audit program that
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
we've built out over the last couple
 
00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:59.669 align:start position:0%
we've built out over the last couple
years

00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to go into every facility
 
00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:03.039 align:start position:0%
every few months
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um to take to take a look at their books
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh to take a look at their financial
 
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh to take a look at their financial
reporting

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
and to do a pretty um focused audit
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh that the financial
 
00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
to make sure that uh that the financial
reporting

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh both to the state and then also
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
making sure that the charities are
 
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:20.950 align:start position:0%
making sure that the charities are
getting

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh their fare cut based on the statutory
 
00:29:24.399 --> 00:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh their fare cut based on the statutory
percentage

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and obviously we would extend that out
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
to the historic horse racing
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
activities as well as charlie said as we
 
00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
get more activity we're going to need
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
more bodies but we have
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
the the programs and procedures in place
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
right now based on our games of chance
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up representative ames
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate those answers that's
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
good information and thank you
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
you're doing good work there um
 
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
so uh two two questions one is uh on the
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
bet limit
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
you said it really wouldn't make that
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
much difference and uh
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
my my question is why why raise the debt
 
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.190 align:start position:0%
my my question is why why raise the debt
limit

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
limit
 
00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to 25 if
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
most bettors will get below ten dollars
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then uh the other question
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh is machines and uh
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
you're using a thousand machines just as
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
a way of doing this
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
analysis i understand that but i would
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
expect that there would be
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
a pretty significant difference in the
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
across the 16 locations
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
and i've got i think a thousand by 16
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
divided by 16 is about 60 but that's
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
just an
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
average so what's your
 
00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
best guesstimate of how this is going to
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
the spread of the machines across the
 
00:30:52.399 --> 00:30:55.350 align:start position:0%
the spread of the machines across the
state

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
certainly um if i recall correctly
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's no magic to the 25
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
i think it was meant to comport with the
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
largest ticket
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the lottery can sell so under the
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
rsa's related to the lottery the largest
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
ticket size is 25 and it comports with
 
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.789 align:start position:0%
ticket size is 25 and it comports with
that

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the answer to that
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
question representative ames there was
 
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.190 align:start position:0%
question representative ames there was
no

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
magic to it so that wasn't our idea it
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
was just i think somebody asked what's
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
the biggest bet the lottery can place
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it's 25 um as for the map of
 
00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.509 align:start position:0%
and it's 25 um as for the map of
machines

00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
i would certainly um if i was building
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
it out
 
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
and if the marketplace was speaking
 
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.389 align:start position:0%
and if the marketplace was speaking
correctly

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
i would assume the vast majority of
 
00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
machines would be in rocky and
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
hillsborough county
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
locations down that way and as close to
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
population centers as could possibly be
 
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.149 align:start position:0%
population centers as could possibly be
imagined

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
imagined
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh and so the plurality of the machines
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
to the majority would likely be near or
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the last border
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the facilities there um only because
 
00:31:59.509 --> 00:31:59.519 align:start position:0%
the marketplace can handle them there
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
versus locations where there's not much
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
population so the distribution would not
 
00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.190 align:start position:0%
population so the distribution would not
be

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
16 dividing dividing but dividing a
 
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
16 dividing dividing but dividing a
thousand

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
it would be something different than
 
00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:13.110 align:start position:0%
it would be something different than
that

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay um representative
 
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.909 align:start position:0%
okay um representative
gord

00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
thank you um i have a question
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
probably for representative almi i'm
 
00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:26.310 align:start position:0%
probably for representative almi i'm
curious

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
curious
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an a way to
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
change the percentages that go to
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
our nonprofits if this is truly
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
i just i'm a little concerned just from
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
someone who used to run a nonprofit that
 
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the numbers just seemed
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
really small um and i didn't know if
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
there was a way to
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
um change
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
what it just seems like a bad deal for
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
the state as well but is there a way to
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
kind of change
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
and that was a question to represent yes
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
please i think or
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative you want to respond
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
first and then
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
oh i'm the last person to ask that too
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
i think it would be uh to mr mcintyre
 
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
about on why we have to give so much
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
money to the operators for this
 
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
but i i wanted to follow up later as
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
soon as i can with with miss mcintyre
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
charlie did you want to respond to
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative forks
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly um because these machines are
 
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:42.710 align:start position:0%
certainly um because these machines are
not

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
what you would call video lottery
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
terminals or which is called the
 
00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:46.710 align:start position:0%
terminals or which is called the
vernacular

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
vernacular
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
slot machines they're not
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
as attractive as they would be if they
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
were so
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh the percentage that the operator gets
 
00:33:57.669 --> 00:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
is to sort of
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for all the cost of
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
operations the facility itself the labor
 
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.549 align:start position:0%
operations the facility itself the labor
costs

00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
our compliance requirements which will
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
be onerous
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
um the machines themselves also want to
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
on a rev share
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
so a machine manufacturer will take a
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
percentage of the amount that machine
 
00:34:15.839 --> 00:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
percentage of the amount that machine
gets

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
gets
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
to reimburse it into profit as a going
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
business um
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the reason it's these you
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
know 65 million dollars divided by six
 
00:34:27.669 --> 00:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
to 16 facilities
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
it's not obviously a one for one but
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
a large number it's not a large revenue
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
for a business
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
that has to maintain a significant
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
amount of uh requirements
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the way it sits
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
if these were vlts the number will be
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
much much higher
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
but they're not um and so that's where
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
00:34:55.349 --> 00:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
question i want to
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh follow up with what representative
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
gorg uh
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out about that percentage uh
 
00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
and uh i also
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh so that that's she's she brought that
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
up that's out on the table now
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
um and i would like to uh see that
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
percentage increased
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
it goes to the non-profits end of the
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
state the uh
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
but my my uh
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
other question if i may or my
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
comment is you know in uh
 
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
in an effort to uh put in full
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
transparency i
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
um agree with representative almi
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
that um we should think about a local
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
option here because i think if local
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
voters knew what that percentage was and
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
how much was not going to
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh the non-profits and the state
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
they may have a different opinion about
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want to expand this
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
because it looks very tiny and
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
is not a number that i would want to
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
have to defend
 
00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.589 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think you'll find mr chair
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
i think you'll find if you go if you dig
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
down into the numbers
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
that the number's actually fair number
 
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:18.710 align:start position:0%
that the number's actually fair number
and

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
remember we we passed a this this body
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
passed a
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
uh a commission or a joint committee
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
with the senate
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
we can address all of these issues uh
 
00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.950 align:start position:0%
we can address all of these issues uh
because

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is again broader than just
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh then uh excuse me then uh then
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to bring this type of
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
topic up i think you're going to bring
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
it up
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
for all of charitable gaming why aren't
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
the charities getting more in general
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
is it's a broader question than just
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
historic racing machines
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
and again that could be addressed but i
 
00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:57.030 align:start position:0%
and again that could be addressed but i
think

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
what you need to do is do an honest
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
honest assessment of
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable margin someone in
 
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.510 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable margin someone in
business

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
doing this and i've looked at it
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
different ways and it seems like this is
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
a reasonable margin
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
for the risk that they're taking uh
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to put this out there
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
and again remember we're talking about
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
adding 5.7 million dollars to the
 
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.150 align:start position:0%
adding 5.7 million dollars to the
charities

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
12 million dollars to the education
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
at 821 000 in the
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh problem gambling fund
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh through this through just this action
 
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:39.829 align:start position:0%
uh through this through just this action
of

00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
of historic racing so
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
um you know it looks on paper you look
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
at it you go wow
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but they got to turn the lights on
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
they got to turn the heat on
 
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
they gotta buy the machines they got to
 
00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
do all this other stuff
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh that's that is required in running a
 
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:01.670 align:start position:0%
uh that's that is required in running a
business

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
so i'll leave it at that and i'm not
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
believe me
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
if i thought if i personally thought
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
that that these facilities were making
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
too much
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be the prime sponsor of this
 
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.589 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be the prime sponsor of this
bill

00:38:17.589 --> 00:38:17.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you uh before we go to
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
actually representative said but before
 
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.829 align:start position:0%
actually representative said but before
that

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:27.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
the point i want to make
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
representative and representative
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
malloy's question
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
is that we had slews and slews of
 
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.790 align:start position:0%
is that we had slews and slews of
correspondence

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
correspondence
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
from various charities in support of
 
00:38:47.589 --> 00:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
but i don't remember one charity
 
00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:55.839 align:start position:0%
that was against this bill
 
00:38:59.430 --> 00:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
and the charities why are they out
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill if they think
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
they're getting
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
too little so that's the question
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative decided
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman just uh to this
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
point i i happen to have
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
the numbers in front of me as an example
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
out of a 100 dollar
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
wage made 92 dollars of that is paid
 
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.470 align:start position:0%
wage made 92 dollars of that is paid
back

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.040 align:start position:0%
to the player 2.50 is paid back
 
00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
paid out to the state and the charity
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
two dollars and fifty cents is paid to
 
00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
two dollars and fifty cents is paid to
the

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
machine manufacturer of the software
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
licensing etc
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh operating expenses of two dollars and
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
forty cents and
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go through that list
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
but the uh the end result is
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
60 cents or point six percent
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
of that hundred dollar bet goes to the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
operators and
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
two point five percent go to the both
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
the charity in the state so
 
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh it's in line with with other
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
representative naomi you have your hands
 
00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:10.790 align:start position:0%
representative naomi you have your hands
up

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
i do i'm not new at this point though i
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
am still trying to get back
 
00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay you have a question to represent
 
00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:23.349 align:start position:0%
okay you have a question to represent
for

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre let's just state your
 
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.589 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre let's just state your
question

00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you on you as far as i can tell
 
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
thank you on you as far as i can tell
are

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
only auditing for whether the money
 
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
that is uh earned extracted from
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
on the the users of the charitable
 
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.030 align:start position:0%
on the the users of the charitable
gaming

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
facility is correctly
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
on accounted for
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
and provided to the places it's supposed
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
to be provided to
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
what i am concerned with is
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
the people that become
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
problem gamblers because they are
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
in places that have one of these
 
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.710 align:start position:0%
in places that have one of these
facilities

00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
on it is a very long way to a slot
 
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.349 align:start position:0%
on it is a very long way to a slot
machine

00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
machine
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
which is in massachusetts on
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
the research that was done by a
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
person that ran charitable
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh that would um that was funded
 
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
by the major casinos that was in
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for about 10 years before
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
he moved to texas
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
on showed that the people
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that were near small casinos
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
in rhode island were spending small
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
amounts of money
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
in those casinos and going on weekends
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
because they'd gotten
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
gotten on very addicted to this
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh they they were going over to
 
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.430 align:start position:0%
uh they they were going over to
connecticut

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
connecticut
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
so that is a thing
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
now what i am most interested in
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
is how we can
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
identify and
 
00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
and try to
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
help the people that come to these
 
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.190 align:start position:0%
help the people that come to these
facilities

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
because they are lonely because
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
on they they are
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh addictive personalities in the first
 
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh addictive personalities in the first
place

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
on and on become
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
on keep coming back and staying in front
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
of that machine for hours
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
because you have to accept
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
that when you have autocad on a machine
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
almost everybody is going to push the
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
autocad button
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
and treat it as a slow version
 
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
and not very slow version of a slot
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
machine it is a lot faster version than
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
some things we saw in the past
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
and what i want to ask mr mcintyre
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
is as i understand it
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
these machines are controlled from
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
the software and machine distributor
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
they are not controlled elsewhere
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
how can you try to put in controls
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
that will sh that will identify people
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
that are spending hours
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
at at one of these machines
 
00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
so that your uh
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement arm and the chair the
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh problem gambling fund
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
on are capable of
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with for any gambling there is a
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
certain amount
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
of of addiction but for machines there
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
is much more so how
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
how can you find out who these people
 
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:01.589 align:start position:0%
how can you find out who these people
are

00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
and see if they are willing to ban
 
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.589 align:start position:0%
and see if they are willing to ban
themselves

00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
see uh see if they
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
charlie uh certainly um
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative alani uh to your point
 
00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:28.640 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can increase the amount of display
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
for responsible gaming
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
in each facility uh we can mandate
 
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.309 align:start position:0%
in each facility uh we can mandate
training

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
for the staff in questions of the 16
 
00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.670 align:start position:0%
for the staff in questions of the 16
facilities

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
um adding controls to a machine is kind
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
of tricky
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
only because we're not going to you're
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to know
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a new player an old player in a
 
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.470 align:start position:0%
if it's a new player an old player in a
machine

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
the machines themselves are obviously
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
tested so you know what you're getting
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
the math behind it
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
one of the provisions is certification
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
by a testing lab
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
so the machines themselves are operating
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
within the specifications we dictate
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of help all we can do is sort
 
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.109 align:start position:0%
in terms of help all we can do is sort
of

00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
offer multiple aspects of multiple
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
communication channels
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to folks who want help
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
one of the nice things about our
 
00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:26.319 align:start position:0%
obviously our other platforms is they
 
00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:26.710 align:start position:0%
obviously our other platforms is they
have

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
exclusion lists that are because of the
 
00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.390 align:start position:0%
exclusion lists that are because of the
technology

00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
i mean certainly we could um offer an
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
exclusion list
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
for each facility as well and we could
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
offer that statewide
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
it does bring up enforcement
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
difficulties as you can imagine because
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard you know absent very expensive
 
00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.390 align:start position:0%
it's hard you know absent very expensive
technology

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to manage that level of
 
00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.230 align:start position:0%
uh it's hard to manage that level of
exclusion

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
exclusion
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh and even those i will tell you uh
 
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:54.400 align:start position:0%
somebody who's dealt in this
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
world for a long time um it's when
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
people take personal responsibility that
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
it really takes hold
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
not the government itself dictating
 
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.750 align:start position:0%
not the government itself dictating
terms

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up can you
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
limit it to about two minutes yes
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes uh if i can on
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
first personal responsibility is
 
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
negated by addiction that is the problem
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
with addiction
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
on second on the major casinos
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
have ways of tracking all of this but it
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
as you said pretty impossible to track
 
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:36.550 align:start position:0%
as you said pretty impossible to track
it

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
in these small tiny mini
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.710 align:start position:0%
in these small tiny mini
places

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
possibly on the brook
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
could track it it's big enough to be a
 
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.710 align:start position:0%
could track it it's big enough to be a
casino

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
casino
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
but on this is is something that
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
if if nothing can be done about this
 
00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to overwhelm
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
charlie you want to respond
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that was the former
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
question mr chairman
 
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i think it was more informative of a
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
statement so
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
you have your hands up i did yes i had a
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up i'm so sorry
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
um first of all thank you a
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
representative giusette for going
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
through the breakdown it was really nice
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
that actually representative all me i
 
00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
mean not me i'm sorry abrami sent
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
us all that breakdown so i thank you for
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
repeating it though
 
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:40.640 align:start position:0%
and to the chair um although yes
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
everybody look we got a lot of responses
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
from charitable
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh organizations it doesn't hurt to ask
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
for more
 
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna throw that out there
 
00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.309 align:start position:0%
so i'm just gonna throw that out there
um

00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
because nonprofits are where my heart is
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
so if i can get more money for them i'm
 
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
gonna ask
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
but i do have a question for um my
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up to
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
um mr mcintyre is what
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
um the operator's share and the amount
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
that the state gets and the operating
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
costs and all of that stuff is that on
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
par with other states that do
 
00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
this historic racing representative um
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and certainly
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
i've been remiss in not
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
telling the committee that um based on
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
the prior
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
filing of the bill related to study of
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
child gambling
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
unh to research this and so we sent out
 
00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
a study to
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
all of our charities in question asking
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
them a series of questions related to
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
charitable gambling um that came from us
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
that didn't come from anybody and we're
 
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
paying for it ourselves
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that um how satisfied they are are
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
they getting what they want all these
 
00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:47.430 align:start position:0%
they getting what they want all these
things

00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so as soon as we get the results
 
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
that we'll share them with everybody
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
um because we're giant research nuts
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
here so if
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
there's an issue you want to know about
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
it before we end so i wanted to
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
share that because i completely forgot
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
about it um
 
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
second also uh yes the answer is
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh this rate of we'll call it a tax rate
 
00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
uh this rate of we'll call it a tax rate
25

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's really just a rev share is
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with other states
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh kentucky wyoming virginia the three
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
that i would point to
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
and they're approximately the same
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh commissioner
 
00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh commissioner
mcintyre

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
mcintyre
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
it appears that the um figures quoted by
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
representative doucet
 
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
coming from the the colorful sheet
 
00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
we got this one um
 
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:41.910 align:start position:0%
we got this one um
[Music]

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
says 92 percent goes back to the players
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
but the fiscal note
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
it looks like 88 goes back to the
 
00:49:49.359 --> 00:49:50.069 align:start position:0%
it looks like 88 goes back to the
players

00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
players
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
am i looking at this wrong
 
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
so for our purposes uh we work off of
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
the lowest common denominator and the
 
00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.190 align:start position:0%
the lowest common denominator and the
bill

00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
says that a minimum of 88 percent has to
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
go back in prizes
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
so for us we use the minimum which is 88
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
and the 12
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
the remainder um
 
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:14.720 align:start position:0%
prize payout is one of those things that
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
we live and breathe by
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so depending upon how the machines
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
are manufactured and placed
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the facilities the price payout will
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
vary i wouldn't imagine that much it
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
will vary probably between 89 and 91
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
and so our take will be off of that i
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
think it was just done for ease of math
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative to that point um
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
by the same token i want to leave this
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
point very clear is
 
00:50:43.829 --> 00:50:43.839 align:start position:0%
because there's less of a margin
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
does not mean there's less profit quite
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
the opposite
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
um lower margin in gambling generally
 
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
yields to higher profit
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
and i'll make that case for the lottery
 
00:50:54.559 --> 00:50:56.230 align:start position:0%
and i'll make that case for the lottery
side

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
side
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
our margin has gone down by i think five
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
percent over the last 10 years
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
and our profitability has gone up by
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
about 30 million
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
so um just because the margin is
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
different don't
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
look to a one-for-one overlap comparison
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
does that make sense to you yes it does
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
may i have a follow-up please
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
um so it depends on the way the machines
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
are uh manufactured as to what the odds
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
correct it's really more because it's a
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
paramutual product it's more of the sort
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
the races that win and the um
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
and how the machine is lays out the
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
specific odds and the specific payout
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
for specific races
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and it will
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
vary too representative garland it'll
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
vary by
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
which horses come through which what's
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
dates and what's times but it'll be
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative murphy thank you mr
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
this is to commissioner uh just a simple
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
question do you know
 
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh regionally or nationally how many
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
people with this
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
historic betting um use the auto cap
 
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.109 align:start position:0%
historic betting um use the auto cap
function

00:52:11.109 --> 00:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
apologize i don't i
 
00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
emily thank you
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
i wanted to address the charity
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
area uh first they are
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh this is free money for the charities
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
second a huge percentage of those came
 
00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
out of the city of nashua
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
on and third on
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
i explored this a little in my community
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
on there were several people that
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
on i approached who said that they
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
do not want to see this in our community
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
on i approached the rotary
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
club because they had actually signed up
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
with the poker club
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
and i was told we spent an enormous
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time arguing about whether
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get money from poker even
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
though a number of them
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
play poker uh most of them play poker
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh in friendly games on
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
and the idea on
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
a machine
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
operation is one that
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
is highly unacceptable
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
in our area on i don't say that that's
 
00:53:45.359 --> 00:53:45.829 align:start position:0%
in our area on i don't say that that's
true

00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
of nashua they're very close to the
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts border
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
massachusetts on bets
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
more money per capita than i think
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
um so on they
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
they're interested in these things but
 
00:54:03.839 --> 00:54:04.309 align:start position:0%
they're interested in these things but
on

00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
in my area no thank
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
is that a you of a question or just a
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
statement no it's a continuing
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
question about why we cannot have local
 
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
question about why we cannot have local
options

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i got it um
 
00:54:38.309 --> 00:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
so i i i guess i've got one question for
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre but uh then i've got a
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
couple of questions for
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative romney but i don't know
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
how you want to handle that
 
00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the question
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
to uh mr mcintyre
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
is uh relates to the selection of
 
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.230 align:start position:0%
is uh relates to the selection of
charities

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
charities
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
um to participate in
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
um dates with the
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
operators and um my
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
question is whether what your rules
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
provide with what what boundary lines or
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
systems you have put in place
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
through rule for the selection of uh
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the charities that are going to
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
benefit from this charitable
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
gambling or is this all delegated to
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh operators the lottery takes no part
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
in choosing charities uh
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's left the operator representative
 
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:39.829 align:start position:0%
that's left the operator representative
ames

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
ames
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
okay now you have a question for
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
you have a question for representative
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes i do yeah
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay um so my question to you
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative romney is uh
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
is why uh okay
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of questions here why
 
00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:02.150 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of questions here why
you

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
chose to put forward in this bill
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
a bet limit of twenty five dollars
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
rather than ten dollars
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then um why
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
you chose not to include in this bill
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
the limitation that was
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the bill as sent forward
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
with amendment by the ways and means
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
limiting the use of the auto cap feature
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
and and then finally
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
whether you think it's okay that
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
gamble on these machines where we
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
require an age of 21 for
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
remember all the questions but is there
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars versus ten dollars
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh the twenty five dollars i was told it
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
didn't matter really uh because most
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
people are only going to bet two or
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
three dollars
 
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.990 --> 00:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
i was also told that there's a certain
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
vendor that
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
that has a trifecta kind of a bet
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
uh that could be a larger bet
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
so i said fine we'll put 25 but i was
 
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.270 align:start position:0%
so i said fine we'll put 25 but i was
told

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
told
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
in other locales no one bets 25
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
mr mcintyre mentioned uh people
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
people don't want to make one bet and
 
00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:49.030 align:start position:0%
people don't want to make one bet and
then

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
lose all their money and walk away they
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
want to play for the enjoyment of
 
00:57:52.559 --> 00:57:53.670 align:start position:0%
want to play for the enjoyment of
playing

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
playing
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
so that's that one the second question
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
is is
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you i totally forgot
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
about the the amendment
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
that was there from uh last last year i
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
guess it was last year
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh but you gotta remember about that
 
00:58:12.799 --> 00:58:13.829 align:start position:0%
uh but you gotta remember about that
amendment

00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
was that even though we had an amendment
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
that said there'd be no auto cap
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
there was still gonna be an auto cap
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically a manual auto cap
 
00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
that people were going to we're going to
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
pick them or
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
they were going to choose an automatic
 
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
they were going to choose an automatic
amount

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
without the machine doing it for them so
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
to me because i even went along with
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
that way back when
 
00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
but i'd be honest with you i totally
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
forgot about that when i
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
when i refiled a bill so and that that
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
just came up recently
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh and i think your comments to me about
 
00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh and i think your comments to me about
that

00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:51.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
the last question was age 18.
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
well look i mean um
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
all charitable gaming is 18 right now
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh all of uh lottery for the most part
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
you buy a scratch ticket you could buy a
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
25 scratch ticket
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
and be 18. i mean uh
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
and uh and i can go to i can go to the
 
00:59:17.599 --> 00:59:19.109 align:start position:0%
and uh and i can go to i can go to the
brook

00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
brook
 
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
and i can place a better aqueduct
 
00:59:21.839 --> 00:59:23.270 align:start position:0%
and i can place a better aqueduct
simulcast

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
simulcast
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
and be 18 years old and do that so
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
uh not simulcast racing
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
so you know we can address
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
the larger issue of the age of gambling
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
in the state if you'd like
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to do it within this
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill this bill isn't working within the
 
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.150 align:start position:0%
bill this bill isn't working within the
parameters

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
parameters
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
of what already exists that we've
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
recognized in this state since the 1930s
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
that an 18 year old can place a bet on a
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
horse race
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
and that's the case today was the case
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
10 years ago was the case 20 years ago
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that thank you
 
01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.510 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that thank you
representative

01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
would you this is to representative
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
abrami again would you support
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
uh changing back to a 10 debt limit
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and putting in the amendment that
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
we all
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
voted for um two years ago regarding
 
01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.470 align:start position:0%
voted for um two years ago regarding
autocad

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
autocad
 
01:00:30.150 --> 01:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not because i want to be consistent
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the the senate
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to be hard enough to pass
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
this on the floor
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
as is uh and i i

representative baxter thank you mr
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
chair um there's still an issue
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
myself i've mentioned it and multiple
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
members have the concern of whether
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
this will create a new tax on
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
travel agent services and
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's why i proposed an amendment to
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
try to alleviate
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
that concern i know there's some concern
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
about the language of the amendment
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
but there's been no proposed solution
 
01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.390 align:start position:0%
but there's been no proposed solution
that

01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
our caucus or the committee has come to
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
to deal with that concern so i think
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
we need to um alleviate that concern
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
before passing the bill
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
that's why i asked
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
the dra the present
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that we could have that discussion
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
we can have that discussion either
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
through a motion for an amendment or
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
just plain go to that discussion
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
and uh that has been a concern so
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
um representative gemaldo if you would
 
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.510 align:start position:0%

um what i just said a few minutes ago
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
about the concern about
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh this being a new tax on travel agent
 
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:24.000 align:start position:0%

01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%

01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
um i think what's difficult about this
 
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.310 align:start position:0%
um i think what's difficult about this
question

01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
um is that as we've sort of considered
 
01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:50.070 align:start position:0%
um is that as we've sort of considered
this

01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
issue over several legislative sessions
 
01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:53.270 align:start position:0%
issue over several legislative sessions
um

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
we've not ever heard from travel agents
 
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
um so i had to do a bit of baseline
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
research to answer this question
 
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
and what i've sort of found through my
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
own research is that travel agents
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
typically are compensated with a
 
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:15.030 align:start position:0%
typically are compensated with a
commission

01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
paid from the hotel for example
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
directly to the travel agent and
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
the m r tax is paid as a percentage
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
of the total price paid by the consumer
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
so in these what i understand to be the
 
01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.470 align:start position:0%
so in these what i understand to be the
typical

01:23:34.470 --> 01:23:34.480 align:start position:0%
typical
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
travel agent transactions the commission
 
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to tax
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
because it's paid by the hotel to the
 
01:23:42.870 --> 01:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
travel agent
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
not by the consumer to the travel agent
 
01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:46.390 align:start position:0%
not by the consumer to the travel agent
um

01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
and specifically i would look to line 16
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill which makes very clear that
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
it's paid by the
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
occupant if hb 15
 
01:24:01.430 --> 01:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
is passed as is we can certainly when we
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
um undertake the rule making process for
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
really flush that out in rules um
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think as i discussed with
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative major yesterday are
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
concerned with the amendment is whether
 
01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.229 align:start position:0%
concerned with the amendment is whether
it's

01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
a bit of um a blanket exemption
 
01:24:25.189 --> 01:24:25.199 align:start position:0%
if someone uses the term quote unquote
 
01:24:26.310 --> 01:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
travel agent
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
without sort of substantively sussing
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
out what that term
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
means and do we then sort of let someone
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
say i'm a travel agent and therefore
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
i'm carte blanc not obligated to collect
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
um so i understand the concern
 
01:24:44.629 --> 01:24:44.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely with making sure
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
travel agents are not unintentionally
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
looped in
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
i do think we can handle that issue in
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
in rules well why not just
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
amend or change the language slightly of
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
my amendment
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
or someone else could propose an
 
01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
or someone else could propose an
amendment

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
essentially saying this that travel
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
agent services won't be taxed but you
 
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:10.950 align:start position:0%
agent services won't be taxed but you
can't

01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
add a component of your business that's
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
a travel state service agency
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
to exempt the entirety of your
 
01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:20.149 align:start position:0%
to exempt the entirety of your
businesses

01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
i feel like that's it's fairly simple
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
the issue is if we don't have the
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
amendment in there
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
they're still looking the original
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
concern which hasn't been dealt with yet
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
and i and i respect what you're saying
 
01:25:33.750 --> 01:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
that it could be worked out but i feel
 
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.070 align:start position:0%
that it could be worked out but i feel
like

01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's a better approach to work it out
 
01:25:36.719 --> 01:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
it's a better approach to work it out
before

01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
we ought to pass the bill then to leave
 
01:25:44.629 --> 01:25:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:48.629 --> 01:25:48.639 align:start position:0%
so certainly um that would be
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have a position on that
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a workable
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
solution as well to deal with it in the
 
01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.270 align:start position:0%
solution as well to deal with it in the
bill

01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
um i would still say that i do
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
think we need we would still need to in
 
01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.149 align:start position:0%
think we need we would still need to in
rules

01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
substantively define what the term
 
01:26:05.510 --> 01:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
travel agent
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
means um so that you can't just you know
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
call yourself a travel agent and
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
therefore you are one we need to sort of
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
define that term to distinguish a travel
 
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:18.470 align:start position:0%
define that term to distinguish a travel
agent

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
agent
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
from a platform for example um
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
but i could we could certainly um do
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
that in rules as well
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and i guess that's kind of
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm getting to is
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
the amen it's not necessarily the the
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
amendment that's issues just making sure
 
01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:34.870 align:start position:0%
amendment that's issues just making sure
and

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
rules that the amendment is clarified to
 
01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:38.390 align:start position:0%
rules that the amendment is clarified to
not

01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:26:41.110 --> 01:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
allow people to call themselves a travel
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
agent when they're not
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
but as long as that's worked out and
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
rules then would you say the amendment
 
01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
i guess he's asking do we need to do we
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
need the amendment
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
well what i'm asking you is as long as
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
rules makes it clear that you can't just
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
call yourself a travel agent when you're
 
01:27:08.639 --> 01:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
call yourself a travel agent when you're
not

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't the amendment work as
 
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.470 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't the amendment work as
intended

01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
to make sure that travel agents aren't
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
being taxed
 
01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
which isn't the intent of anyone that
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
created this bill
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
without creating a new loophole just
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that's clear in rules that you
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
can't just
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm comfortable um
 
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
in saying that the um the definition of
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
travel agent
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
would fall within our rulemaking
 
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.390 align:start position:0%
would fall within our rulemaking
authority

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:27:45.510 --> 01:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think the question i have based on the
 
01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
i think the question i have based on the
language

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is whether the
 
01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.790 align:start position:0%
of the amendment is whether the
amendment

01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
language is clear enough that an
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
operator who has for example
 
01:27:59.830 --> 01:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
one percent of their line of business
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
being a travel agent business
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
and the other 99 attributable to
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
something where they would be
 
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting and remitting
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
the tax
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
that the one percent doesn't affect the
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
and is it is it your belief that
 
01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
through the the rules process that we
 
01:28:24.149 --> 01:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it clear that the 99
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
is being taxed as is the case now and
 
01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:34.719 align:start position:0%
i fear that the amendment as written
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
could be interpreted to scoop in the 99
 
01:28:43.910 --> 01:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
because it says the term shall not apply
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the services of a person formed firm
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
corporation or
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
partnership providing travel agent
 
01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.350 align:start position:0%
partnership providing travel agent
services

01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
but doesn't limit that phrase
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
to the portion of their business that
 
01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
to the portion of their business that
constitutes

01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
constitutes
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
being a travel agent i i
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
i hear what i hear what you're saying
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
about that fear and i guess what i'm
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
really trying to hammer down
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
is do not think that fear can be
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
eliminated through the rules process i
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
want to get a clear answer on your
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
perspective on that
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
i'm worried that um that the rule making
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
committee that reviews our rules
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
will say that we're acting outside of
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
our rule-making authority or
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
in contradiction to what the statute
 
01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
in contradiction to what the statute
says

01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay so i guess you're and you can
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm not understanding you
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
correctly but you're not sure what would
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
happen how
 
01:29:42.149 --> 01:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
how the rules process would work out
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
based off how the amendment is currently
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
written is that correct
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you i
 
01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd like to make a motion at
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't discuss this in
 
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.229 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't discuss this in
caucus

01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot of um uncertainty
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
at this point i think we should we
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
should work on the amendment language
 
01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
should work on the amendment language
before

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
ought to passing this bill this bill
 
01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
ought to passing this bill this bill
further

01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
and if anything i would make a motion
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying i'm making a motion right
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
now but if anything it should be
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
retained before we pass this
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
with all the uncertainty about my
 
01:30:20.709 --> 01:30:20.719 align:start position:0%
amendment language and with the travel
 
01:30:23.189 --> 01:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
agent component and i'm not the only
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
member on the committee that feels this
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
i think we can continue discussing this
 
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.030 align:start position:0%
i think we can continue discussing this
bill

01:30:33.030 --> 01:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
from what i hear the uh
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
first representative from the dra saying
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed as is not the
 
01:30:43.679 --> 01:30:44.709 align:start position:0%
the bill is passed as is not the
amendment

01:30:44.709 --> 01:30:44.719 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:30:46.629 --> 01:30:46.639 align:start position:0%
they could take care of this issue
 
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then so
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's up to the committee whether they
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
want to proceed
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
with i guess mr or go ahead mr chair i
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to cut you off if you want to
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
i i guess the where
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
what the concern is for me is we're
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
hearing well we can deal with the issue
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
without amending it
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
in rules but we think in rules that if
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
we do amend it we can't
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
we can't change the amendment so it's
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
kind of like which one is it you know
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
i would rather if the rules issues may
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
be a process i'd rather just
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
wait and make sure we do it right the
 
01:31:30.310 --> 01:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
first time
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
as a committee before sending it sending
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
it over to rules
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
without it being a hundred percent
 
01:31:36.239 --> 01:31:37.030 align:start position:0%
without it being a hundred percent
certain

01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
certain
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
we're gonna get the outcome we're
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
and there's we need to
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
answer a question do we get this over to
 
01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
they can deal with that issue if
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
we find that we come up with a solution
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
at this point the solution is is the
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
whether we have confidence in the dra
 
01:32:12.310 --> 01:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and what they told us that they can
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
handle that
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
and uh i think the committee needs to
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
make up their mind on that
 
01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
so why don't we hear from some of the
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i was out i would
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
like to ask tra
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
to elaborate a little bit on the
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
court decision and the restrictions that
 
01:32:38.639 --> 01:32:39.510 align:start position:0%
court decision and the restrictions that
placed

01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
placed
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
upon their uh tax collecting ability
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh that was referenced in their letter
 
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
could could they do that
 
01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:52.950 align:start position:0%
could could they do that
sir

01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.470 --> 01:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative i'm happy
 
01:33:00.070 --> 01:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
to discuss that briefly um
 
01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
so as you all
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
know because you've followed the case
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
throughout the last
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
several years
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
as these online room sharing
 
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:14.149 align:start position:0%
as these online room sharing
specifically

01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
platforms became
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
more prominent in the room rental and
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
hotel rental
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
market new hampshire along with every
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
other state
 
01:33:29.350 --> 01:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.750 --> 01:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
attempted to assert that the m r tax
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
requires the platform
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
to collect and remit the m r tax
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the various properties that
 
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
that case in new hampshire went all the
 
01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
that case in new hampshire went all the
way

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire supreme court
 
01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they said that excuse me
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
our statute which was you know drafted
 
01:34:00.550 --> 01:34:00.560 align:start position:0%
at a time when
 
01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
these weren't um or this wasn't a
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
prominent method
 
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
prominent method of renting rooms didn't
 
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.390 align:start position:0%
prominent method of renting rooms didn't
capture

01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
capture
 
01:34:11.910 --> 01:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
those um platforms as operators
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
and i think it's important to understand
 
01:34:18.149 --> 01:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
why the state would want to take the
 
01:34:18.159 --> 01:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
why the state would want to take the
position

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
that the platform and not the individual
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
is the operator um so
 
01:34:29.350 --> 01:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
under the m r tax statute you know every
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
person who owns a vacation home
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
or rents out an in-law suite on a
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
temporary basis
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
is required to become licensed and
 
01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.470 align:start position:0%
is required to become licensed and
submit

01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
submit
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
monthly returns to the state of new
 
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:43.750 align:start position:0%
monthly returns to the state of new
hampshire

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
and collect the m r tax on those
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
transactions that's the case even if
 
01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
transactions that's the case even if
someone

01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
someone
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
only rents their room for one night out
 
01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're required to become licensed and
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
collect and remit the m
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
r tax so as a
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
sort of administrative convenience for
 
01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
sort of administrative convenience for
us

01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
as well as the individual operators
 
01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:10.639 align:start position:0%
we do think that it's certainly a more
 
01:35:10.639 --> 01:35:11.830 align:start position:0%
we do think that it's certainly a more
efficient

01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
efficient
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
method of tax collection for us to
 
01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.590 align:start position:0%
method of tax collection for us to
license

01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
license
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
and expect the platforms to collect
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
rather than each individual home
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
owner it results in you know thousands
 
01:35:28.709 --> 01:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
of less m r tax returns
 
01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
each month um were we to
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
audit we would audit the platform
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
rather than each individual property
 
01:35:38.950 --> 01:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
owner and
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
because the platform is actually
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
the entity that assesses the tax
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
and collects the money from the consumer
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
think it's the platform who's properly
 
01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
think it's the platform who's properly
responsible

01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
for that collection and remission and
 
01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:56.709 align:start position:0%
for that collection and remission and
audit

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
audit
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.669 --> 01:36:01.679 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:36:01.679 --> 01:36:04.790 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
representative

01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the question that was raised by
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative baxter
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to make sure that this was
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
not a new tax
 
01:36:19.669 --> 01:36:19.679 align:start position:0%
and that the clarification as to who was
 
01:36:21.990 --> 01:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
going to pay the tax
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
does that court ruling apply to the
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
questions that the representative baxter
 
01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.229 align:start position:0%
questions that the representative baxter
raised

01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
um not directly um
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
i could look back and
 
01:36:39.350 --> 01:36:39.360 align:start position:0%
get you any comments that the court made
 
01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
on the issue
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
of um fees generally
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
but the court never really had to get to
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
that question
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
um because they ended their their
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
analysis really at the
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
at the level of the operator is not
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
um the platform is not an operator um
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
and that sort of ends the inquiry um
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
but i could look back and see if there's
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
any what i would call dicta
 
01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
about the um the fee portion
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
um but i think in this instance i think
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
the statute is very
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
clear that the the tax applies to the
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money paid by the consumer
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
to rent the room so as
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
to the the travel agent question
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
so long as we're talking about sort of
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
the typical transaction as i understand
 
01:37:33.119 --> 01:37:33.669 align:start position:0%
the typical transaction as i understand
it

01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:33.679 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
the travel agent's fee which generally
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
is not
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
paid by the consumer is never going to
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
be captured by the m r tax
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
which is why i'm sort of comfortable
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
saying we can deal with that issue
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
in rule um i think it becomes
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
murkier simply because of the
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you uh miss claire the uh
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
from what you just said it seems as
 
01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.390 align:start position:0%
from what you just said it seems as
though

01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
dra is very clear that this doesn't
 
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
apply to the agent
 
01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
in any case because of the
 
01:38:21.109 --> 01:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
wording in the existing law
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the restrictions that were placed on
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
the agency's tax collection ability
 
01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
by the decision in a broad sense not in
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
a narrow sense but in a broad sense
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
applying it to the individual paying the
 
01:38:37.119 --> 01:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
applying it to the individual paying the
tax

01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
have i got that more or less correct
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative you i believe you
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
have that correctly
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you mr chair thank
 
01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:50.550 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am thank you mr chair thank
you

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
for the question that was very
 
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.830 align:start position:0%
for the question that was very
enlightening

01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
enlightening
 
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that there
 
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that there
is

01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
a difficulty in that
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
many members actually not just new
 
01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
many members actually not just new
members

01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't understand the on
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
jail car process and the fact that if
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
their attorneys feel that on
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
something is that is put forward by the
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
agency does not
 
01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
represent the intent of the legislators
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
on they on impose
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
fairly heavy sanctions that we put in
 
01:39:33.590 --> 01:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
place because agencies were
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
getting out of control about 20 years
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
ago so
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
on i think that we really should solve
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
this ourselves rather than go back uh
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
let it go to the senate and have the
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
same argument
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
i that and i think that it ought to be
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
fairly easy to put an amendment in
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that was fashioned between
 
01:40:00.770 --> 01:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
the dra and
 
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.149 align:start position:0%
the dra and
[Music]

01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative baxter on that says
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
that this does not apply to on
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
services provided on
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
as a travel agent which on
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
are not on the rentals
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
of rooms
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
on or cars and
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then leave it to the dra
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
in rules to specify okay this is a
 
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
in rules to specify okay this is a
travel

01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
agent service
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
on something of that nature and that we
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
ought that ought to be able to be
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
produced by tomorrow
 
01:40:49.350 --> 01:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
in my opinion thank you okay
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i've been in the
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry for 30 years
 
01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
and um i have an example that might be
 
01:41:03.270 --> 01:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
helpful so back in the day when starwood
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
was a hotel brand before it became a
 
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.830 align:start position:0%
was a hotel brand before it became a
marriott

01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
marriott
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
they we used to have a program where
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
anyone could get
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
money back on a particular event it was
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
built into the contract
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
and at one point it actually was changed
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
so only real estate agent i've never
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
really seen apologize travel agents
 
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
could get
 
01:41:28.550 --> 01:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
that particular it's not a kickback but
 
01:41:30.149 --> 01:41:30.159 align:start position:0%
it is an extra
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
bonus to them to book at a particular
 
01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:33.910 align:start position:0%
bonus to them to book at a particular
hotel

01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and the way that we did it was that
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
the travel agent had to provide their
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
um travel there's a travel agent network
 
01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:43.990 align:start position:0%
um travel there's a travel agent network
um

01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's an international airline travel
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
network it's
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
iatan and they also have an american
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
society for travel agents
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
a s t a um
 
01:41:58.629 --> 01:41:58.639 align:start position:0%
we require them to put their membership
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
number in there and that kind
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
of bypassed it made them legitimate
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
travel agents right for so those who had
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
that as a business
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
um are part of these membership
 
01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.709 align:start position:0%
um are part of these membership
organizations

01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that's helpful to
 
01:42:14.229 --> 01:42:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative baxter or if it'd be
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
helpful to
 
01:42:18.550 --> 01:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
dra but that might be a way to help
 
01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
um clarify in rules or in any amendment
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to add there this is
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
common in the hospitality industry
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of how they get around
 
01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.830 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of how they get around
this

01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative of romney
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
all i can say is wow um
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to vote on this the way it is
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
but i'll respect
 
01:42:49.590 --> 01:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
others that still have or that are
 
01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.430 align:start position:0%
others that still have or that are
uncomfortable

01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh and feel that we need an amendment
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
as long as someone's willing to put the
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
energy in to get the amendment going
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think we can handle the whole issue
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
and rules i
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see a big deal here
 
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
but if someone wants to take another
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
crack at an amendment
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's go do it uh
 
01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
and as representative romney said we
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
could probably take this up tomorrow but
 
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know representative baxter you
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
did take
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
you took a crack at an amendment it
 
01:43:24.149 --> 01:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like that amendment still needs
 
01:43:24.159 --> 01:43:25.510 align:start position:0%
sounds like that amendment still needs
work

01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you're willing to take another
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
crack at that amendment
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
um that's fine with me
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh but there's gonna be a point at which
 
01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:37.570 align:start position:0%
we're gonna run out of time here
 
01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:38.870 align:start position:0%
we're gonna run out of time here
[Music]

01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
understanding this was the house
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
position last term
 
01:43:44.310 --> 01:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh meaning the ways and means position i
 
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
should say that was the ways of means
 
01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
should say that was the ways of means
position

01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
of the members that were present then
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on this i think
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative malloy had the
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on it
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
i was a member of it and we spent a lot
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
of time with the era on it
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
and we pretty much went around around
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
and we we
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
put together what we thought was pretty
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
good legislation so again i don't want
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
to be the one saying
 
01:44:10.629 --> 01:44:10.639 align:start position:0%
you know whatever if it sounds like
 
01:44:12.310 --> 01:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's still some folks who want to see
 
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:12.629 align:start position:0%
there's still some folks who want to see
an

01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
amendment i'm okay with that i'm not
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be the one to do it
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
but uh but if we're going to do it we
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
got to do it
 
01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh soon thank you
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative southwood uh thank
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
um i agree mostly with representative
 
01:44:31.679 --> 01:44:32.550 align:start position:0%
um i agree mostly with representative
abrami

01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
abrami
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
um i have the confidence in
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
dra's rule-making procedures
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
to me this bill is about fairness and
 
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.109 align:start position:0%
to me this bill is about fairness and
again

01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
i was around before when a lot of work
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
went into the bill
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
my only variance from um representative
 
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
abrami is i really don't think an
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
amendment is necessary
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i would hope um
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't have to spend extra time on
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment if it really
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
isn't really necessary so i'd be ready
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
for otp today
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
spillsberg thank you mr chairman yeah
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just go on record now is
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
saying i think the bill
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
addresses the matter adequately
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh with all respect i do think that the
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
amendment monies the water
 
01:45:22.629 --> 01:45:22.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think an amendment is necessary
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
i think the rule making that
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh process will deal with any
 
01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.310 align:start position:0%
uh process will deal with any
clarifications

01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
clarifications
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
and basically the bill i think everyone
 
01:45:30.239 --> 01:45:31.830 align:start position:0%
and basically the bill i think everyone
agrees

01:45:31.830 --> 01:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
agrees
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
addresses the consequences of the
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
litigation dealing with online platforms
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
in the context of rental facilitators
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
of whether travel agent
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
services somehow represents a new tax
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think again can be dealt with
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
administratively it's clear to me that
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
the bill does not
 
01:45:57.189 --> 01:45:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
and very simply it's taxing everything
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
that the consumer
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
is required to pay for the purposes of
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
a room or a car
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
i think the skinny lift ticket package
 
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
things already been
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
dealt with um so it really comes down to
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
travel agent commissions and the fact is
 
01:46:21.669 --> 01:46:21.679 align:start position:0%
that those are done differently by
 
01:46:21.679 --> 01:46:22.149 align:start position:0%
that those are done differently by
different

01:46:22.149 --> 01:46:22.159 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
organizations airbnb they do it one way
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
booking.com they do it another way
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
it still comes down what does the
 
01:46:30.790 --> 01:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
consumer have to pay
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
to book the room or the parent and
 
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make a difference whether the
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
consumer pays the entire fee
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the booking agent who keeps his
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
commission and turns the rest
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
over to the hotel
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
for second whether he pays
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to the booking agent which is
 
01:46:55.910 --> 01:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
true at booking.com
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
and then pays on arrival and then
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
the hotel pays a commission separately
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is just a marketing expense or
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
third whether he pays the commission
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
to the booker and separately all three
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
of these i have seen an experience
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
the outcome's the same in every case the
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
total that the consumer pays
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
is subject to the from the meals tax and
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
i think the only thing that that boils
 
01:47:24.149 --> 01:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
down to that
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative baxter is actually asking
 
01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
is also clear and that is
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
if the consumer has paid the entire
 
01:47:34.159 --> 01:47:35.669 align:start position:0%
if the consumer has paid the entire
amount

01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
amount
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
and the amount includes whatever the
 
01:47:41.679 --> 01:47:42.310 align:start position:0%
and the amount includes whatever the
lodging

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
lodging
 
01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
facilities expenses are then there is no
 
01:47:45.679 --> 01:47:46.229 align:start position:0%
facilities expenses are then there is no
question

01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
when the lodging facility sends a
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
payment to the booking agent
 
01:47:54.390 --> 01:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
for their services that
 
01:47:57.109 --> 01:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
is already been in the amount that the
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
consumer paid
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's already been subject to the meals
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and we are not
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
proposing in this bill to double tax
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
the transaction that simply transmits
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i i'm sorry to go on that i just i
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
sat here
 
01:48:16.149 --> 01:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
listening to the entire discussion in
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
recent sessions and i think
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's there's not a problem here that we
 
01:48:24.070 --> 01:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
need to deal with
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm ready to vote representative elliot
 
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um this
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
bill on the 27th of january
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
was contested for over an
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
hour and at that point
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
madame carolyn lear stated that
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
litigation in every state
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
has been passed on this type of bill so
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
it's obviously
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
controversial i would hope that
 
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative baxter might want to
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
complete a clarification
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and present it to the
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee tomorrow when we
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
meet if that's okay with him but
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
right now i i think that this bill even
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
though if we passed it which i'm going
 
01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:18.550 align:start position:0%
though if we passed it which i'm going
to

01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
vote yes um is going to fail again
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chair
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i had some initial concerns with
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
this but after listening to uh
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
the uh dra i think i'm comfortable with
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:43.350 --> 01:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative nunes
 
01:49:46.229 --> 01:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm tending to
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
lead to the side where i think that we
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
might need to work on this methodology a
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
in statute before it gets handed over to
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
dra to make a rule
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
i didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling uh
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the commissioner
 
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
no no no disrespect there but i didn't
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
get the warm and fuzzy feeling that
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the rules committee for the dra
 
01:50:08.790 --> 01:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
was going to be in favor of a rule that
 
01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:10.639 align:start position:0%
would be adopted by her to take care of
 
01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:10.950 align:start position:0%
would be adopted by her to take care of
the

01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
to take care of the situation that we're
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
talking about in methodology
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
on top of these travel agents uh if
 
01:50:19.350 --> 01:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
representative baxter could be given an
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify that amendment
 
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think it would actually help the dra
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
make a better rule
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where i stand on that okay
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
let me ask
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative baxter
 
01:50:36.229 --> 01:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
if you think you could work with the dre
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
come up with an amendment for tomorrow
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely i'm happy to do that and
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%

01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
for three four years and i don't think
 
01:51:05.119 --> 01:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
for three four years and i don't think
it

01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
failed on the floor we just kept
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
studying it
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we were waiting for wayfair to
 
01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.629 align:start position:0%
and we were waiting for wayfair to
finish

01:51:12.629 --> 01:51:12.639 align:start position:0%
finish
 
01:51:15.430 --> 01:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh in order to pass it because it would
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
have been a little hypocritical
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
before on but on
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is something that on
 
01:51:27.589 --> 01:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
that depends a lot on the details of the
 
01:51:27.599 --> 01:51:29.030 align:start position:0%
that depends a lot on the details of the
language

01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
so i hope that our representative baxter
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
and ms lear will communicate
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
on with each other about the
 
01:51:41.030 --> 01:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties of the language versus what
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative baxter wants to do i'm
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to ask
 
01:51:48.310 --> 01:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative abrami
 
01:51:50.709 --> 01:51:50.719 align:start position:0%
and represent elmi to withdraw the
 
01:51:50.719 --> 01:51:56.709 align:start position:0%
and represent elmi to withdraw the
motion

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll deal with this tomorrow
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'll withdraw my second i would point
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
out we could do this on the
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
is here
 
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
is here
[Music]

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman there's a lot of internet
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
issues today people keep popping in and
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
out i'm watching in gallery view and
 
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:36.890 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:36.890 --> 01:53:31.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.830 --> 01:53:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay that was uh representative romney
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
his power just went out his generator
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
come on
 
01:53:42.149 --> 01:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
and so he's probably taking a little
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
while to come back on
 
01:53:45.830 --> 01:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
but i asked him if he would draw his
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
motion and he's
 
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to have
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative baxter
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
work with cowling to come up with a new
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
amendment for tomorrow and he agrees
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case anything else we
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
want to talk about
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
if not uh i recommend that we take
 
01:54:14.790 --> 01:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
a five to eight minute break
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
don't turn the video or your audio off
 
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:18.229 align:start position:0%
don't turn the video or your audio off
uh

01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:22.229 --> 01:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
just mute them and then we'll be back in
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.840 --> 02:00:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.840 --> 02:01:07.669 align:start position:0%
 
five

02:01:07.669 --> 02:01:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:07.679 --> 02:02:08.229 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative model yes
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
as pat rejoined us
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
i have not seen him yet
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
there's a telephone number oh maybe
 
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
that's him
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
i would say it is brad must have left
 
02:02:33.199 --> 02:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
i would say it is brad must have left
him

02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
that that is his number mr chair oh
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:50.390 --> 02:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
can can he hear us and speak because he
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.350 --> 02:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh star six for unmute but it looks like
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
you're unmuted anyways
 
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
oh now you're muted yeah that is
 
02:03:17.589 --> 02:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't sound like he can
 
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
yep

02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:44.870 --> 02:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes representative
 
02:03:47.589 --> 02:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask about the minority report
 
02:03:47.599 --> 02:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
you didn't ask about the minority report
for

02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
hp 626 but i think representative ames
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
was willing to do it
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be fine and when he
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
when representative ames has it
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
completed if he sends it
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to keep track of the
 
02:04:17.030 --> 02:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me it's not not a big hurry
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's no sessions scheduled i think i
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
i we heard that uh there might be a
 
02:04:26.470 --> 02:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
couple of days
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
at the end of this month yeah at the
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
end of this month but there's uncertain
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
i would say if you get it uh
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
now i'd like to know how you're active
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
there's no car right now if you're
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
and uh representative abrami we still
 
02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:22.229 align:start position:0%
and uh representative abrami we still
haven't

02:05:22.229 --> 02:05:22.239 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
heard you yet so i'm i'm nervous that
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
02:05:33.189 --> 02:05:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
represent romney if you could hear us
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
isn't star nine to put your hand up i
 
02:05:58.470 --> 02:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
think star six
 
02:06:02.149 --> 02:06:02.159 align:start position:0%
is to speak patricia
 
02:06:02.159 --> 02:06:05.510 align:start position:0%
is to speak patricia
six

02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
and it looks like we added
 
02:06:08.629 --> 02:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative lachmann um
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
alan for your attendance uh thank you
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%

i'm on it i know that he was here thank
 
02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:16.950 align:start position:0%
i'm on it i know that he was here thank
you

02:06:16.950 --> 02:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so representative abram it looks
 
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:20.800 align:start position:0%
like you muted yourself when you did
 
02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:22.390 align:start position:0%
like you muted yourself when you did
that

02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:25.589 --> 02:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
i think star 9 was your hand as well or
 
02:06:30.390 --> 02:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
do i have to do it
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
huh that's not good
 
02:06:34.950 --> 02:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know i didn't have internet this
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
morning and i came on initially
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
with my phone but it was via the zoom
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
app i itself
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
know if you can quickly download that
 
02:06:46.159 --> 02:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
know if you can quickly download that
and

02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
and i even had video use my camera
 
02:06:50.239 --> 02:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
and i even had video use my camera
somehow

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
somehow
so

02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.589 --> 02:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:03.990 --> 02:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah brad could you give representative
 
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:04.790 align:start position:0%

romney

02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:08.229 align:start position:0%
a hand on that yep if he um he may need

02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
back in again
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it just doesn't connect right
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
away so who may just need to
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.079 --> 02:07:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:07:36.310 --> 02:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
because nothing turns out to be easy
 
02:07:59.149 --> 02:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
i'd like to continue with house bill
 
02:07:59.159 --> 02:08:02.870 align:start position:0%

02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
increasing the exemption under the

consideration to

the implications of the rnd and tying
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
them versus going
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
separately and i think it requires
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
further attention
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%

02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
raises questions as to its scope we have
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
tax we have attacks right now
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
business proper business profits tax
 
02:27:07.910 --> 02:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
that applies to sole proprietors
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
we also have a business enterprise tax
 
02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
we also have a business enterprise tax
that

02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%

salaries as a core part of the formula
 
02:27:24.150 --> 02:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
and so there's ambiguities as well so i
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
i think this
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
proposal is not ready and should not be
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%

02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
mr chair it might be
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
helpful to make
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
clear what the rule will be on the floor
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's a majority coming out of the
 
02:30:06.319 --> 02:30:07.030 align:start position:0%
it's a majority coming out of the
committee

02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
um but maybe you could inform the
 
02:30:14.070 --> 02:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
committee of what happens on the floor
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
on the floor it takes i believe 60
 
02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.469 align:start position:0%
on the floor it takes i believe 60
percent

02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:30:21.510 --> 02:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
to pass on the floor 60 percent
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
of the i
 
02:30:27.910 --> 02:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
think it's the full house
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
that was present just those president
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh don't quote me on that yeah i was
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
gonna look it up i
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
didn't get around to it so i'm not
 
02:30:39.030 --> 02:30:39.040 align:start position:0%
actually sure sixty percent
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
anyway but it could be the present or
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
the house and
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
the way we're split i don't think it's
 
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
going to pass
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're just going to do a pi we're only
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
going to do a pi on our side
 
02:30:55.670 --> 02:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah there's not going to be a speech on
 
02:30:58.389 --> 02:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
our side i'll do a pi on
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
the other side okay well you know i
 
02:31:02.309 --> 02:31:02.319 align:start position:0%
can't speak for
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
the general population who knows who
 
02:31:05.510 --> 02:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
might speak up but uh
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
that would be the plan yeah as we get it
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
done quick
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%

02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
any broad-based sales tax should be
 
02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:45.990 align:start position:0%
any broad-based sales tax should be
prohibited

the motion
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
to pass this this you're not
 
02:32:52.870 --> 02:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
prohibiting attacks all you're doing is
 
02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
giving the people a chance
 
02:32:58.870 --> 02:32:58.880 align:start position:0%

constitutional provisions
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
to what i said uh on the previous cacr

the

02:33:18.830 --> 02:33:18.840 align:start position:0%

targeted source of uh
 
02:33:24.469 --> 02:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
income or the target that would uh be
 
02:33:24.479 --> 02:33:25.349 align:start position:0%
income or the target that would uh be
prohibited

02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh which this this prohibition would uh
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
preclude from taxation
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
um where a broad-based sales tax in this
 
02:33:33.359 --> 02:33:34.870 align:start position:0%
um where a broad-based sales tax in this
case

02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
is a term that different people have
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
defined differently in different
 
02:33:41.510 --> 02:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
settings the tax foundation in
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
particular has
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
identified a sales tax that has
 
02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:47.590 align:start position:0%
identified a sales tax that has
significant

02:33:47.590 --> 02:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
exemptions from products that are not
 
02:33:51.030 --> 02:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
subject to it
 
02:33:53.990 --> 02:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
um as not broad-based so what is what
 
02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:54.389 align:start position:0%
um as not broad-based so what is what
isn't

02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:33:57.590 --> 02:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know um but uh
 
02:34:00.389 --> 02:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
those are my two uh points with regard
 
02:34:00.399 --> 02:34:01.349 align:start position:0%
those are my two uh points with regard
to

02:34:01.349 --> 02:34:01.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:05.670 --> 02:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:08.710 align:start position:0%
this proposal
representative

02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.750 --> 02:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i just wanted to point out we
 
02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
have a long history in this state of not
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislating by referendum uh
 
02:34:21.030 --> 02:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
which i mean just look at california
 
02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
what a mess
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
made of itself by doing that and these
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
two proposals would both uh
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
if they were passed by the population
 
02:34:35.349 --> 02:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
on make it almost certain that it's some
 
02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
future date in our state
 
02:34:40.150 --> 02:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
our state would be up against a wall so
 
02:34:40.160 --> 02:34:41.110 align:start position:0%
our state would be up against a wall so
badly

02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
badly
 
02:34:43.990 --> 02:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
that we would end up either with anarchy

i need a motion for that
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative brummie here i'll um
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
barbie wants to itl this uh but i guess
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
we'll retain it
 
02:38:41.830 --> 02:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
so motion to retain he makes a motion to
 
02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:43.590 align:start position:0%
so motion to retain he makes a motion to
retain

02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
retain
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
house bill 346. second representative
 
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.030 --> 02:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
and he just you want to speak to the
 
02:39:08.790 --> 02:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
emotion representative
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
of romney well uh he
 
02:39:15.030 --> 02:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative edwards came in with a
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
bill but then he also came in with an
 
02:39:16.640 --> 02:39:19.190 align:start position:0%
bill but then he also came in with an
amendment

02:39:19.190 --> 02:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment basically took the money
 
02:39:24.630 --> 02:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
from domestic violence funds and put it
 
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
into the general fund
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then he was going to turn around and
 
02:39:28.399 --> 02:39:30.230 align:start position:0%
and then he was going to turn around and
somehow

02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
fund domestic violence
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh because he's one of the chairs of the
 
02:39:40.870 --> 02:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
of finance and i'm sitting here going
 
02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
wow that's all nice but
 
02:39:47.750 --> 02:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh then you don't need this build
 
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh if you think you can do it all your
 
02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh if you think you can do it all your
own

02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead and besides the point
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
is that we'd still have to even if we
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
passed something
 
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the senate and
 
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
and by that point the budget would have
 
02:40:06.710 --> 02:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
been done and this is all moot so
 
02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh again my brother's just to itl it but
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
i'm retaining it
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
just to uh to minimize the amount of uh
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
of uh bills that we have to deal with on
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
02:40:23.990 --> 02:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr
 
02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:24.790 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr
chairman

02:40:24.790 --> 02:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:40:27.910 --> 02:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
on is it my understanding that
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
if we retain it and uh it is not
 
02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise solved that on
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative edwards had said that he
 
02:40:40.790 --> 02:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
was going to come back
 
02:40:43.910 --> 02:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
next year if we passed this and
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
with a permanent funding source which
 
02:40:47.190 --> 02:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
his solution
 
02:40:50.710 --> 02:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
is not um it is only for this term
 
02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
if it passed the senate and the governor
 
02:40:58.230 --> 02:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
on so um would we
 
02:41:01.990 --> 02:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
be retaining it in order to listen to
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
his next suggestion
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
in the fall i would say yes but
 
02:41:10.389 --> 02:41:10.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not hopeful we're going to
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
hear something that
 
02:41:17.830 --> 02:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
we could act on but you know it could be
 
02:41:21.269 --> 02:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
but uh um we're just retaining it
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
just so that to be honest with you we're
 
02:41:26.070 --> 02:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
retaining it
 
02:41:27.990 --> 02:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to deal with it as
 
02:41:30.550 --> 02:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
a full bod a full house
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the next session
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
because we we're trying to minimize the
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
number of bills we have to deal with
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
on the floor any further discussion
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative sellsworth uh thank
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
although i support idl itl sorry
 
02:41:52.790 --> 02:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good compromise and um
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
really we don't need to rush it this
 
02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
really we don't need to rush it this
year

02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%

representative tudor makes a motion to

02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
but some terror makes the motion retain
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
on house bill 400 second goodbye
 
02:44:15.990 --> 02:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you mr chair
 
02:44:22.389 --> 02:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
hb 400 needs additional work to find out
 
02:44:24.070 --> 02:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
whether anyone has actually registered
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
to um collect this tax so we'd like to
 
02:44:31.670 --> 02:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
delay it so that we can get the aj in
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:39.349 --> 02:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ames
 
02:44:42.309 --> 02:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you well i'll vote for retain
 
02:44:42.319 --> 02:44:42.710 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you well i'll vote for retain
but

02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh i must say that it doesn't seem
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
necessary to retain this bill when it's
 
02:44:49.439 --> 02:44:50.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to retain this bill when it's
clearly

02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:50.810 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
02:44:50.810 --> 02:44:52.150 align:start position:0%
clearly
[Music]

02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
not needed and i i would think it would
 
02:44:57.750 --> 02:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
be better to dispose of it but
 
02:45:01.110 --> 02:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
yes we can all learn from information
 
02:45:02.550 --> 02:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
provided by the attorney general's
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
office on what's happening
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
and so i see that as a positive i'll be
 
02:45:10.469 --> 02:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
voting for retention
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
02:45:17.030 --> 02:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i also will vote for
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
retain because we have new members who
 
02:45:21.030 --> 02:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
haven't been through what we went
 
02:45:22.630 --> 02:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
through last term
 
02:45:25.030 --> 02:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
however we know that it is extremely
 
02:45:27.110 --> 02:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to get the attorney general's
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
office to show
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
up on to talk with us on
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
we had the governor's legal counsel last
 
02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:34.870 align:start position:0%
we had the governor's legal counsel last
time

02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether he still is the
 
02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
governor's legal counsel i haven't heard
 
02:45:40.830 --> 02:45:40.840 align:start position:0%
his name for quite a while
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
um and it was his job to be a real
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:44.870 align:start position:0%
um and it was his job to be a real
liaison

02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
liaison
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
but on there is um
 
02:45:50.070 --> 02:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office itself has
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
always been difficult
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes totally outside their own
 
02:45:56.389 --> 02:45:56.399 align:start position:0%
control because they had court cases
 
02:45:59.110 --> 02:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
when we wanted them to show up so i do
 
02:45:59.120 --> 02:45:59.830 align:start position:0%
when we wanted them to show up so i do
hope

02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
hope
 
02:46:02.950 --> 02:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
that on we can get
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
somebody i'm not sure who the governor's
 
02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:06.399 align:start position:0%
legal counsel
 
02:46:08.469 --> 02:46:08.479 align:start position:0%
is now but maybe it would be useful to
 
02:46:10.469 --> 02:46:10.479 align:start position:0%
try to go after that person too if it's
 
02:46:12.309 --> 02:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
for mello that would be terrific
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i do have a contact
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
over there and i plan on bringing them
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:25.750 --> 02:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
a representative brandi
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment that
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative ames i i
 
02:46:33.030 --> 02:46:33.040 align:start position:0%

02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
i have my brothers i just i tal this as
 
02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:36.070 align:start position:0%
i have my brothers i just i tal this as
well

02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh we spent a lot of time on this on
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:46:41.590 --> 02:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
we've we've built a nice fence around
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
02:46:46.389 --> 02:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh and it seems to be holding
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
although we're hearing some rumblings of
 
02:46:50.230 --> 02:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
some people
 
02:46:52.550 --> 02:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
uh some states trying to start
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
collecting but
 
02:46:57.190 --> 02:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
minimal stories minimal uh so
 
02:46:59.910 --> 02:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh then but retaining it it gives us a
 
02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:01.190 align:start position:0%
uh then but retaining it it gives us a
vehicle

02:47:01.190 --> 02:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
to study it uh i think we need to
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
address the issue
 
02:47:06.469 --> 02:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
we haven't it's been a couple of years
 
02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:08.399 align:start position:0%
now so we might as well
 
02:47:11.190 --> 02:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
let's study it let's study where we're
 
02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:11.910 align:start position:0%

in being involved in this as well
 
02:47:23.510 --> 02:47:23.520 align:start position:0%

some testimony on this bill
 
02:50:08.710 --> 02:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
i think we still need to study this
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
further there there's
 
02:50:14.230 --> 02:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
concern about taking ten percent um
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
out of the current um l-ship
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
and um you know i we just need to study
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
this further to make sure that we
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
understand the implications that can
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:31.870 --> 02:50:31.880 align:start position:0%

representative bond it could also be
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
stated that there are many counties that
 
02:50:40.309 --> 02:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
are actually making
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
good faith efforts at doing their
 
02:50:45.269 --> 02:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
restoration including rockingham county
 
02:50:48.230 --> 02:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
rockingham spends 90 000 on the
 
02:50:50.710 --> 02:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
restoration of records every year
 
02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
it spends another 60 000 on the
 
02:50:55.750 --> 02:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
restoration of their cd-roms
 
02:50:58.950 --> 02:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
so uh you know most most
 
02:51:02.790 --> 02:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
registrars of deed are a profit center
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
for most counties uh they do generate
 
02:51:08.710 --> 02:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
revenues and there should be money there
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
to restore the records
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%

02:51:25.190 --> 02:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i have heard
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the registers of deeds that on
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
the only county which is not doing what
 
02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
they are mandated to do in the statutes
 
02:51:34.080 --> 02:51:35.030 align:start position:0%
they are mandated to do in the statutes
to

02:51:35.030 --> 02:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:51:37.670 --> 02:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
repair their records is carroll county
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
which is the one behind this bill
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
on and in fact one county
 
02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
coast has been
 
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
does not get enough money out of the
 
02:51:50.150 --> 02:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
registered deeds but is still
 
02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
appropriating money
 
02:51:55.190 --> 02:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
from other sources to pay for
 
02:51:57.750 --> 02:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
preserving their records so i think that
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
we ought to
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
take a look at what is happening with
 
02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
the funding source that
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
was specified in in our statutes
 
02:52:09.830 --> 02:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
and how it's being used in the different
 
02:52:12.790 --> 02:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
counties thank you
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%

representative baxter will work with the
dra

02:54:09.349 --> 02:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
dra
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with an amendment to clarify
 
02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:14.469 align:start position:0%
to come up with an amendment to clarify
that

02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:18.070 --> 02:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
and then we'll do a regular work session
 
02:54:19.349 --> 02:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
on house bill 10
 
02:54:22.550 --> 02:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so we have those two bills
 
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
to attend to tomorrow
 
02:54:30.790 --> 02:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.230 --> 02:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
we made good progress so
 
02:54:36.230 --> 02:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
bill you know there's a number of bills
 
02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
that we retain
 
02:54:41.429 --> 02:54:41.439 align:start position:0%
that probably should have been itl
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
but every bill that goes to the floor
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
for itl
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
and uh you know what happened this past
 
02:54:57.349 --> 02:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
session there's 35 bills we didn't get
 
02:54:57.359 --> 02:54:59.349 align:start position:0%
session there's 35 bills we didn't get
to

02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:55:03.510 --> 02:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
so i think personally
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
i think we made the right decision on
 
02:55:08.230 --> 02:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
how to handle these things
 
02:55:11.990 --> 02:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh anything else
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
then if not we're through
 
02:55:20.950 --> 02:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the day and we'll be
 
02:55:22.469 --> 02:55:22.479 align:start position:0%
back tomorrow
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
morning at nine o'clock to deal with
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 10 and house bill 15.
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
i want to remind you that
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
i sent out an email
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
that a request from the
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
finance committee represented weiler and
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
represented over
 
02:55:51.590 --> 02:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
and it identifies those parts of hb2
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
that will affect the revenues
 
02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
they've been identified so once
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
hb2 available it should be available
 
02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:03.110 align:start position:0%
hb2 available it should be available
online

02:56:03.110 --> 02:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
online
 
02:56:05.830 --> 02:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
you need to take a look at that because
 
02:56:07.670 --> 02:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
when we meet on the 10th
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
i want to go over all these because
 
02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
actually i'd like like to get some
 
02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:14.389 align:start position:0%
actually i'd like like to get some
feedback

02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
02:56:16.950 --> 02:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee prior to that
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
if i could
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
to help them do their job
 
02:56:24.950 --> 02:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
and then we have five bills that were
 
02:56:26.630 --> 02:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
the second committee
 
02:56:30.150 --> 02:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
on which we'll deal with on the 10th
 
02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
of this month
 
02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
am i right in thinking that hb2 has not
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
shown up yet
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
it hadn't as of late yesterday afternoon
 
02:56:49.590 --> 02:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
i haven't checked it this morning
 
02:56:51.990 --> 02:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
obviously haven't had much time
 
02:56:56.389 --> 02:56:56.399 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i didn't know how to read that
 
02:56:56.399 --> 02:56:56.950 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i didn't know how to read that
note

02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:57:01.590 --> 02:57:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:03.750 --> 02:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative tucker did you say
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
something yeah i don't think i
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
understood that note that i got maybe
 
02:57:09.910 --> 02:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
you could send it again
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
or for some reason it
 
02:57:15.910 --> 02:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't have a clue what it
 
02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:16.950 align:start position:0%
didn't i didn't have a clue what it
meant

02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
meant
 
02:57:19.990 --> 02:57:20.000 align:start position:0%
well i i will give you a call
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative tucker and go over it
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
with you
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay essentially on house bill 2
 
02:57:31.190 --> 02:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
is 169 pages
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
and then the finance committee
 
02:57:34.319 --> 02:57:35.190 align:start position:0%
and then the finance committee
identified

02:57:35.190 --> 02:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
those items in those pages
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
that they would want input from the ways
 
02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
and means
 
02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
committee so if we take
 
02:57:49.030 --> 02:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
that note that i sent you with those
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
papers with those page numbers
 
02:57:55.830 --> 02:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
and look at the at the note
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
and it gives the items then that's what
 
02:58:01.030 --> 02:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
you want to look up
 
02:58:03.670 --> 02:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay i'll do that thank you have to go
 
02:58:07.830 --> 02:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:11.190 --> 02:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
what they're modifying on the rsas
 
02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then we've got to come up with what
 
02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
it means to them
 
02:58:22.309 --> 02:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:25.830 --> 02:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
i add that the note
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
i think it was represent over who's
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
who said something about the references
 
02:58:37.269 --> 02:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
they were they're using a draft hb2
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
that they have and she said that
 
02:58:44.950 --> 02:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
she thought that the official hb2 would
 
02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:45.590 align:start position:0%
she thought that the official hb2 would
be

02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:58:49.030 --> 02:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
have similar pagination and maybe it's
 
02:58:49.040 --> 02:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
have similar pagination and maybe it's
more

02:58:49.510 --> 02:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:58:51.990 --> 02:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
more importantly section numbers but
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
watch for that because
 
02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:02.790 --> 02:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:06.389 --> 02:59:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you on when we've done this
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
before and i don't know if we could get
 
02:59:09.830 --> 02:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
it now but either have
 
02:59:13.349 --> 02:59:13.359 align:start position:0%

02:59:20.389 --> 02:59:20.399 align:start position:0%
that we are supposed to look at and then
 
02:59:22.150 --> 02:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
02:59:25.030 --> 02:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
and then send them to us i have a
 
02:59:25.040 --> 02:59:25.830 align:start position:0%
and then send them to us i have a
question

02:59:25.830 --> 02:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:59:29.910 --> 02:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
about on whether if we look at the
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
um at the front pages
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
that are the index of hb2 which have no
 
02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
page number references on and
 
02:59:43.269 --> 02:59:43.279 align:start position:0%
you can't search by section number on
 
02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
then uh can we uh
 
02:59:49.750 --> 02:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
if we find something that we think deals
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
with the dedicated fund that we should
 
02:59:52.950 --> 02:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
have done something about
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
or affects uh affects the tax revenue
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
could we add that to the list or not yes
 
03:00:06.710 --> 03:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
this week and i'll probably stop this
 
03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon because
 
03:00:13.590 --> 03:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
when that meeting is happening on is to
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
take and pull out
 
03:00:18.870 --> 03:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
from hb2 and put it into one document
 
03:00:22.309 --> 03:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
those areas that they want us to look at
 
03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
and then you know start looking at hb2
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
what other areas they didn't identify
 
03:00:32.230 --> 03:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
that we should be looking at
 
03:00:34.230 --> 03:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
and i'll add that to the document but
 
03:00:36.830 --> 03:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
i'll get the first document out right
 
03:00:39.590 --> 03:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
away thank you but we have to wait till
 
03:00:41.510 --> 03:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
they've given us the official one with
 
03:00:43.269 --> 03:00:43.279 align:start position:0%
its own pagination
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
on can i offer suggestions if i do the
 
03:00:47.830 --> 03:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
once it's there thank you
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%

03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:09.190 --> 03:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
march is a big month of revenues
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
and come probably around the 5th or so
 
03:01:16.150 --> 03:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
we'll have a good idea i hope maybe the
 
03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:16.790 align:start position:0%
we'll have a good idea i hope maybe the
28th

03:01:16.790 --> 03:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
28th
 
03:01:20.309 --> 03:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
or 29th and then we need to start
 
03:01:20.319 --> 03:01:21.590 align:start position:0%
or 29th and then we need to start
looking

03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%

03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:25.990 align:start position:0%
at what's happening and is that going to
affect

03:01:25.990 --> 03:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
affect
 
03:01:28.950 --> 03:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
the projections that we have put in so
 
03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
we really need to look at those things
 
03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
and then we'll have to do the same thing
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
in april
 
03:01:39.590 --> 03:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
