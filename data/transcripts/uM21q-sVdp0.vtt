and what i'd like to maybe propose is
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
we'll take each bill um in order um
 
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
we'll maybe have a as part of the work
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
discussion um
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
have a discussion refresh ourselves what
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
the bill is about maybe talk about a
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
um the what kind of testimony we heard
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
and when
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
we have ended that exchange um
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
i will move into executive session on
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
that bill and look for a motion of
 
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:44.870 align:start position:0%
that bill and look for a motion of
either

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
legislation or not to recommend for

future legislation
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
we'll take a roll call vote um and we'll
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
do that with the second bill and then um
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
we can go home or we are home
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%

zoom from
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%

all right so um from work session
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
perspective um we're going to open
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
a work session on hb 1199
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
relative to telephone costs for county
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
prisoners and just to kick it off
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
first part part of the the bill of the
 
00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
analysis section and then we can open it
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
up for
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
discussion um the analysis this bill
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
requires that the fee charged by the
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
county department
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
of corrections for prisoners use of the
 
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
telephone service
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
not exceed the county's costs provide
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
that service
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
so we heard this bill i believe on um
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
january 16th so it's been a a few months
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
since we've had that discussion
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so i will open it up for
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
any comments or
 
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions or discussion i did hear from
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative keynes um saying that
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
she hopes the committee recommends this
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
and raise your hand if you'd like to
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah representative lucas has his hand
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
up representative lucas lucas
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i was interested in this um i spoke
 
00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
yeah i was interested in this um i spoke
with

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative keynes about it back you
 
00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.110 align:start position:0%
representative keynes about it back you
know

00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
earlier and followed up with i think
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's laura montenegro the person who
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
spoke from the new hampshire department
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
of corrections
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
and they have uh an interesting way of
 
00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
doing the state prison which
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
might be uh you know could be used maybe
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the jails the county jails um
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
although it would take some work to
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know if there's any issues with
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
that and then more recently in the last
 
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
week or so i spoke with arizona teens
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
again and she's
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
interested in following up on that and
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
trying to make it happen i think the
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is a good idea
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the question is going to be you know
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
how did the different counties do it and
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
could they adopt the state system
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
are there any problems with it so i
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
would support moving forward with this
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i agree with
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative lucas um
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
i thought this seemed to be a pressing
 
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.830 align:start position:0%
i thought this seemed to be a pressing
issue

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm not sure how we do this
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
with um interim study bills saying we
 
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a chance to study
 
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.830 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a chance to study
these

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
could we if we moved it forward as
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
recommended for
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
future legislation could we say in the
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
report that
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are some issues that need to be
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
addressed and that studying this
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea before filing a
 
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.510 align:start position:0%
might be a good idea before filing a
bill

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
um chris christine is that
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's part of our report can that be
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
included you can certainly put in any
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you think could uh
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
improve uh the bill okay
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i think this is a good bill um
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of good testimony in
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
favor of it
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
and uh i just reread the bill again and
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have any problem with it i'm
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually a big proponent of user fees
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
paying for public services through user
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
fees instead of through taxes
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the kind of uh
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
principles of paying for things through
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
user fees is that you
 
00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
try to keep the cost you know as closely
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
as possible match uh
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of providing the service um
 
00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so i think the bill is as well
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
written as is
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
as it can be so i don't think that i'm
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
not sure that it's even possible
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
actually go ahead and implement it with
 
00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:23.919 align:start position:0%
anything else attached to it
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative dolan thank you mr
 
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.750 align:start position:0%
okay representative dolan thank you mr

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
i uh i think of recidivism rates when i
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
think of this bill and i think that
 
00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
if we can keep people close to their
 
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.430 align:start position:0%
if we can keep people close to their
families

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
or closer to their families i think we
 
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
we give them a better chance of when
 
00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
we give them a better chance of when
they

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
get out back into the public that
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to stay out and not
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
and not repeat so i think keep keeping
 
00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:51.029 align:start position:0%
and not repeat so i think keep keeping
them

00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
tied to their families uh via telephone
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
is a is a good
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay um i you're reviewing my
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
recollection was i'm just confirming
 
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
that looking through the
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes was that um laura
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
montenegro from the depart
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of corrections
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
um talked about what they did the state
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
level and i believe that was
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
a really good option for maybe to look
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
at at the county level and
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you know that could be also
 
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
included in our
 
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
minutes on the from this meeting
 
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.510 align:start position:0%
minutes on the from this meeting
recommendation

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.029 --> 00:21:31.039 align:start position:0%
representative lucas another question
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
and that's i i spoke with laura
 
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
and that's i i spoke with laura
montenegro

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
montenegro
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
and keynes and i think what what needs
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
to be looked into and i'm not
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
saying the commitment should do it and
 
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not going to drive it but i
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
suggested that
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative keane's uh i'll look
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
into his
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
what would it take to get the state
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
system used you know by the counties and
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
the question there is you know would
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
there be startup costs
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
if we mandated a constitutional 28a
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
violation i mean there are some issues
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
to look into but i think the state
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
system is actually pretty clever
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
um the way it works and they have um
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
they have these pat like pads
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
notepad things available they have some
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
number available for loan
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
and not only they can be used for phone
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
calls but the prisoners can
 
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
do limited email there's some control on
 
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
that and also um
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
you know purchase movie and videos and
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
stuff and actually
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the way they fund the phone calls is
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
um through kind of the voluntary use of
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
and in effect the cost of the phone
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
calls to the prisoners is almost zero
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh but i don't know what would be
 
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
involved in uh making those available in
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
the counties and startup costs and all
 
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
the counties and startup costs and all
that

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
so that's i think what needs to be
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
looked into
 
00:22:59.830 --> 00:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair this is laurel davis i'm i'm
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
having a little trouble finding the
 
00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
ray's hand
 
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
yep no uh i'm sorry oh if you click
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
on your computer under participants if
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
you click on that
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
on then it should show you an option
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
under everybody's name to raise your
 
00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:16.789 align:start position:0%
under everybody's name to raise your
hand

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yep and i apologize it
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
seems like there's some logging going on
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
up the road there's some heavy truck
 
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:22.950 align:start position:0%
up the road there's some heavy truck
traffic

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
if there's noise i apologize for that um
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
i i agree that this sounds like a great
 
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.950 align:start position:0%
i i agree that this sounds like a great
idea

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
idea
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
here in stratford county we work pretty
 
00:23:42.789 --> 00:23:42.799 align:start position:0%
hard at getting our
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh prisoners back into the community and
 
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.909 align:start position:0%
uh prisoners back into the community and
working

00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible and it has worked
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
out pretty well for us
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
my one concern is will we
 
00:23:57.190 --> 00:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
need a financial note concerning uh
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
setting this up in counties that have
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
met the uh the
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
met the requirements of the of the of
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's my only point okay so future
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would have to take that into
 
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.149 align:start position:0%
legislation would have to take that into
consideration

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
um representative levin uh
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair and colleagues
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm very interested in people's
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
comments and i'm
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
glad that representative likas explained
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
to us a bit about how it works at the
 
00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
state because i really
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
didn't know and um i'm on the
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
delegation with representative kittridge
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
and i know that our jail
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
here works very hard to keep prisoners
 
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
in touch with their fam
 
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
inmates in touch with their families i
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
would almost
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
i i'm on the edge of saying let's keep
 
00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.029 align:start position:0%
i i'm on the edge of saying let's keep
this

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
to almost zero because there are inmates
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
who don't have income who can't pay for
 
00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
a phone call
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
and then there are other inmates who who
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
do have money
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
and are provided with some money by
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
their families and can rent a movie or
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
rent a video or a game and and that's a
 
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
positive thing yet
 
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
i'm really thinking about the people who
 
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.070 align:start position:0%
i'm really thinking about the people who
have

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
yes it's a cost to the jail i understand
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
it but i think it's a benefit to the
 
00:25:17.679 --> 00:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
it but i think it's a benefit to the
community

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
if we keep the
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
telephone link between inmates and their
 
00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
telephone link between inmates and their
families

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
families
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
as cheap inexpensive as possible
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
um and i know this bill may address it
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
in some way so that's all i wanted to
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative stavis
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
um i agree with what everyone has said
 
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
so far
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
my only concern about this bill as it is
 
00:25:47.279 --> 00:25:48.310 align:start position:0%
my only concern about this bill as it is
written

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
is that it really leaves it up to the
 
00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:51.909 align:start position:0%
is that it really leaves it up to the
county

00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the cost is
 
00:25:59.430 --> 00:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just wanting a little bit
 
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.269 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just wanting a little bit
more

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:00.279 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
accountability about that and is is
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
there some way that we could
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
um include that maybe in a financial
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
note or or
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill itself as a kind of a
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so mike just to get back on
 
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
track here we're
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
we're not looking to either amend this
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
bill or anything like that
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
what what has to happen at this point in
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
this legislative session is somebody
 
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
this legislative session is somebody
else

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
maybe representative keynes would put
 
00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.029 align:start position:0%
maybe representative keynes would put
pen

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
pen
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
together a new piece of legislation for
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
for 2021 and resubmit the bill
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
um so at this point we can we could have
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
if we had comments we probably could
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
include them in a report that we
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
associate with it but um it will be
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
brand new legislation
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um representative leckas
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i suppose i mean that was my
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
understanding and i told representative
 
00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:56.559 align:start position:0%
keynes that you know i supported the
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
idea and if she wanted i wasn't going to
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
drive it but if she wanted to
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh proceed you know next time i'd i'd be
 
00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
glad to work with her and maybe sponsor
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
it and if anybody else has particular
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
ideas maybe talk with her and
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.149 --> 00:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'm supportive of uh uh sending
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
this to
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh on for future legislation and i would
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
join in representatives uh with some
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh input because we've been having some
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
incidents and
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
at the rockingham county jail but they
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
don't involve long-term
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
inmates uh so there needs to be some
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
consideration for
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
people who are there for a short period
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
like maybe even just overnight getting a
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
phone call
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
because we've had incidences where
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
people don't get phone calls and they're
 
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.230 align:start position:0%
people don't get phone calls and they're
released

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
released
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
and have no way to get anywhere or call
 
00:27:54.399 --> 00:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
and have no way to get anywhere or call
anyone

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
so that would be my thing to consider
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
while in the new legislation
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
okay very good i don't see any of their
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
hands raised does anybody else have
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
um i don't see anybody
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
hey hello this is kevin representative
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
pratt yes i'm looking for my phone i'm
 
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:24.399 align:start position:0%
in favor of the program
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
um i think it should be self-sufficient
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
all paying for itself
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should uh fund it it
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
used to be a program in rockingham and i
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
know a lot of other county jails where
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
inmates could earn money by doing
 
00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.430 align:start position:0%
inmates could earn money by doing
different

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
jobs around the jail uh if they want to
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
make a phone call they could
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
actually do a little work and pay for
 
00:28:43.669 --> 00:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
the phone call themselves
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
so i think uh cutting down on the profit
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
is a good idea
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
the jail shouldn't make a large profit
 
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
on the call but it should be
 
00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
on the call but it should be
self-sufficient

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient
 
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.630 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient
okay

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say thank you all
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
right i'm in favor of the bill thank you
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
last call okay representative mcdonald

be in favor recommending that for future
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislation or not uh starting off
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
you mr chair i do recommend that this go
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
forward for future legislation
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
um we worked hard on a bill to help with
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh which is now kind of sitting on
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
somebody's table
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
we do have a crisis in this state for
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
and this is a way to allow
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling to pay for
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
their homes and people who are having a
 
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
hard time finding a place to live
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
to join forces and i think it makes
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
sense um
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
it would be an easy fix and um i
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
i would like to see a program like this
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative dorje yes
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh i support moving this forward for
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
future legislation
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
i want to bring out two things that came
 
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
i want to bring out two things that came
up

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the previous discussion of it which
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
considered for the future legislation
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
one is that the
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
line two talks about amending rsa 72
 
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.870 align:start position:0%
line two talks about amending rsa 72
7237b

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
7237b
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
3b uh it really should be 3a
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
at the end uh it's it's addressing the
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
wrong section of the rsa
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
all right and the other one is that
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
there was comments about not talking
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
about works here but just saying that
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
um if you have rent
 
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh if you have rental income for someone
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's living with you
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh that it not be included as part of
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
your income uh
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
the income test for the uh the exemption
 
00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:56.230 align:start position:0%
the income test for the uh the exemption
so

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh maybe some wording changes uh would
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um representative yeah i agree with uh
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative darjee especially on the
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
latter part there was all kinds of
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
uh text in there about various things
 
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
that are nice ideas but really
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
you know didn't have any effect and i
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
don't see any point including that in
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
statute you know
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
people helping each other those
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
arrangements which might be nice but
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
you know if it's gonna go forward keep
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
it clean to just uh
 
00:34:30.149 --> 00:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
you know you know what the real uh um
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
key is for what effect it would have
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
good enough um i don't
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
see any other hands up um i i also
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
um i think it should be go for future
 
00:34:44.399 --> 00:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
um i think it should be go for future
legislation

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
um i i agree with um
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative porter um affordable
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
housing is is a real issue and if we can
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
if people can
 
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
um have other folks living with them in
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
a home
 
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
sharing arrangement that is certainly a
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
good way of moving forward and it
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't count against you if
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
if you you're still trying to make ends
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
meet so
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
um representative porter i'm
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative i
 
00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i couldn't i saw your your
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
i couldn't quickly find my ray's hand
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
button all right so
 
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes um i agree with everything that
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative darjee said
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
and others um and i just i think one
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
point that really has to be
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
clarified legally is the issue
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
related to um any rental income
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
not affecting a person's eligibility for
 
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.829 align:start position:0%
not affecting a person's eligibility for
medicaid

00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
or or services that are related to
 
00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
or or services that are related to
medicaid

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
i i don't know that if we pass
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
legislation uh saying that yes it does
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
that that would necessarily um
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
pass muster uh
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
with medicaid um and the feds so
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
i that that question is the only
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
question i in my mind that really needs
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
to be answered
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
um and the folks from medicaid would be
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
the people who would
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
um say uh thumbs up or thumbs down
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
if that is something that could uh
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
actually occur
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
that a person any additional income
 
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.950 align:start position:0%
that a person any additional income
would

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh not be counted toward eligibility for
 
00:36:23.829 --> 00:36:23.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid that that's the question i
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think needs to be answered okay thank
 
00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.270 align:start position:0%
i think needs to be answered okay thank
you

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you again mr
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
chairman you're right representative
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
marmocat i agree on that point
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh one thing i just wanted to bring
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
forward was the idea that when we were
 
00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
talking about the um
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
affordable housing bills that came out
 
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
of the governor's task force
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of the incentives that was used to
 
00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.550 align:start position:0%
one of the incentives that was used to
help

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
developers move forward with projects
 
00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
was to give them
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
a a break on taxes so i don't think
 
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.190 align:start position:0%
a a break on taxes so i don't think
giving

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
giving
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
people who are house sharing like this a
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
break on their taxes is out of
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
bounds done before with other bills that
 
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:02.870 align:start position:0%
bounds done before with other bills that
are

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
attempting to address this issue
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
it's just that it's property taxes we're
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
talking about here rather than business
 
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.069 align:start position:0%
talking about here rather than business
taxes

00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
but they are still taxes so
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
okay um i don't see other any other
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
hands raised would anybody else like to
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
add to the conversation before we go
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative abramson uh
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm re-reading the bill a third time
 
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes you read a bill and you get a
 
00:37:31.589 --> 00:37:31.599 align:start position:0%
different uh
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
impression of it i think that the the
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
language of the bill is pretty
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
clear and straightforward it just says
 
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:38.950 align:start position:0%
clear and straightforward it just says
uh

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is house bill 1305
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's simply adding in language that says
 
00:37:47.349 --> 00:37:47.359 align:start position:0%
for clarity shall not include income
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
from a home share arrangement
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
in which the applicant receives
 
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
assistance with housework or other
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living in exchange
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
for reduced rent
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know anywhere else in federal
 
00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
tax code or anywhere else
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
where a discount gets considered as
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
income or a discount in exchange for
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
work is ever considered as
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
as income i have have had housemates in
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
my house over the years where they
 
00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to pay
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
and they received some kind of discount
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
on their rent in exchange for doing yard
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
work or some such thing
 
00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i think currently the
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
most agencies that i've dealt with have
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
already said
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't get counted as income when
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
when people are in such a dire situation
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
that they they're having such a hard
 
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
time work
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
having such a hard time finding work
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
outside of the home
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
that they have to work around the home
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
around the house or
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
apartment complex where they live in
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
exchange for a discount um
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
i want to i wanted to quote some
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
irs uh publication that agrees with me
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
on this but i
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
it's been several years so i can't
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
reference it but
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
discounts are usually not considered um
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
income as it is
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative yeah i
 
00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
just want to um
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
refer and uh representative abramson i'm
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
what you are specifically referring to
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm referring to
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
roman numeral six that reads any income
 
00:39:22.069 --> 00:39:22.079 align:start position:0%
from a home share arrangement
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
in which the applicant receives
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
assistance with housework or other
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living in exchange
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
for reduced rent
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
shall be excluded from income from
 
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:32.150 align:start position:0%
shall be excluded from income from
purposes

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
for purposes of determining eligibility
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
for public assistance
 
00:39:38.069 --> 00:39:38.079 align:start position:0%
including medical assistance and food
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
stamps provided that if eligibility for
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
the assistance program is governed by
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines
 
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh such income shall be disregarded to
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
the extent
 
00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
permitted by federal law so
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
i guess there is a clarifying point
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
there uh and i understand that it's just
 
00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
that i think this issue
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
just needs to be cleared up you know we
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to get in the middle of
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
um eligibility issues and i i just think
 
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:04.790 align:start position:0%
um eligibility issues and i i just think
it

00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
it just needs further clarification
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
before it even gets implemented
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
that's all i was trying to say okay
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%

00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
conversation before we go
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:23.589 --> 00:40:23.599 align:start position:0%

community bridges is one of 10 area
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
agencies that support people with
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and acquired
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
brain disorders
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to say thank you to
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
the committee um
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
for taking this so seriously
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of the ways that we support people
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities
 
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our region and throughout this state
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
is with something called
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced family care and it is a shared
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
living opportunity for people with
 
00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.190 align:start position:0%
living opportunity for people with
disabilities

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
to live essentially in a foster care
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
type situation but it's
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
for adults and so they share their home
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
with staff and providers
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
who assist in their daily living
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
experience as a result um
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
the the folks that are um
 
00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
that are helping to assist with the
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
person with a disability
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
receives a stipend um for those services
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
and um so i would just caution you
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
i do not know tax law as representative
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
abramson was talking about he certainly
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
knows more about it than i do
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
um but i did want to just echo something
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
um that had been said previously which
 
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
um that had been said previously which
is

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
whatever you decide to do i would just
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
caution you
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
that there may be
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
folks that you haven't considered like
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.670 align:start position:0%
folks that you haven't considered like
those

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
in a home share or enhanced family care
 
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.349 align:start position:0%
in a home share or enhanced family care
option

00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
option
 
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
um that relies on medicaid in order to
 
00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.190 align:start position:0%
um that relies on medicaid in order to
be

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:21.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
able to access their services and so i
 
00:43:24.319 --> 00:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
able to access their services and so i
just

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
i just think that it's very very
 
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.069 align:start position:0%
i just think that it's very very
important

00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
for us to do our due diligence as a
 
00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
for us to do our due diligence as a
community

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
to assure that we don't upset
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
a very well-oiled apple cart
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
um enhanced family care is one of the
 
00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:41.359 align:start position:0%
least expensive
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
and most productive ways that we support
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
in our communities so i would just ask
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
for you to be very cognizant of that
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to work
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
with this committee or with the
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative who put forward this
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um to assure that
 
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
we don't inadvertently um
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
harm those with disabilities and i i
 
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
harm those with disabilities and i i
appreciate

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
very tricky always but especially during
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%

00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
or heather either one is fine okay is
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
there a deadline
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
for the reports i don't know that
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's a deadline but sooner than later
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
i think is is
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
probably best um i think it's too late
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
this week but um we see a calendar this
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
week's calendar but we're still
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
on every other week calendar basis we're
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
back to weekly now
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%
we tend to put all the statements in one
 
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
calendar so um we'll be working through
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
the rest of the month
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
um but as i said probably sooner than
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
later so it doesn't get lost
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay so if those people writing the
 
00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee reports needed to access the
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%

00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%

week's calendar
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
if they needed to go ahead and take a
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
look at the recording
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay for those people who uh made the
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
the motion to
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
