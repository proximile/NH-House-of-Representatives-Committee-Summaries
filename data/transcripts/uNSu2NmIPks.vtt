00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
um it would um take effect 45 days after
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
the um um after the bill was is passed
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
and the uh uh committee that is named
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
would have until November to um produce
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
a report from what you learn what what
 
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
the committee learns um um during its
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
its lifetime so I am here
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
um as as the members of this committee
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
are aware New Hampshire's lack of
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is a is a significant
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
problem in the state it's even more
 
00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 align:start position:0%
challenging for people with disabilities
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
and this is why Advocates from the
 
00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 align:start position:0%
disability Community asked me to submit
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
this bill one issue that makes it
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
difficult for people with disabilities
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
to find housing is that people who rely
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
on social security or SSI have very low
 
00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
income comes there's no way they can
 
00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:03.879 align:start position:0%
afford market rate housing another
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
consideration is the appropriateness of
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
the housing for example people with
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
mobility issues need ground floor
 
00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:12.039 align:start position:0%
apartments or access to elevators other
 
00:08:13.589 --> 00:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
people need Supportive Housing that
 
00:08:15.869 --> 00:08:15.879 align:start position:0%
include services to help them live
 
00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:17.879 align:start position:0%
independently My Hope Is that this
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
proposed committee can identify the
 
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
scope of the shortage of housing for
 
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities and identify
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
ways to provide incentives to developers
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
to build appropriate and affordable
 
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
units and ensure that these developments
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
are distributed around the state so
 
00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
people can remain in their communities
 
00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
and be close to family and friends um I
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
am going to be very brief there are a
 
00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
lot of people with a much deeper
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of these um issues and
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
challenges who are are also here to
 
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360 align:start position:0%
speak um but I am happy to answer any
 
00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:49.519 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative any
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
00:08:54.509 --> 00:08:54.519 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you for taking my question
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative um and thank you for
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
bringing forward this bill uh the last I
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
checked and this was quite some time ago
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
what we formally called Section 8 uh
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program um was something like a
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
nine-year weight list in this state and
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh do you happen to know how long the
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
weight list currently is and how long
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
specifically it is for people with
 
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities who need special
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
accommodations uh no I cannot answer
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
that question um I do know that um um
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
there are significantly long weights um
 
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.710 align:start position:0%
there are significantly long weights um
my

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:09:31.509 --> 00:09:31.519 align:start position:0%
my suspicion is that there's probably
 
00:09:33.389 --> 00:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
someone sitting behind me who has that
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
information for you and that's another
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
reason why um we need to have a special
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee to to look at this so that you
 
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
can gather all of that information and
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
find out what the scope of need is so
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question yes uh a
 
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up question um this is a would
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
you believe Mr chair uh would you
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
believe that I have a constituent that
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
lives in my own complex that I found out
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
during Bill filing last last year um she
 
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
lives on a third floor or lived I should
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
say on a third floor walk up um she lost
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
the use of her legs Midway through or
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
even just a little bit into her lease
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
and the landlord refused to let her out
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
of her lease even though that meant that
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
she would be completely bound to her
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
apartment and unable to leave um and
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
that I then filed legislation to try to
 
00:10:25.389 --> 00:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
address that issue um but if it had come
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
to this committee perhaps it would have
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
ended differently but it did not end
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
well would you believe yes I would
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
believe it and and um I think anybody in
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
this room could wake up tomorrow and
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
find themselves with a disability if and
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
you know that that's just the nature of
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
it so some folks are are born with um
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
with challenges and other people develop
 
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
them during the course of their life I'm
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
just waiting for mine to kick in thank
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
you representative any other questions
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
represent VI Kell thank you thank you
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
um this this this uh committee that
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
you're proposing seems to have a lot of
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
overlap with this this specific
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee and we did um uh specifically
 
00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
that on line 12 it says um and potential
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
remedies for
 
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
increasing the supply of housing that is
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
both affordable and suitable I think
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
that that isn't that within the scope
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
of this committee that we are trying to
 
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
address some
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
those um problems and so I'm just
 
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
wondering what what is different in your
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
mind from what this committee could have
 
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
a hearing to to listen to those same
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
people I I'm not sure of the benefit of
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
creating a whole another committee for
 
00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
that purpose um thank you for the
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
question um I was approached um by
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
people in the disability Community to um
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
submit this bill um I spoke with some
 
00:12:01.629 --> 00:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh about
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
whether um they had had you had had
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
significant testimony regarding these
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
issues and I was told that at that at
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
that point there hadn't been my goal for
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
for submitting this bill is for this
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
issue to be addressed um as I've been
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
told I'm a rookie um uh legislator and
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
as I've been told once I submit a bill
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
to a committee it then becomes yours um
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
so my goal for this is to have um
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
somebody look at um the scope of the
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
issue that's facing people with
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
disabilities when it comes to housing
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
and to um and to figure out some
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
potential ways uh to address those
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
issues so that we can create more
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
affordable and appropriate housing for
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities so thank you
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
for that question go ahead thank you
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking this followup so
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
so what what would you see as success as
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
as far as this committee
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh like the report what what do you what
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
would you envision as a su a successful
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
committee um well report if if I were to
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
be on this committee what I would be
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
looking at would be you know to define
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
the scope of the problem how many people
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
are there with disabilities who need
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
housing um to um look at determine you
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
know um
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
the the the scope of the issues with um
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
with people who hold vouchers or who
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
people who need vouchers um you know H
 
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
how many more units do we need for um
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
that where the landlords will take
 
00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.430 align:start position:0%
that where the landlords will take
vouchers

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
um and and also to kind of look at um
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
different kinds of solutions for example
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
some of it may be new construction some
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
of it may be retrofitting um you know if
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
an older person um is living in their
 
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
home and they develop significant
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
Mobility problems they may not if
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
they're on Social Security they may not
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
have the resources to retrofit their
 
00:14:13.749 --> 00:14:13.759 align:start position:0%
home in order to accommodate this new
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
disability looking at at the at the wide
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
range of ways that um housing can be
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
made appropriate for um for people with
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities and also looking at what
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
the disabilities are you know you have
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
people with physical disabilties you
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
have people with um developmental
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
disabilities you have um people with um
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh who suffer from mental illness um and
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
substance abuse disorders they need some
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
kind you know they also need um
 
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing so and and also to
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
look at the um restraints against um
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
building this kind of housing um um you
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
know for example um I I was listening um
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the uh uh to to a a phone call and it
 
00:15:03.389 --> 00:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
was a developer who had been working on
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
building Supportive Housing for adults
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities and um
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
they were having a a hard time making
 
00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:14.519 align:start position:0%
the the project work financially because
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the number of they needed to put in I
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
think it was 12 units and um the the
 
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.710 align:start position:0%
think it was 12 units and um the the
parking

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
parking
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
requirements um made it virtually
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
impossible for them to put it on the lot
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
that they had available to them and um
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
most of the people that would be living
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
in this housing did not drive for you
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
know either their disabilities prevented
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
them for driving or they couldn't afford
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
to own and maintain a car um so they you
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
know they didn't need all that parking
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
but the um but the zoning requirements
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
um uh were forcing them to put in that
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
much um parking so they had to go and
 
00:15:56.749 --> 00:15:56.759 align:start position:0%
get variances so I mean those are the
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
cuz you know people who have
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities should be able to stay in
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
their communities in Manchester we're
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
building a whole bunch of um units for
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
um people with very low incomes um and
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
there these these units are going to be
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for people with disabilities
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
um but you know everybody C with
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities shouldn't have to move to
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester to get housing I mean you
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
know if you're living in a small rural
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
community where you've lived your whole
 
00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
life and suddenly you find yourself in a
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
wheelchair you shouldn't have to move to
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
wheelchair you shouldn't have to move to
Manchester

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
so so I I think finding ways to
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
um encourage communities uh to uh
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
provide this type of housing for their
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
for their residents is is another thing
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
that the the committee could be looking
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
at okay any other questions
 
00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.470 align:start position:0%
at okay any other questions
representative

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh the Section 8 waiting
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
list was mentioned um and uh I know that
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
those are always very long um are you
 
00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
housing I'm not sure is that is that the
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
bridge housing or uh no it's
 
00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:15.039 align:start position:0%
specifically it's a HUD program that
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
provides funding for housing
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
specifically for people with
 
00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.079 align:start position:0%
disabilities so I think that uh I should
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
mention I'm a former HUD employee uh so
 
00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
I have some familiarity um that's
 
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
probably something that should be
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
considered uh when looking at
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
availability for housing for people with
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
disabilities and um perhaps local
 
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
organizations applying for uh
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
participation in the section 8 program
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
uh sorry section 811 program uh and uh
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
getting that kind of assistance to
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
create that kind of Housing and uh
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
there's a new version also that provides
 
00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
rental assistant um I'm not as familiar
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
with that but it does exist oh thank you
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
so much for providing that information
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
that and that's exactly the kind of
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
information that I would like this this
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
proposed committee to be exploring you
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
know what are the what are the assets
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
what are the resources that are
 
00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
available and you know find out what the
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
needs are find out what the resources
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
are and figure out ways to match
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
questions would the prime sponsor be
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%

looking specifically at this issue I
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
mean that's why I brought the bill
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
forward because I thought it needed
 
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.470 align:start position:0%

hi I'm representative Heidi HR
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 10 and a co-sponsor of
 
00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
the bill our 36-year-old son has a
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
disability we are a squeaky wheel our
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
son has been living in his own apartment
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
since 2012 with a furry four-legged
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
roommate our son is a lucky one there
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
are many individuals with disabilities
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
who are not able to live on their own
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
due to availability of affordable
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
housing this committee would be their
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
squeaky wheel by working with the state
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
agencies Advocates and members of the
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
disability committee to find a solution
 
00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
I feel it is important we move this
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
legislation right along to help our
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
disability Community find avoidable
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
housing we need to be their squeaky
 
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
Wheels thank you thank you are there
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
HR representative D Lorenzo hi thank you
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um what would you
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
envision as appropriate for a person in
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
your son's
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
um or someone like your son's present
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
condition would you think about
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
congregate housing um at
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
all I think it's up to the individ
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
idual um and people working with that
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
individual where my son has Aspergers
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
and he's high functioning he does have a
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
job he doesn't
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
drive but he lives on his own and that's
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%

representative

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe the prime sponsor mentioned this
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
but I'll ask the question of you
 
00:21:30.669 --> 00:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
um is it fair to say that this is a bit
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
of a double whammy situation where not
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
only do you need to deal with housing
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities but very
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
frequently many of those people with
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
disabilities are living on limited
 
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.080 align:start position:0%
incomes usually Social Security
 
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
disability income which further makes it
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to find housing
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
especially in our current
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
market thank you for the question um not
 
00:21:59.070 --> 00:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
sure how to answer it but there
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
are project vouchers out there that
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
would help with lowincome
 
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.830 align:start position:0%
would help with lowincome
disabilities

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.510 align:start position:0%
disabilities
people

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's it yeah
 
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:16.360 align:start position:0%
yeah okay any other questions thank you
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative next up I'm going to call
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.630 align:start position:0%
 
Howard

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.269 --> 00:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington and
 
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on the bill uh I
 
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:40.360 align:start position:0%
support this legislation because while
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
the issue of housing is a very important
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
one here in the state there's extra
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
hypers specificity when we're looking at
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
people who with disabilities looking for
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
housing and we need to make sure that we
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
are able to supply that housing for uh
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
everyone as we've heard already we
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
already have people who are living on
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
limited income and it is not always easy
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
to find a home even for people with
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
higher income uh who are
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
able-bodied uh and are trying to find
 
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:13.480 align:start position:0%
competitive uh rates for apartments uh
 
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
or other housing I think that this uh
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
study committee would be a good way
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
forward to look at how we can ensure
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the people of our state no matter
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
their ability level can guarantee that
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
they can find housing uh and with that
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
that's everything that I have I'm open
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
to any questions thank you thank you
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
representative representative yulla
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:23:37.279 --> 00:23:39.909 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
um I hear you and the previous speaker
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
talking about a affordability um however
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
I think that is cross the Spectrum not
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
just people with disabilities so I guess
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
from your
 
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.870 align:start position:0%
from your
perspective

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.590 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

00:23:58.590 --> 00:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the in the scope of what this
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
committee has heard before about you
 
00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
know if and and we're well aware of the
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
the affordability issues what do you
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
this this committee or or our committee
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
the special committee on housing um
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
could gather as far as the special need
 
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:26.240 align:start position:0%
of let's
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
say ramps or whatever uh you know uh
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
accessibility options in the housing
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
that are not being you know addressed I
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
guess by the overall trying to increase
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
the housing Supply and and decrease the
 
00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost in general what what do you see as
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
as the specific purpose or success of
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
this uh focus of the legislation yeah uh
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question uh I think
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
that in ter terms of how this committee
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
has uh been set up I mean we have all of
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
the bills that you guys have been
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
assigned to uh being heard today and
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
potentially being exec today and I mean
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
when I was leaving this morning uh I I
 
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
was having to deal with uh quite a bit
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
of snow on my road and uh I understand
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
that that can be potentially problematic
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities uh
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
especially if they were trying to come
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
to speak on this bill uh and I think
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
that if we set up a special committee
 
00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.190 align:start position:0%
that if we set up a special committee
that

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
can uh or a study committee that can
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
actually spend additional time going to
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
other communities in actually listening
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
to people with disabilities who may
 
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
struggle to come to conquer uh I think
 
00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
that that would be very valuable uh to
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
the types of legislation that we'd be
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
actually providing uh I mean again
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
that's an option for you know this
 
00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee as well uh but I think that in
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
terms of allowing uh for more
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities for people to come and
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
actually speak on some of this
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
legislation and share their stories uh
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually come to a better
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is it fair to
 
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
say that first of all and this is
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
hearkening back to a previous question
 
00:26:26.909 --> 00:26:26.919 align:start position:0%
that wasn't fully answered um by the
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
last person
 
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
um that the reason the affordability is
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
specifically important in this matter is
 
00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
because the the disabled Community is
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affected by it and
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
secondly the need for specialization on
 
00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
a study committee is important because
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
not all accommodations are as simple as
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
a ramp there are many different types of
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
accommodations that can't even be
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
retrofitted to a unit for example if you
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
need a unit to be spacious enough to
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate a large wheelchair units
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
just aren't built that way and because
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have that spe uh specificity or
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
specialization in that Committee in this
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee to understand those
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
differences and those nuances that might
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
be a reason to um both of those might be
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
a reason to need a a study commission or
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
committee yeah uh exactly I mean we have
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
people who are living on uh Social
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
Security Disability uh who are limited
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
to a few thousand a month uh and that's
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily enough to be able to uh
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
pay for rent pay for food pay for uh you
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
know uh any other bills that may end up
 
00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
coming up and we need to make sure that
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
we can be able to uh have options
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
available for people when not
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
necessarily all of the housing stock
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be looking to add
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
may actually be uh available for these
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities because as you
 
00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
said they may not necessarily be able to
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
be retroactively fitted with uh the
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
necessary accessibility components uh in
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
livable okay thank you representative
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much all right
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
Evans and I'll just remind everybody
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%

please send it to us and we will read it
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
but if you have something else say other
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
than what's written down that would be
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%

by individuals with disabilities would
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%

towards creating Equitable housing

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
challenges faced by our community in
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
accessing safe affordable and accessible
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
housing the findings of our task force
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
coupled with extensive research
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
highlight the urgent need for
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
comprehensive action to address the
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
housing crisis affecting people with
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities in New
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'll skip over some by
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
impact of the housing crisis on people
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
with disabilities House Bill 1168
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrates a commitment to
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
understanding the complex factors
 
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
contributing to housing inequities and
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
developing evidence-based solutions to
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
address them through data collection
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
state stakeholder engagement and
 
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
comprehensive analysis this committee
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
will lay groundwork for informed policy
 
00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:04.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations aimed at expanding
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
affordable and accessible housing
 
00:30:07.389 --> 00:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities for individuals with
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities across the state state in
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion we urge the committee to
 
00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
swiftly Advance House Bill 1168 and
 
00:30:15.789 --> 00:30:15.799 align:start position:0%
allocate the necessary resources to
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
support its implementation by
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
prioritizing the housing needs of people
 
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
with disabilities we can move closer to
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
realizing our shared vision of a more
 
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
just and inclusive Society where
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
everyone has the opportunity to thrive
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Damon thank you
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being here in
 
00:30:36.909 --> 00:30:36.919 align:start position:0%
the important work that you do actually
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
have two questions um you referenced
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Abel having a housing task force that's
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
already done some data collection is
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
there a report from that work or where
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
might that data be available to us we uh
 
00:30:52.669 --> 00:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
it's been uh mainly family members of
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities who have really
 
00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
the theme has been that adult PE adult
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
with disabilities have to be have been
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
living with their parents because they
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
have no other place that's um
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate for them but I can get you
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
some data from the task force I it would
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
be helpful to share with us whatever you
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
have already collected to inform us
 
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:15.389 align:start position:0%
have already collected to inform us
absolutely

00:31:15.389 --> 00:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
so well I'll ask the second question
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
maybe sort of already answered it I'm
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
wondering about what we know about the
 
00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:24.519 align:start position:0%
availability of com criet housing for
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled people I
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
actually used to work consult in that
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
population some quite a few years ago
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
now um and at the time I know there was
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
a wait list at all of the community
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
homes that I would visit does that
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
case I don't believe there is congregate
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
right there's no group homes that's what
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
I meant so they've gone away entirely
 
00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
yes when when we closed the sonuna
 
00:32:00.389 --> 00:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
center the no the um the institution
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
they also got gr went away with group
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
homes so that's the problem where people
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
have who want to live on their own but
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
also need support and also people who
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
need um to live with other people if
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
that's what they choose to also need
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
support that's what we're looking for
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%
thank you for your help
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
welome representative D Lorenzo uh thank
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
you for take my question um good one
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
would you believe that I managed group
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
homes um um in Boston and that the
 
00:32:33.629 --> 00:32:33.639 align:start position:0%
congregate housing was really really
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
successful at worked we've seen that
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's been successful in other states um
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
part of our housing task force we've
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
looked at other states and see that it's
 
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.350 align:start position:0%
looked at other states and see that it's
been

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
successful thank
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs and
 
00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.789 align:start position:0%
you representative Gibbs and
representative

00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
yell thank you Mr
 
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
chairman the uh I believe that the
 
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
section 811 housing that I mentioned
 
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.590 align:start position:0%
section 811 housing that I mentioned
earlier

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
can be congregate housing I don't know
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
whether there is any in New Hampshire um
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
but that is definitely something to
 
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
but that is definitely something to
consider

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely represent M Kell thank you
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um I'm
 
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
wondering uh I guess it's two parts if
 
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
you have been following this this uh
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
like last year this committee heard from
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of people um regarding in the
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
housing issues in the state and I'm
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if you um followed that and if
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
they they there was anyone that
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
you thought should be coming and and and
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
addressing the committee about the needs
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
um of the state that we didn't hear from
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you believe that this
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
this either this committee is unwilling
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
or un unable to be able to um tackle the
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
issue that that this one this bill could
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
have or any recommendations as far as um
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
people that this committee could invite
 
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
to speak as far as addressing this topic
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
I think there are a lot of people behind
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
me who are experts and would love to
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%

on developmental

disabilities I am providing testimony on
 
00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919 align:start position:0%
behalf of the DD council members who
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill would have a
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
positive impact on the disability
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
community at the heart of the ongoing
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
housing crisis there exists an untold
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
story about the unique challenges faced
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
by people with developmental
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities and their unmet need for
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
safe stable and affordable housing in
 
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.589 align:start position:0%
safe stable and affordable housing in
their

00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
communities having a stable home is the
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
foundation of everything that we build
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
our lives on lack of housing inevitably
 
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
escalates challenges that could other
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
wise be met through natural supports to
 
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
crisis situations that unravel
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
everything else in our lives the housing
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
crisis is a daily topic that is
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
adversely affecting our entire State and
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
is now putting our social and economic
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
stability in Jeopardy as we explore
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
Solutions the intellectual and
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
developmentally disabled are again left
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
conversation it is our hope that by
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
effects of the housing crisis on people
 
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
with disabilities we can address this
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
need in an effective way that puts our
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
state's most vulnerable people at the
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
Solutions while weighing this decision
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
to bring this legis legislation to vote
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
legislators and the public will hear a
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
lot about data and
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
statistics while these numbers are
 
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
important we hope that our legislators
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
take into consideration the stories that
 
00:36:28.829 --> 00:36:28.839 align:start position:0%
people want to share about how the lack
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
of suitable housing has been a barrier
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
to living a safe healthy inclusive life

of
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
meaning something that we all deserve
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
and something that disabled people
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
should not have to wait longer
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
for while these numbers are important
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to also remind you that people
 
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
are not looking for this committee to
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
come up with a silver bullet
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
solution what they're look looking for
 
00:37:00.309 --> 00:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
is to be able to inform the
 
00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
legislators on the needs of people with
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities and the barriers that they
 
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
are facing to housing in a historic

Damon thank you thanks for taking my
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
question could you just tell us a little
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
capsule about New Hampshire Council on
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities I'm not
 
00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
familiar with it is it a state agency or
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or thank you for your question
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
the DD Council
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
are in every state and territory we are
 
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
a ferally funded state agency we're
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
mandated out of the Developmental
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act and our charge is to
 
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
basically identify barriers to people
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
living with developmental disabilities
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
and helping to live inclusive lives in
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
the community and help the community
 
00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
also able to understand how they can
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
support people with
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.470 align:start position:0%
support people with
disabilities

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
yep thank you that's very helpful does
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
your agency collect data or have some
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
information you could share with us
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
about where there is housing in
 
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:43.240 align:start position:0%
communities throughout New Hampshire for
 
00:38:45.829 --> 00:38:45.839 align:start position:0%
this population and you know more
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
concretely what the need is so the
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
nhcd is part of a um triumverate that we
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
are all part of the Developmental
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act so our charge is for
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
advocacy and capacity building the UNH
 
00:39:08.589 --> 00:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
Institute on disability is our sister
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
agency and they do the research and
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
collect most of the data I I am happy to
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
provide data for you um in the future I
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
would like to say that that is one of
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we want to have a
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
special committee so that these agents
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
will be able to come and give that data
 
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:32.110 align:start position:0%
for you thank you very
 
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.710 align:start position:0%

your testimony thank you I have a gentle
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
reminder that people are saying they
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
still can't hear testifiers so if you
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
could please speak into the mic that
 
00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:55.400 align:start position:0%

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
oops good morning can everybody hear me
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
all right I'm generally pretty loud
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
without a microphone so um good morning
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Heather Stockwell and I'm
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
here to in support of HB
 
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.309 align:start position:0%
here to in support of HB

00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
1168
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
um an act establishing a committee to
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
study the impact of the housing crisis
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
on people with disabil ities and I'm I
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
work for rights and democracy as a
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
healthc care campaign organizer
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
um so I talk a lot about Healthcare
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
usually but I really see the
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
intersection of how this also impacts
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
our housing um
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
because people living on limited incomes
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
um are going to be struggling more and
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
more as we see prices
 
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
increase as we know New Hampshire has
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
had a housing shortage for some time now
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
and people would living with
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
disabilities already had long wait times
 
00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:01.400 align:start position:0%
for apartments and as we've discussed
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
the Section 8 voucher
 
00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.829 align:start position:0%
the Section 8 voucher
system

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:05.839 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
um it's it's very difficult for people
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
to find appropriate housing that is
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually affordable for their budgets
 
00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
and there are also I believe no
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
resources to help people find these
 
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
types of
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
Apartments um and from 20 to2 to 2022
 
00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire grew by almost 20,000
 
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.910 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire grew by almost 20,000
people

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
the census report uh states that we
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
increased our population by
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
years um and that has reduced the number
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
of available units overall in the market
 
00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:47.079 align:start position:0%
and during that time we also saw prices
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
soar not only for
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
housing but we've also seen record
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
inflation numbers on just regular
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
household items including groceries
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
the number of seniors in New Hampshire
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
also continues to increase it's
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
currently reported at about 20% of our
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
population is considered a senior
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
citizen seniors is a popular are a
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
population that are more likely to
 
00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
develop disabilities as they age and I'm
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
speaking from experience today because
 
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not a senior citizen yet but I am a
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
person that is experiencing Dynamic
 
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.230 align:start position:0%
person that is experiencing Dynamic
disabilities

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
and what that term means is that you
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
can't see my disabilities
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
probably but if you talk to me about it
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
or you caught me on a day that I'm tired
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
notice my Mobility isn't what it used to
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
be and I live in a very old home that I
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
already have struggled to afford and I I
 
00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:55.559 align:start position:0%
honestly don't personally see myself
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
having the money to convert that home so
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
that it is accessible for me so I'm
 
00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
therefore looking around at what's
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
available and it's very slim expensive
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it's not appropriate for my needs as
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
I as I age and I know I'm not alone here
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
which is why I'm speaking up I'm not
 
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:19.720 align:start position:0%
even 60 yet but I see that I am going to
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
need a better place to live I'm also
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
live in a rural
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
community in accessing some of the
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
services I might need as I age will also
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
become more of a struggle because I'll
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
have to drive maybe 20 30 minutes maybe
 
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
a full hour or more to find the things
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
need with that said many people living
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
with disabilities may also be living on
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
a fixed income as we've talked about
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
today and from my experience uh my
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
husband is disabled also
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little more visible for him but I
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
also understand if we were both on
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
disability we would not be able to
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
afford even where we live
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
currently and and frankly that's quite
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
affordable compared to today's
 
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:15.640 align:start position:0%
standards I also talked to a lot of
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
people that have these vouchers that
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
cannot find a place that is appropriate
 
00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:22.520 align:start position:0%
for them in the amount of time that they
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
need they are told over and over again
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
that aart ments do not take vouchers or
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
they have already rented all of the the
 
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
apartments that they can
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
um uh that they can use for vouchers so
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
even with those social security updates
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
those amounts are
 
00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
calculated on really out ofd cost of
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
living um scales and those vouchers
 
00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.109 align:start position:0%
living um scales and those vouchers
reflect

00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
that and I'm not saying that that's your
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
problem necessarily to figure out but I
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to take this on
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
because when we build and uh appropriate
 
00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:02.559 align:start position:0%
places for disabled people we're
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
building appropriate places for everyone
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a goal I think that
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see in our state if we want
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
people to stay living here thanks so
 
00:45:13.109 --> 00:45:13.119 align:start position:0%
much for your time happy to take
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has any thank you
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
miss stackwell any questions represent
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
yell thank you
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
um is there any um agencies or uh groups
 
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
that that you're aware of that this
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee has not already heard that you
 
00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
think that the this new committee or or
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
a listening session from from in this
 
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:39.400 align:start position:0%
committee that they should hear from on
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
this topic I think you're hearing from a
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
lot of them today I I'll add that I'm
 
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
also a participant in the class of 2024
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh the leadership series with uh the
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
institute on disability at UNH uh there
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
are several of us I think here today um
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
so that's one AEL New Hampshire has
 
00:45:58.109 --> 00:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
spoke today
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
um there are there are several different
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
um organizations that do work around
 
00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:07.559 align:start position:0%
this well I thank you I guess my
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
question is if the people are already
 
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.200 align:start position:0%
here why do you need another committee
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
to have them those same people come back
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
again I'm not sure I understand your
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
question I think we're here today
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
because a the committee doesn't exist at
 
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.589 align:start position:0%
because a the committee doesn't exist at
this

00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
time there this housing committee but a
 
00:46:29.549 --> 00:46:29.559 align:start position:0%
committee to study the impact on
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
disability housing does not exist at
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
this point not within the state house
 
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative D Lorenzo
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank for taking my
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
question so you know you talked about
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
elderly the elderly in their needs as
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
far as housing is concerned do you see
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
an intersection between the elderly
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
folks and then the disabled folks for
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
sure that's that is why I brought it up
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
in my testimony today um because I've um
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
I finally I guess realized even though I
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
have worked with disabled folks uh many
 
00:47:08.109 --> 00:47:08.119 align:start position:0%
times in my life uh that I'm coming to a
 
00:47:11.829 --> 00:47:11.839 align:start position:0%
new understanding that everybody as they
 
00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
age it is possible to develop a
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
disability as you age
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about all of ourselves
 
00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
maybe not right now but down the road so
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
there is an intersection there um I
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
think both those populations also uh are
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
on fixed or low incomes uh so need a
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
little extra
 
00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
help thank
 
00:47:40.829 --> 00:47:40.839 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you very
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thanks so much
 
00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
long and I miss miscalculated how long
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
this hearing would take so if you have
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
written testimony and you'd like to give
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
it to the committee we would definitely
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
read it but um we would appreciate
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
brevity in your remarks if you could
 
00:48:07.119 --> 00:48:24.630 align:start position:0%
brevity in your remarks if you could

housing committee sorry this is my first
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
time a little nervous no problem thank
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
you for your time and service my name is
 
00:48:42.589 --> 00:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
Tracy long I live in Alton I

wholeheartedly support HB 1168 and I'm
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
going to go off talk but real quick
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
because I keep hearing a similar
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
question from
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um there's a
 
00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.670 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um there's a
glare

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
glare
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
um and I'm probably not answering it
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
correctly but the reason why in my
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm a mother of a child with
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
special needs and when you hear the word
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
disability it really is a huge word it
 
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
means so many things whether it's
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
physical you're born with it you're
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
acquired this it's too big for I'm
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
assuming you have lots of topics you
 
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:24.799 align:start position:0%
deal with to me disabilities in itself
 
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
is so big it needs something unique and
 
00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:29.559 align:start position:0%
special cuz it's
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
complicated um so I'm here to speak on
 
00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
behalf of thousands of parents across
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
the state who feel exactly like me who
 
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:40.799 align:start position:0%
are fearful just like me not long after
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
my son Andrew was born it was clear he
 
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
had disabilities and due to these
 
00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities Andrew is reli Reliant upon
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
his parents and support to keep him sa
 
00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
safe make sure he is healthy and that he
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
has a roof over his head Andrew is 30
 
00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
now he has lived with his parents all
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
his life not because he wants to he
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
wishes to be like every other
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
30-year-old and have a home not with his
 
00:50:11.549 --> 00:50:11.559 align:start position:0%
parents it's through new fault of his
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
own that he cannot he works he
 
00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
entertains he volunteers and is a
 
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
well-rounded voting civic-minded
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
individual since Andrew was born my goal
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
my drive has been to help him become the
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
best Andrew he can be set the bar High
 
00:50:34.549 --> 00:50:34.559 align:start position:0%
work hard and more the more he learns
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
and becomes the more independent and
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
safe he would be or so I thought as he
 
00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
ages so do his father and I I was 27
 
00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
years old when I had Andrew and that's
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
when my mission
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
began um that's three years younger than
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
he is
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
today um I'm about to turn 50 9 his
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
father is 61 soon to retire he's a
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
teacher in the
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
state um it became clear as Andrew got
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
older no matter how hard he works or we
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
work he will never be able to live on
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
his own without
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
support um I will focus on him as an
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
individual and not go into the details
 
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the impact on the parents lives our
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
lives have become an extension of our
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
adult CH child children with special
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
needs and we are dutiful no matter how
 
00:51:32.349 --> 00:51:32.359 align:start position:0%
old we get or how difficult it is that's
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
another testimony in itself New
 
00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire severely lacks safe inclusive
 
00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
and appropriate places for those with
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities to live out
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
their lives with dignity and with
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
support what will happen to Andrew who's
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
behind me when we his parents can no
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
longer do for

my testimony

here in my capacity as a Disability
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
Policy professional I co-authored a
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
disability housing report in
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
2021 based on an informal survey of over
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
400 families across the state of New
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and individuals living with
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities it revealed that the severe
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
crisis in Workforce and affordable
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
housing has a disproportionate negative
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
impact to individuals with disabilities
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're here and in
 
00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:05.559 align:start position:0%
particular individuals as uh identified
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
as having an intellectual or
 
00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.549 align:start position:0%
as having an intellectual or
developmental

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
disability among the many issues
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
contributing to this problem currently
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
most adults with the label of
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
intellectual or developmental disability
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
live with their parents or other closed
 
00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:21.470 align:start position:0%
live with their parents or other closed
family

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:25.400 align:start position:0%
members parents are not obligated to
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
provide housing or any care to their
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
adult children there are currently over
 
00:54:35.069 --> 00:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
4,500 individuals in the state of New
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this means that there is a
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
small tidal wave of housing needs on the
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
doorstep of the New Hampshire
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
legislature we do not have institutions
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities and the
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
center for Medicaid Medicare
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
Services um prohibits the building of
 
00:54:56.309 --> 00:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
congregate housing if you want Medicaid
 
00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
funding New Hampshire's Department of
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services is disallowed
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
from letting Medicaid waiver funding be
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
used on
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
housing there is a serious structural
 
00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
flaw in the current system that's
 
00:55:15.069 --> 00:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
ignoring the lifespan threat of housing
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
instability and homelessness for
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
individuals living with intellectual and
 
00:55:19.359 --> 00:55:21.029 align:start position:0%
individuals living with intellectual and
developmental

00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
disabilities the system we currently
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
have in place is functionally not
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
sustainable and it is incumbent on the
 
00:55:28.589 --> 00:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to understand the
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
constellation of factors that are
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
contributing to this overwhelming
 
00:55:38.589 --> 00:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
problem parents carry the vast amount of
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility but it's in fact not
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
their job the disability housing study
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
committee can examine the statutory
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory funding and Workforce
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
components then establish a priority
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
list of actions that the New Hampshire
 
00:55:55.870 --> 00:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislature can take to play its role
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
because it can't be fixed by any one
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
entity in creating inclusive appropriate
 
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
accessible affordable housing people
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
with disabilities as others have said
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
want to be contributing taxpaying
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
citizens um this housing study committee
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
for the for the disability Community
 
00:56:19.390 --> 00:56:19.400 align:start position:0%
will help to create a road map for the
 
00:56:22.029 --> 00:56:22.039 align:start position:0%
homes they need to take their place I
 
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
will um I can be a resource for you on
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%

of supports and
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
services can and cannot uh help with
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
housing and how the different silos
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
either engage or or or not work together
 
00:56:46.589 --> 00:56:46.599 align:start position:0%

1168 in my written testimony I apologize
 
00:58:16.829 --> 00:58:16.839 align:start position:0%
I have transposed the last two digits of
 
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
the bill number I live in Hollis with my
 
00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
wife and 24-year-old son with autism I
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
was here uh prepared to get testimony on
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
my personal story I'm going to give a
 
00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
different story after hearing the
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
testimony today so far okay in
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
1990 I started a project to develop
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
software for people with hearing Visual
 
00:58:40.990 --> 00:58:41.000 align:start position:0%
and physical
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
impairments at that time everybody
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
thought well you know what do those
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
people do right they can't be employed
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
um and what does what does it mean to be
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
blind I can just close my eyes I can
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
plug my ears I can pretend I can't move
 
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
my hands or my arms and um I had to go
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
through working with people with dis
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities themselves to understand
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
the space better I had to develop a
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
story for why we could employ people
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
with develop sorry with um disabilities
 
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:11.000 align:start position:0%
and I was able to convince people with
 
00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%
the pur strings that it was a worthwhile
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
project to take on okay so where am I
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
right now with that we um we developed
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
an architecture that's in place today
 
00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
and it allows people with physical
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and visual impairments sorry
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
physical hearing and uh yeah visual
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
impairments to become employed be
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed have equal access to
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
software after hearing the testimony
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
today I would argue where we are with
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
housing for people disabilities is where
 
00:59:46.349 --> 00:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
I was back in 1990 I listened to the
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
housing committee testimony from last
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
June I heard somebody say or ask a
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
question what would we do about
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
accessibility and I think the response
 
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
was the Ada will just take care of that
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll think well just put a ramp
 
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
in okay and I hear testimony today it's
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
very similar and it's not that it's
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
insulting it's just because you don't
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
understand the problem and the
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee will help you understand
 
01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:14.119 align:start position:0%
that problem and with the subcommittee I
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
would say you need to talk to the
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
developmental Services quality Council
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
to find an RSA 171a 33 you need to talk
 
01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
to the institute on disabilities you
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
need to talk to um the governor's
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
Commission on disabilities the New
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Council on developmental
 
01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities the Brain Injury
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
Association um and so on okay so you
 
01:00:35.309 --> 01:00:35.319 align:start position:0%
need to talk with the subject matter
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
experts you also need to learn from the
 
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:39.640 align:start position:0%
failures of the lonia state school and
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
why congregate settings aren't always a
 
01:00:45.069 --> 01:00:45.079 align:start position:0%
great solution why they can be an
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
absolute disaster okay so my thing here
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
is I Chang my testimony from a personal
 
01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:53.559 align:start position:0%
testimony to say why is this
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee necessary NE why it is
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
important why do we want to make a very
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
special Focus thing to learn about this
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
problem and because of that I ask you to
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 11
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
68 thank you very much Mr Walker any
 
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chairman um my
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
question is isn't the problem with
 
01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
congregate housing uh basically when
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities are denied a
 
01:01:23.470 --> 01:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
choice that is they don't have a choice
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
about whether to go into congregate
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
housing or another type of perhaps more
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
independent living type of housing uh
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
rather than uh the problem being the
 
01:01:37.029 --> 01:01:37.039 align:start position:0%
existence of congregate housing well
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
it's a very long conversation to have
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
about uh issues with congregate housing
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's a very very good video on
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
YouTube that talks about the L lonia
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
state school and how it started off with
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
possibly great intentions and ended up
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
with a disaster in inhumane
 
01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:55.559 align:start position:0%
environment all
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh but isn't congregate
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
housing uh such as it may exist today
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
quite different from the lonia state
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
school yeah I I I'm not an expert so I
 
01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:11.079 align:start position:0%
got the speaker in front of me I'm not
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
an expert uh in in the laws but I
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
believe there are laws in place that
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
will prevent the overall size of of
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
congrega housing uh yes I I am familiar
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
with that um so that it's not not uh
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
there are laws in place that prevent the
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
development of
 
01:02:34.430 --> 01:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
Institutions uh but rather that provide
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh essentially
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
choice so was that a question um sorry
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
it was a comment okay all right thank
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%

years old and she has Down syndrome I am

because it is a similar story to so many
 
01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.150 align:start position:0%
because it is a similar story to so many
other

01:03:45.150 --> 01:03:45.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.670 align:start position:0%
other
people

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
um did I say Sam has Down syndrome she
 
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
is ready to move out of her childhood
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
home uh and live in her own apartment
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
but she needs support every single day
 
01:04:01.589 --> 01:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
um so that she can get out into the
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
community and um do the things she loves
 
01:04:08.750 --> 01:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
to do the reality is that her dad and I
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
are not always going to be around to
 
01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
take care of her drive her everywhere
 
01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
and meet all of her
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
needs I'm here to speak for Sam and her
 
01:04:21.309 --> 01:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
situation as well as others who are so
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
very scared and concerned about what's
 
01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
going to happen happen to their children
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
when they can no longer take care of
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
them both my husband and I will be 63
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
this year though I would like to believe
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
that I'm still young I do live with two
 
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
unseen medical conditions that could
 
01:04:42.150 --> 01:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
leave me
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
incapacitated at any time unable to
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
provide Sam with my time my attention or
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
ability to get her out in the community
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
so she could live her life and she
 
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:57.880 align:start position:0%
depends upon us to do
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
that um without our assistance she would
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
live a very isolated life which is
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
detrimental to
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
anybody if she were to live in supported
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
housing and I'm talking about supported
 
01:05:17.069 --> 01:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
housing in an apartment that is a group
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
of Apartments together that are
 
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
supported 24 hours she would continue to
 
01:05:24.789 --> 01:05:24.799 align:start position:0%
have access to the community
 
01:05:28.029 --> 01:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
her job she works 13 hours a week her
 
01:05:28.039 --> 01:05:30.069 align:start position:0%
her job she works 13 hours a week her
volunteer

01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
work her recreational activities and her
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
friends long after we can no longer take
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
her to these places she thrives on her
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
time in the community and the community
 
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:46.039 align:start position:0%
Embraces her
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
presence since 2019 I have been on the
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
board of a nonprofit working towards
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
creating housings housing for ID
 
01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.630 align:start position:0%
creating housings housing for ID
individual

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:05:58.470 --> 01:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
idual it has been a long hard journey to
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
fulfill its Mission there are so many
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
barriers including zoning regulations
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
licensing rules and raising the funds to
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
carry the job to completion we need to
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
create safe supported housing for
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
individuals with ID aged 18 to
 
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
64 policies need to be reviewed and
 
01:06:20.589 --> 01:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
created that best meet the needs of
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
these individuals as soon as possible
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're talking about housing choice at
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
this time there is no housing choice for
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
ID they need 24-hour support they need
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
support to get out in the community and
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
they need they need
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
Transportation please I urge you to vote
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
Yes to form this committee who can can
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
explore these options and to see what
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
the need is parents are aging and will
 
01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:55.880 align:start position:0%
not be able to take care of their
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
children in indefinitely our children
 
01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
desire to live independent and live
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
amongst their friends in their own
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
Apartments they want a place to call
 
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
their own just like their siblings
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
their their non-disabled siblings and
 
01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
peers there are many families in crisis
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
situations right now and many more will
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
be as the years tick by the committee
 
01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
can only be a win to help find the
 
01:07:25.150 --> 01:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
solutions to long-term inclusive and
 
01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
safe Housing

testifying in support of is House Bill
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
1168 Bill 1168 is a first step in
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
gathering current numbers of how many
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
individuals like my son Micah are at
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
risk of homelessness if something
 
01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
happens to their family member caretaker
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here today representing a parent
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
group that most people would not want to
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
join parents who hope we live longer
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
than our children because we fear for
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
their care when when we are no longer
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
alive I am part of a parent group
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
connected to the mo Center who have been
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
exploring housing options here and in
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
other states with the goal of creating
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
viable options for this highly
 
01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
viable options for this highly
vulnerable

01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
population having solid numbers for the
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
upcoming need in New Hampshire as well
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
as a plan for New Hampshire to move
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
forward is crucial for the future of our
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
children my 30-year-old son Micah has
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
level three autism also known as severe
 
01:09:23.239 --> 01:09:24.590 align:start position:0%
level three autism also known as severe
autism

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
autism
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
falls under the diagnosis of
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
intellectual developmental disabilities
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
or ID in Micah's case his diagnosis
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
means he's non-verbal and needs
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
one-on-one care every waking moment I'm
 
01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
blessed that my son is a gentle guy but
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
his impulsive actions such as bolting
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
away from caretakers and Pica eating in
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
editable objects often places him and
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes other people's at risk Micah's
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
father died when he was aged 14 and I
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
his only surviving parent he has
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
siblings who will be there for him in
 
01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
the long run but my hope is that they
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
can fulfill the important sibling role
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
with Micah settled into a residence
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
where he can age in place before I am
 
01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
too old to care for him Micah currently
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
lives at home and has a day program
 
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
through the moris center there are many
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
families like mine doing their best to
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
care for their adult children at home
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
because supporting housing options are
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
not available New Hampshire has a few
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
group homes and programs for adults with
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
ided including enhan enhanced family
 
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
care which is like an adult foster care
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
program these housing options only meet
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of some individuals and are
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
not for long-term Solutions because when
 
01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:42.199 align:start position:0%
the foster parents decide to end their
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
caring role the adults with ID have to
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
move to another home change is
 
01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:49.719 align:start position:0%
especially difficult for individuals
 
01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
with ID even minor changes like wearing
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
a new shirt can be be met with meltdowns
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
confusion and self-injurious behaviors
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
long-term stable housing is a critical
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
need for mic his peers and for families
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
who just want to sustain their quality
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
of life in New Hampshire I'm asking that
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
you please support this bill and support
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
our efforts to provide for our children
 
01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
01:11:17.149 --> 01:11:17.159 align:start position:0%
consideration of this critical need
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Patel any questions
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
representative D Lorenzo hi thank you Mr
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
question I was really interested in
 
01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
hearing more about the enhanced Family
 
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
Care Program could you tell me about
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
that please um it is a program provided
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
through the state for some individuals
 
01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
where um it's it's like foster care
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
people become foster care parents for
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
adults and so um Micah could potentially
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
move in with another family but as I
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
said it tends to be shortterm 3 to 5
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
years they decide to um end their
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
fostering and then the child the adult
 
01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
has to move out which is not a solution
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
for children with extensive adults with
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
extensive needs like my son followup
 
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
please follow okay so um these fosta
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
families um do they have any
 
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
special education for the are they
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
trained in any way do they have do they
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
have a background not my area of
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
expertise but I would assume they are
 
01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
trained they're paid um to provide the
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
service so they have some training um
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
again it's a short-term option for some
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
clients that that seems to work but very
 
01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
few I mean there's literally hundreds of
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
families with their child living at home
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
like mine because there aren't enough
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
options for them thank
 
01:12:41.910 --> 01:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
you right thank you very much for your
 
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
testimony next I'll call on
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
lontine I apologize I didn't see the
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
pink card ahead of time but welcome to
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
the special
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.790 align:start position:0%
the special
committee

01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Jessica lontine representative
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
from do straford
 
01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
17 and I'm here to speak in favor of HB
 
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
1168 and I want to tell a story um about
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
one woman in particular who is my
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter Eliza who has Down
 
01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:16.830 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter Eliza who has Down
syndrome

01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
and both Eliza's parents um realized at
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
some point that they they would also
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um Eliza would most likely survive them
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
when they were worried about her future
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
where would she be and also with their
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
own experience they saw what happened
 
01:13:40.510 --> 01:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
with um you know other adults with
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities who suddenly found um when
 
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
they lost their parent one of their
 
01:13:48.830 --> 01:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
parents it was a shock that trauma in
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
itself but for that adult with a
 
01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
disability to have never never lived on
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
their own away from their parents and
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
they wanted to prepare a liers for
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
that so when she was at 25 years old in
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
2010 um Eliza started in a home care
 
01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.590 align:start position:0%
2010 um Eliza started in a home care
providership

01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
providership
 
01:14:10.510 --> 01:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
program and that's an arrangement in
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
which a nonprofit agency pays a
 
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
individual to provide room and board and
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
a limited number of
 
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:21.629 align:start position:0%
a limited number of
services

01:14:21.629 --> 01:14:21.639 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
and that worked um the Eliza's first one
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
worked out really well it was a young
 
01:14:29.790 --> 01:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
woman who then rented a two-bedroom
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
apartment for Eliza to live with her and
 
01:14:35.110 --> 01:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
Eliza adapted very well to that
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
situation and then that woman you know
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
she wanted to move on with her life and
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
um get married and so Eliza moved back
 
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
with us the agency then it took them a
 
01:14:50.709 --> 01:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
couple months they found another one
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
that lasted about 6 months so so this
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
went on for a couple years where Eliza
 
01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
was moving out and then back in which
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
had its own um challenges emotionally
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
for Eliza then they found one woman who
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
was the home care provider and that one
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
lasted for six
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
years and the big difference was is this
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
was an older woman who owned her own
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
home she was an empty
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
nester and she you know she had her own
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
goals of double paying her mortgage and
 
01:15:26.629 --> 01:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
you know that one worked out well but
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
that brings us to like 2019 and the
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
light of move back with us in the agency
 
01:15:34.270 --> 01:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
then had to find another home care
 
01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
provider but at this point the housing
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
market in Dober was kind of out of
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
control they could find a home care
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
provider who then had to rent a place
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they could not find an affordable
 
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
place to live in
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
Dover um so for about a year Eliza lived
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
with us while they're trying to find
 
01:15:58.830 --> 01:15:58.840 align:start position:0%
someone and my husband thought you know
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
but really we should find a permanent
 
01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
place for Eliza to
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
live um and then it's the home care
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
provider that moves in and
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
out and we did that and but we realized
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
how lucky they are that first we found a
 
01:16:17.470 --> 01:16:17.480 align:start position:0%
place that needed a lot of work and my
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
husband and I are contractors so we
 
01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
could do the work so we created this
 
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
situ ation where the home care provider
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
lived um in the house and we created a
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
semi independent apartment for Eliza and
 
01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
then her boyfriend who also has Down
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
syndrome so they could live together but
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was really a lesson for us of how
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
much we saw the housing market impact
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
the agency's ability to find um suitable
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
housing for the home care providers to
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
live in um
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
and it also was really a lesson in you
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
know how much the stability of of our
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
secure um a permanent place as opposed
 
01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be dependent on the housing rental
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
market in order for this whole
 
01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
arrangement to
 
01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:14.990 align:start position:0%
arrangement to
work

01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I say one other thing
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
really learn to appreciate what
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
Supportive Housing
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
means and Eliz is always going to need
 
01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.350 align:start position:0%
means and Eliz is always going to need
Supportive

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
Supportive
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
Housing and in some ways because she has
 
01:17:37.750 --> 01:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
such a defined disability you know she
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
has Down syndrome that she's El eligible
 
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
for these funds to help pay for this
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
housing she also has all her health care
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
needs taken care of and I see so many
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
people that have less um clear clearly
 
01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.070 align:start position:0%
people that have less um clear clearly
defined

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
defined
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are just a little
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
higher functioning than Eliza and they
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
get no help at all but I think in our
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
society we need a lot more Supportive
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
Housing across the
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
spectrum of disability in the future
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my story yes thank you very
 
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
much representative for your testimony
 
01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.550 align:start position:0%
much representative for your testimony
representative

01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative I
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
have a kind of um
 
01:18:27.790 --> 01:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
philosophical uh would you believe
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
question and I apologize for throwing it
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
at you in spite of your personal um
 
01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
story um but you you hit on it the topic
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of your testimony which is
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
how do we take care of each other in
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
society would you believe that the first
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
um artifact that archaeologists point to
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
as the first sign of human civilization
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
is not a particular tool or a form of
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
currency or anything like that but a
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
femur that had been broken and healed
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
because without human civilization
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
taking care of each other that person
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
who had the broken femur would have died
 
01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:07.719 align:start position:0%
and the bone would have never healed so
 
01:19:10.189 --> 01:19:10.199 align:start position:0%
that is the singular beginning according
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
to archaeologist beginning of human
 
01:19:15.189 --> 01:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
civilization would you believe that yes
 
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
don't believe it was considered a
 
01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
neanderthal not a homo sapian you may be
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you very much for that
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%

I'm my name is Lori McIntosh I'm a
 
01:21:04.510 --> 01:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
resident of Dover and I'm a parent of
 
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
two adult children with intellectual
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and yeah I'll
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
shorten this up a little bit I feel a
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
huge pressure to get my boys into some
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
place where they can survive when I'm
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
gone um I'm working with a bunch of
 
01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
parents um on a nonprofit to build in
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
for adults with developmental
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
disabilities we have 60 families on our
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
waiting list there are over 100 people
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
on the other waiting list for the two
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
other places in the state that are
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
similar to this um people with ID need
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
support to be successful and we need
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
solutions that are cost effective for
 
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
instance when people share overnight
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
staff they're all paying for that
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
overnight staff person so some form of
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm not going to say congregate care
 
01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:51.400 align:start position:0%
but putting people in apartments with
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
the apartments are near each each other
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
can be a very beneficial thing because
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
you can have some sharing of Staff um in
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
the five years since we began working on
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
our projects the rules and regulations
 
01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
have toughened and tightened to make it
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
even tougher to build housing for
 
01:22:09.550 --> 01:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
developmental dis people with
 
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.709 align:start position:0%
developmental dis people with
developmental

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
developmental
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
disabilities our place is planning one
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
kind of home that is nine units of
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
housing they're all independent
 
01:22:18.430 --> 01:22:18.440 align:start position:0%
Apartments everybody has their own place
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
they have their own choice they have
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
their own lives they have
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
transportation that's coming along um
 
01:22:27.070 --> 01:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
and then we're also working with a
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
developer from out of state who builds
 
01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 units of affordable housing and
 
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
25% of those apartments are designated
 
01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.189 align:start position:0%
25% of those apartments are designated
for

01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
ID and he's been very successful in
 
01:22:42.430 --> 01:22:42.440 align:start position:0%
other states building these projects and
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
it's a very beautiful inclusive model
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
for these tenants who live with other
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
people um in the same
 
01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:54.280 align:start position:0%
building they have 247 sta Etc so the
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
licensing rules in New
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we started this project
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
we were required to be
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
certified and now we're required to be
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
licensed like a medical
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
facility so we're having to really
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
upgrade the way we're building the
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
paperwork requirements for lure cause 40
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
new different types of documentation so
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
you have to hire more staff to be
 
01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.189 align:start position:0%
you have to hire more staff to be
licensed

01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
so the whole lure and certification
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
issue needs to be looked at carefully
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
because it's really a barrier for places
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
like us that are trying to build housing
 
01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
um anyway zoning is another issue we are
 
01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:40.719 align:start position:0%
in an AR looking at a property in an R20
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
Zone in Dover and R20 is zone for
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
congregate care and assisted living for
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
people over
 
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
65 the state recognized the need for
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
housing for seniors years ago and it's
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
part of many of their zoning
 
01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.629 align:start position:0%
part of many of their zoning
requirements

01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
however not for the population that
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
we're presenting you today so if we
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
could make Statewide changes in zoning
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
that would allow you know Assisted
 
01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
Living kind of care for people with not
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
being in institutions being separate
 
01:24:14.430 --> 01:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
Apartments everyone has Choice all the
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
things to not make it institutional but
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
would be a lot more cost effective um
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
the licensing requires things like if
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have an Ator it has to be big enough
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
to hold a gurnie we don't need that if
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
you have toilets have to support an 800
 
01:24:32.790 --> 01:24:32.800 align:start position:0%
PB person those are the lure
 
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
requirements and we don't need that in
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
just apartments for people with ID so
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
hopefully the study committee will pave
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
the way for the necessary changes in the
 
01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations for this type of
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
housing so that it will be safe and
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
well-run but not ridiculously expensive
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much for your
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Gibbs
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
thank you uh and thank you for your
 
01:24:59.030 --> 01:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony hi over
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
there um The Lure requirements that you
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
described where do they come from are
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
they state or federal what agency uh
 
01:25:12.149 --> 01:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS and and and yeah DHHS and they're
 
01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
following some of DHHS right and
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
there're they're following some of the
 
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
federal rules like the federal rules say
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
that you can't have more than three
 
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
people per unit and that was to avoid
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
institutional situations and when we
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
started we were just paying attention to
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
that now they're sort of going by a no
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
more than three people Under One Roof
 
01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
which makes a big difference because it
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
makes if you have you know five
 
01:25:38.590 --> 01:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
apartments in a building now you have to
 
01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.709 align:start position:0%
apartments in a building now you have to
be

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
licensed I'm glad you I'm glad you said
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
something about that is that is that
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
rule making that this is happening or is
 
01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:49.830 align:start position:0%
rule making that this is happening or is
this

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
statue I can't if somebody if somebody
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
can send an email to the committee I'd
 
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
love to know specifically if these are
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
DHS HHS rules or if they're yeah I think
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
it's an interpretation of the of the
 
01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
statute okay got it represent Kell yeah
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I I definitely kind of on that
 
01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
same line would love for for either you
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
to come back and testify to this
 
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
committee specifically on that subject
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
or have you just follow up with your the
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
whatever you're being subject to whether
 
01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
that be a specific law or RSA or um uh
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
DHHS the contact person or whatever so
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we can grab more information on
 
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
that subject because I think that like a
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or or um as far as that
 
01:26:39.310 --> 01:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
just being kind of diving into that may
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
be of value to this committee so thank
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%

an apartment with ongoing assistance
 
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
from both sets of parents to make this

is he will be homeless and medically
 
01:28:45.470 --> 01:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
compromised if there's no supported

01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
care system called enhanced family care
 
01:29:30.910 --> 01:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
which is unstable the average placement
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
being just 3 to 5 years can you imagine
 
01:29:36.109 --> 01:29:36.119 align:start position:0%
being uprooted every few years to places
 
01:29:38.310 --> 01:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
you don't know uh to be P put with
 
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
people you've never met for the rest of

age in place without the fear of being

rehomed again in again the only other
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
option the state of New Hampshire would
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
provide for him is a nursing home
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
placement which is so appropriate for
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
someone only 42 years old and as we all
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
know there aren't even enough nursing
 
01:29:58.629 --> 01:29:58.639 align:start position:0%
homes available for senior citizens that
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
need it I'm an active member of parent
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups that are in desperation
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
to find solutions to this problem and
 
01:30:07.350 --> 01:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
the clock is ticking parents are working
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
with local and federal agencies begging
 
01:30:11.470 --> 01:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
for private donations and grants and
 
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
trying to identify interested developers
 
01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
in order to build supportive and
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
permanent housing for their aging child
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
places like the home possible project
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
farmsteads our place and Visions are
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
examples of parent organized projects
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
tackling this challenge this issue is
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
not unique to our state surrounding
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
states throughout New England have
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
already implemented solutions that
 
01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
address the same housing dilemma so why
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%

quite some time what is going to happen

no longer take care of
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%

01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
know I'll be safe and happy in my own
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%

positive even if I was lucky enough to
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
get in I would feel sad for the others
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%

what housing situation you would look
 
01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
what would that look like to you what
 
01:34:30.669 --> 01:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
would be good I I just would not like to

okay and
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
safe go ahead kind of followup um so do
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
you envision that kind of looking like a
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
a a single family home or something more
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
like an apartment complex or um just a
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
room in a kind of like a shared living
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
space where uh you know like a common
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
area what what types of can you get a a
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific on that I
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
envision like a like an area that has
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
Apartments like our place that has a
 
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
shared area as well so that people can
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
go to their apartment and then when they
 
01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:35.239 align:start position:0%
want to get together with their friends
 
01:35:37.950 --> 01:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
or have dinner like have a game night or
 
01:35:41.550 --> 01:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
something they can go to the common area
 
01:35:44.189 --> 01:35:44.199 align:start position:0%
and hang out and hang out with other
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
tenants sure okay so mean like the
 
01:35:50.430 --> 01:35:50.440 align:start position:0%

01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
testified um I'm 76 and I have a
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
30-year-old daughter and we have the
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
great fear that where will she go when
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
she leaves our house I'm I'm trying not
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be emotional but the last speaker got
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
time

01:37:22.470 --> 01:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm speaking really for ELA
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
Esley and if you asked her where she
 
01:37:33.109 --> 01:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to live I realized I need to
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of congr G housing I
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
didn't know what it meant I do know when
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
we moved to New Hampshire for my wife
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
got a job teaching at the University of
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire shortly after we
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
arrived PE specialist started meeting
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
with us and asking this question why did
 
01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
you move to New Hampshire this is not
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
the state for a family with a disabled
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
child I've been told that at least 30
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
times by people like people back here
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
and here's the problem when we first
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
arrived I would continually hear from
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
people sitting behind desks with ties on
 
01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:22.149 align:start position:0%
people sitting behind desks with ties on
and

01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
that oh we've closed the big
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
institutions we had a terrible problem
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
with congregate housing and but we've
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
closed them all now so the problem
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
solved the thing is they closed them all
 
01:38:41.830 --> 01:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
with no alternative I knew that 25 years
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
ago I'm sorry the state I have heard a
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative within a
 
01:38:51.229 --> 01:38:51.239 align:start position:0%
year tell me how we solve that problem
 
01:38:54.109 --> 01:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
and they were so proud for New Hampshire
 
01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to tell you that there's a
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
Title Wave coming of expenses to the
 
01:39:03.669 --> 01:39:03.679 align:start position:0%
state because if you have to take care
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
of my daughter the budget for my
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
daughter increase would increase to
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
about $100,000 a year if all of the
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
parents like me who are desperately
 
01:39:18.910 --> 01:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
trying to find solutions for our child
 
01:39:21.790 --> 01:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
immediately said we we're done you're
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
not helping there is no solution the
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
state would go
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
broke and you probably be accused of
 
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid fraud because the area agencies
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
pretend they have Solutions they're
 
01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be our Advocates but they
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
don't have Solutions so let me give you
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
an example if you ask my daughter where
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
she wanted to be she would say I want to
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
be in a house where I have friends and
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
we can cook meals together she wants a
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
coate house and here's the strange thing
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
other states have them I grew up in
 
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
Rochester New York and my cousin says
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
why didn't you move to Rochester we have
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of these units available now
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
there's waiting lists in New York state
 
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
too but things actually exist so the
 
01:40:16.510 --> 01:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
meaningful one of the questions that
 
01:40:22.070 --> 01:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
people would ask me the special ists who
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
would say why did you move here is
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
essentially their question was why are
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
you so clueless about what your
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
daughter's going to need this state
 
01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't do
 
01:40:36.550 --> 01:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
it I'm so tired
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
of it makes me Furious the question of
 
01:40:43.589 --> 01:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
why this committee is needed
 
01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
why I've known this problem for 25 years
 
01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
and been terrified and we can't move we
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
can't afford to move
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
and now we're stuck here and I don't see
 
01:40:59.430 --> 01:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
anyone taking meaningful action at the
 
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
state level in fact the congregate the
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
fear of congregate housing is severely
 
01:41:08.750 --> 01:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
that three h people it's crazy other
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
states have found solutions to this and
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
they exist and anyone can drive to look
 
01:41:16.990 --> 01:41:17.000 align:start position:0%
at them we've done it final how how much
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
time do I have left as much as you need
 
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:22.229 align:start position:0%
time do I have left as much as you need
okay

01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:41:26.589 --> 01:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
four years ago oh by the way one of the
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
people speaking here told me I'm 76 and
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
on my 75 I'm sorry on my 75th birthday
 
01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:33.990 align:start position:0%
on my 75 I'm sorry on my 75th birthday
at

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:43.400 align:start position:0%
in with my daughter sitting there the
 
01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
doctor came in the
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
emergency and said we've got the good
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
news and bad news is the good news news
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
is we know what happened to you the bad
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
news is you've had a Transit a TIA a
 
01:41:58.159 --> 01:42:02.070 align:start position:0%
news is you've had a Transit a TIA a
mini

01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
stroke I live on a Razor's Edge now and
 
01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
my wife suffers from severe depression
 
01:42:11.709 --> 01:42:11.719 align:start position:0%
so sometimes she can help and sometimes
 
01:42:16.149 --> 01:42:16.159 align:start position:0%
she can't and I'm looking at a crisis
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
that you can't imagine it till you're in
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
it that's the problem you need to let
 
01:42:25.709 --> 01:42:25.719 align:start position:0%
these people speak so you can help solve
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
the problem New Hampshire is one of the
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
most backward States in this area
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
because they they got their hand burned
 
01:42:36.109 --> 01:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
on the stove of congregate housing and
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
said well never again here that's crazy
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
congregate housing is far cheaper far
 
01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
congregate housing is far cheaper far
more

01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:42:48.430 --> 01:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
inclusive and easier to implement than
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
the solution the state has with that 3 5
 
01:42:53.589 --> 01:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
year nonsense
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
finally when we put our area agency
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
these are the agencies that we have to
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
work with with our child on the spot and
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
said we want you to start looking right
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
now for a place for our daughter live
 
01:43:09.189 --> 01:43:09.199 align:start position:0%
and here's her only requirements she
 
01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
wants to have friends and she wants to
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
be safe and do you know what they came
 
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
up with oh and in and she wants to stay
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
in the area she lives in because that's
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
where she knows people she has a job she
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
works at at a grocery store has for nine
 
01:43:28.390 --> 01:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
years the grocery store does a better
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
job than in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
on being inclusive and when they called
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
and said we found a solution to you they
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
found a group home with three
 
01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
people one of them was had to violent
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
and had to be
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
restrained nonverbal and the other was
 
01:43:54.510 --> 01:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
severely impaired needed continual care
 
01:43:57.070 --> 01:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
nonverbal that was the community they
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
were suggesting we send her to if you
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
lived with this problem you wouldn't be
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
asking why this is needed I'm sorry
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's thank you very much for your
 
01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:09.400 align:start position:0%

out there in New Hampshire right now um
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly not to say that it covers all
 
01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
the bases um there's certainly a lot of
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
Need for different options for people um
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
but right now there's enhanced family
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
care which you've heard uh is adult
 
01:45:29.229 --> 01:45:29.239 align:start position:0%
foster care um that can be up to three
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
individuals living in a home in a foster
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
care uh setting with a family could be a
 
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
couple could be a family with children
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
could be a single person they're they're
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
all different there are thousands of
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
situations like that out in the state of
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now um I don't have
 
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:47.560 align:start position:0%
actual numbers for you but I would
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
venture to say that a significant
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
portion of people who receive
 
01:45:53.550 --> 01:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
residential services are in that setting
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the state um we also have the option
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
of which smaller in number uh staffed
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
residences um I keep hearing the term
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
congregate housing thrown around there
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
um we really just have uh staffed
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
residences here in New Hampshire uh I
 
01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
heard somebody mention that there is um
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
some numbers uh so right now we can have
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
staffed residences in What's called the
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
certified setting for up to three
 
01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:28.719 align:start position:0%
individuals uh anything for and above in
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
one uh individual address has to be a
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
licensed program and that is the same
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
licensing department that licenses
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
places like hospitals uh so there's a
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
different set of rules uh that govern
 
01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:47.360 align:start position:0%
lure for settings or four or more
 
01:46:50.589 --> 01:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
individuals um those are laws that are
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
in place in the state we do have
 
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
regulations that govern each of those uh
 
01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:56.440 align:start position:0%
the functioning of each of those
 
01:46:59.070 --> 01:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
programs everything from training
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
requirements to you know fire and and
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
security settings um you know all all
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
kinds of requirements for those each of
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
them have their own set of
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
regulations um we also have uh people
 
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
living in family you know you've heard
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
from many families who are desperate for
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
really the the options that their family
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
member needs um and it ranges everything
 
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
is individual arise just like we are as
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
people um everybody wants a different
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
thing when they get older and and it's
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
really based on what their family needs
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
are what their individual needs are they
 
01:47:38.629 --> 01:47:38.639 align:start position:0%
want roommates or not do they want to
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
live in an in-law type setting you know
 
01:47:45.990 --> 01:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
it it it runs the gamut um so what we
 
01:47:48.990 --> 01:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
are supporting this bill uh
 
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
because they're needs to be the options
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
out there for people um for housing they
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
they need the options to be able to
 
01:47:59.709 --> 01:47:59.719 align:start position:0%
choose what they want with their life um
 
01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
people work really really hard to have
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
their their adult children and and give
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
them the options that people without
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities have and often times uh
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
housing barriers are are kind of slowing
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
people down so um I just wanted to offer
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a little bit more information as
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
far as what the barriers are that that
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
could be out there um and I think that
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
having somebody having a committee dive
 
01:48:31.470 --> 01:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
into this uh will be really really
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
helpful going forward so any questions
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:48:39.070 --> 01:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you and thank
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
you for being here to speak to us uh do
 
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know why uh a uh facility um and I'm
 
01:48:50.750 --> 01:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to use the term group housing but
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
just group in a generic term as you
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
might say um that has four or more
 
01:49:00.149 --> 01:49:00.159 align:start position:0%
residents has to be licensed um as a
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
medical facility uh is that a statute
 
01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
you know or a regulation and if it's a
 
01:49:09.390 --> 01:49:09.400 align:start position:0%
regulation do you know what the
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
rationale for it is so I can't tell you
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
the background it is both a statute uh
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
and a regulation um for people who are
 
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:20.709 align:start position:0%
and a regulation um for people who are
in

01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:49:22.589 --> 01:49:22.599 align:start position:0%
uh receiving services on the Home and
 
01:49:26.030 --> 01:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
Community Based care waiver uh those
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
residences of four or more people have
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be both certified and licensed um so
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
they have to kind of meet a second
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
standard um which is the The Lure
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
criteria um so there are additional
 
01:49:44.750 --> 01:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
layers of um things so things such as
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
having a sprinkled you know having
 
01:49:50.589 --> 01:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems and um just different
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh requirements over and above what's
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
required for
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
certification follow up thank you uh
 
01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
um what I was asking about um uh most
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
importantly though um was not things
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
like sprinkler systems which are
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
required in all kinds of um multi-unit
 
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
housing uh but rather um things like uh
 
01:50:21.149 --> 01:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
as was mentioned earlier a requirement
 
01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
that an elevator has to be large enough
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
for a gurnie uh which obviously is
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
necessary in a hospital but it's not
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
necessary um for a uh some for some kind
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
of group housing where people are living
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
uh independently but with support and
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
want to be able to gather in a group as
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
also has been mentioned earlier uh why
 
01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
does it need to go to that point where
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
you need an elevator that could take a
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
gurnie do you know yeah so it's not uh
 
01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
the The Lure requirements is the same
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
Department that licenses places like
 
01:51:01.270 --> 01:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals it's not the actual
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
same there are lure requirements
 
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
specific to residential housing um for
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who receive waiver services
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
so it's not they're they're not having
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
to literally like almost build a
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
hospital around individuals um it's just
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
the same Department that that oversees
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
this is that something we need to look
 
01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:28.790 align:start position:0%
this is that something we need to look
further

01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
into yeah so that's Thank you Lisa so um
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
I something else that you might be
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
wondering about is there are also uh a
 
01:51:41.589 --> 01:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
lot of changes that are happening and
 
01:51:44.350 --> 01:51:44.360 align:start position:0%
coming down from CMS related to settings
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirements CMS being uh Center for
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so federally uh um and there
 
01:51:53.709 --> 01:51:53.719 align:start position:0%
are restrictions on the types of
 
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:57.800 align:start position:0%
settings that individuals can reside in
 
01:51:59.510 --> 01:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
um and and some of those are new and and
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
if there were a committee uh there might
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity to really take a look
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
at at the way that some of those changes
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
are impacting Residential Services as
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
well thank you well I'm I'm going to
 
01:52:12.709 --> 01:52:12.719 align:start position:0%
step in real quick before I call on
 
01:52:14.669 --> 01:52:14.679 align:start position:0%
representative re it seems to me that
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard is that a lot of
 
01:52:18.270 --> 01:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
the issues are around the licensing the
 
01:52:20.589 --> 01:52:20.599 align:start position:0%
staff resident's requirements
 
01:52:22.229 --> 01:52:22.239 align:start position:0%
like the training requirement code
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
requirements I guess I'm wondering if I
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
I now see that there may be value to
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
studying this as an
 
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
independent thing
 
01:52:36.589 --> 01:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
um if anybody could send me maybe in the
 
01:52:38.830 --> 01:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
public or Marissa you as well could send
 
01:52:42.669 --> 01:52:42.679 align:start position:0%
me a kind of list of regulations or
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
things that are kind of standing in the
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
way from allowing more group residences
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful as
 
01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
well and representative Reed thank you
 
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chair along the chair's question is
 
01:52:59.069 --> 01:52:59.079 align:start position:0%
it fair to say because we've spent some
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
time now just discussing the idea of the
 
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification of just how
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
many people can be in a group home
 
01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
together without or with this particular
 
01:53:11.069 --> 01:53:11.079 align:start position:0%
requirement and that there's a bunch of
 
01:53:13.390 --> 01:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
requirements and this is just one issue
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
of very many issues impacting the ID
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
community and then the ID Community is
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
just one Community out of all the
 
01:53:25.550 --> 01:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
disabled community and so that is the
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
fact that we're getting down the rabbit
 
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:30.320 align:start position:0%
hole and one tiny detail is in fact why
 
01:53:32.629 --> 01:53:32.639 align:start position:0%
you and if you could speak for everybody
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
else in support of the bill why everyone
 
01:53:38.030 --> 01:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
is here asking for a special study
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
committee rather than having our
 
01:53:42.270 --> 01:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
committee who has not ever had a
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
presentation from I think any of the
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
organizations that have been here today
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
or the individuals um why why we are not
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
not quite equipped to deal with this
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
yet was that a statement or is is that
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
the case okay yes I would I would
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree with that and and I
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
want to point out that the things that
 
01:54:05.470 --> 01:54:05.480 align:start position:0%
I've been just presenting specifically
 
01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
requires to or applies to paid
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
residential services that doesn't
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
include all of these families that
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
you've just heard from today who are
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
also struggling because that's the
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
refrain that we are hearing we can never
 
01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:20.709 align:start position:0%
refrain that we are hearing we can never
die

01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
die
 
01:54:23.149 --> 01:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
we always have to be here to take care
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
of our adult children we have to make
 
01:54:28.109 --> 01:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
sure that they're safe and th those I
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's really far-reaching and I
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
I would certainly agree with what you
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
just said or
 
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
shared represent D
 
01:54:38.189 --> 01:54:38.199 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you and thank you for
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question so would you say that
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's a Continuum of Care for these
 
01:54:47.350 --> 01:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
families um an an example is that when
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
the youngsters are in school they're
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
turning 20 2 there's a a period of
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
transition for them and now moving on
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's another period of transition
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
where the individual needs to um be
 
01:55:04.109 --> 01:55:04.119 align:start position:0%
independent and the parents need to you
 
01:55:05.790 --> 01:55:05.800 align:start position:0%
know go their own way and the child
 
01:55:08.109 --> 01:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
needs to go their own way in a perfect
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
world I think that's what people would
 
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
want and they would want that for their
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
adult children to be a choice of of
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
where they would want to
 
01:55:18.599 --> 01:55:20.350 align:start position:0%
where they would want to
go

01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:21.750 align:start position:0%
go
representative

01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
Damon I'm not sure if this would come
 
01:55:26.229 --> 01:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
from you or it's more of a collective
 
01:55:28.830 --> 01:55:28.840 align:start position:0%
question but if we could also get in
 
01:55:31.470 --> 01:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
addition to what representative Al Cher
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
asked for a list of all the
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
organizations who are stakeholders in
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
this most of whom have testified today I
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
know I personally did not know about
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of these organizations as a
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
resource for information so it be
 
01:55:48.870 --> 01:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to have that yes a lot of this
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%
has been educational for the committee
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
so thank you for everybody that has come
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
to testify on this um any other
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions or anybody else thank you Miss
 
01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
Berg for testifying today thank you is
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
there anybody else that would like to
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
testify on HB
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
11168 okay seeing none I'm going to
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HP 11168
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're a little behind schedule so I'm
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
going to a lot behind schedule so I'm
 
01:56:14.750 --> 01:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to kick off um the hearing on hp10
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
I overestimated how long underestimated
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
how long that hearing would be um so I'm
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to the public hearing on
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
h1065 and I'll call on the prime sponsor
 
01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:35.629 align:start position:0%
h1065 and I'll call on the prime sponsor
representative

01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
everyone uh for the record
 
01:56:41.669 --> 01:56:41.679 align:start position:0%
representative hope Damon Sullivan
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
District 8 um nine towns with diverse
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
housing needs um so this is House Bill
 
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
1065 which is relative to fire sprinkler
 
01:56:57.149 --> 01:56:57.159 align:start position:0%
requirements in residential
 
01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
buildings um it would create an
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
exception to the state fire code for
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in existing
 
01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:06.109 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems in existing
residential

01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:57:09.069 --> 01:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
buildings so that the sprinklers are not
 
01:57:12.069 --> 01:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
required if you have four or less units
 
01:57:14.589 --> 01:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
in these existing buildings the current
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
standard has been two units are exempt
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
from sprinkler
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
um I put this bill forward as a
 
01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:27.800 align:start position:0%
placeholder basically so that if the
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
building code and fire code folks did
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
not accomplish this in their process of
 
01:57:37.390 --> 01:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing and updating codes that we
 
01:57:39.870 --> 01:57:39.880 align:start position:0%
could address it in statute and I
 
01:57:41.310 --> 01:57:41.320 align:start position:0%
believe you will probably hear from
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
folks who I think are behind me um that
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
that actually has been accomplished I
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
think at this point it is just pending
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
legislative approval of these revisions
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
in the codes so to be quite Frank I'm
 
01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
not really sure that we need to proceed
 
01:58:00.229 --> 01:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
with the statute uh
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion okay thank you very much for
 
01:58:05.669 --> 01:58:05.679 align:start position:0%
your testimony if it's a
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
question specifically for represented
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
amen go
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
question so is it your testimony that
 
01:58:19.390 --> 01:58:19.400 align:start position:0%
you don't see a value in in having it in
 
01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
statute because in current in current
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
statute we have it saying no more than
 
01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh no requirements in in one and
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
two and
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
um just just because they have this in
 
01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
this particular code does not
 
01:58:41.350 --> 01:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean they could propose a
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
code in the future um that that did not
 
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
and so if it was in statute wouldn't
 
01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:50.679 align:start position:0%
that be a better protection I guess what
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
um can you share your thoughts on that
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question it's a
 
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
um I think there's always a value
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
judgment between what is a regulation
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
and what need is there for a law so my
 
01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:11.910 align:start position:0%
and what need is there for a law so my
understanding

01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
is that the building code and the fire
 
01:59:17.229 --> 01:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
code are what is utilized in communities
 
01:59:20.510 --> 01:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
as to what is okay to do or not
 
01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.270 align:start position:0%
as to what is okay to do or not
do

01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:59:24.950 --> 01:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I think I'll just pause there
 
01:59:26.709 --> 01:59:26.719 align:start position:0%
because I think the folks behind me will
 
01:59:28.589 --> 01:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
give you a more clear answer of that
 
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory process and that will be a
 
01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:33.199 align:start position:0%
decision for the committee to make about
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
whether we want to put it into statute
 
01:59:38.629 --> 01:59:38.639 align:start position:0%
or whether it's not
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
necessary representative Reed thank you
 
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
question and I apologize I stepped out
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
very briefly I didn't hear everything
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
you said but I believe and I'm just
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
asking for um you to verify that
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
currently on the state level anything
 
01:59:57.550 --> 01:59:57.560 align:start position:0%
over two units would require sprinkler
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
and this would make it so that it would
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
be anything for and Below would not
 
02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:03.639 align:start position:0%
require a sprinkler system is that
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
correct but that as being apparently
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
handled administratively we hope all of
 
02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
what you said is correct thank
 
02:00:14.430 --> 02:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you very much
 
02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
representative so seeing how this is a
 
02:00:19.229 --> 02:00:19.239 align:start position:0%
special committee there's a lot of bills
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
that we're hearing today that members of
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
this committee are sponsors on and
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
typically sponsors have not asked
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
questions but I'm going to defer it to
 
02:00:28.669 --> 02:00:28.679 align:start position:0%
these special circumstances that some of
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
these bills we have worked on um all of
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
last year and we've gotten solicitation
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
from stakeholders so some may ask
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions that are co-sponsors on the
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
bill so please allow that today um the
 
02:00:40.950 --> 02:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
next up I'm going to hear from is uh
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:48.119 --> 02:00:54.270 align:start position:0%
 
office

02:00:54.270 --> 02:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
morning Mr Shar and members of the
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having me the
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
record my name is Sean Tumi I serve as
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
our State Fire Marshal uh I've been
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
working with representative Damon a bit
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
on this uh I think since probably uh
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
last summer um we had heard uh probably
 
02:01:11.310 --> 02:01:11.320 align:start position:0%
almost a year ago we had heard some
 
02:01:14.069 --> 02:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the sprinklers and up to
 
02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
four families for existing projects and
 
02:01:19.470 --> 02:01:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh I was able to handle this on a
 
02:01:22.350 --> 02:01:22.360 align:start position:0%
variance basis and uh in the past
 
02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
depending on the project um and that we
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have that same capability on the
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
building code so we Revisited with a
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
group of stakeholders this summer um and
 
02:01:33.550 --> 02:01:33.560 align:start position:0%
we developed a building code Amendment
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
and a fire code Amendment the building
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'll let uh the chair of the building
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
code review Phil Sherman who's behind me
 
02:01:41.229 --> 02:01:41.239 align:start position:0%
talk on the building code side a bit but
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh on the SARS of fire code side we
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
developed an amendment put in front of
 
02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
the board of Fire Control Board of Fire
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
Control approved it it went to the
 
02:01:49.629 --> 02:01:49.639 align:start position:0%
legislative advisory on building and
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
fire codes uh they recommended it to
 
02:01:53.709 --> 02:01:53.719 align:start position:0%
move forward and for legislation this
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
year the fire code bill is Senate Bill
 
02:01:57.629 --> 02:01:57.639 align:start position:0%
599 which was heard this week in the
 
02:02:00.750 --> 02:02:00.760 align:start position:0%
Senate Edna it was passed uh and is on
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
consent uh for um it's on the consent
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
calendar for w this coming Wednesday the
 
02:02:08.870 --> 02:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
21st so what we did on the fire code
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
side is that uh for units up to four
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
dwelling units um they would have to
 
02:02:16.109 --> 02:02:16.119 align:start position:0%
meet the existing uh requirements for
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
residential apartment buildings in the
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
fire code so just to be clear it's there
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
is a existing chapter for apartments and
 
02:02:24.550 --> 02:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
then there's a new chapter for
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
apartments and there are is a difference
 
02:02:28.669 --> 02:02:28.679 align:start position:0%
new does require sprinklers existing
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
women unless there's a very weird
 
02:02:33.229 --> 02:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstance so I guess I I
 
02:02:35.310 --> 02:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
I I mentioned oppose and I only oppose
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
the bill in the sense that I don't think
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is necessary because we have a
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
a uh a process in the state for building
 
02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
and fire codes building code amendments
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
go through the building code review
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
board stakeholders bring them forward
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
the board hears them there a group of
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
for professionals uh those amendments
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
get heard through public hearing and
 
02:02:55.870 --> 02:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
then uh they go up through to this the
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
advisory committee that I mentioned
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
legislative advisory committee and then
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
heard by the general court and approved
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
and ratified through the general court
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
on the fire code side the same process
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
accept it's the board of Fire Control
 
02:03:08.350 --> 02:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
hears those and they come through to
 
02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
your point representative ukel
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
the I think the Trust In not making sure
 
02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:15.320 align:start position:0%
we change something in the future the
 
02:03:17.830 --> 02:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
boards can't just make something up uh
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
without the the legislature approving it
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
so we can't um we can't just arbitrarily
 
02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
say we're going to take this away
 
02:03:27.709 --> 02:03:27.719 align:start position:0%
without you guys having visibility on
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
that change because you guys have the
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
ability we we recommend building a fire
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
codes they with the Committees with the
 
02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input and everything like
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
that the one um only other consideration
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
I I suggest and know expanding it in the
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
statute is that we've worked really hard
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
over the last several years to have um
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
more transparency on the building and
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
fire code process and and um my office
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
was tasked with having uh building out a
 
02:03:55.990 --> 02:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
website and having the this is the state
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
building of fire code these are the
 
02:03:59.310 --> 02:03:59.320 align:start position:0%
state building and fire code amendments
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
and then go so far as these are the
 
02:04:03.629 --> 02:04:03.639 align:start position:0%
local amendments that have been properly
 
02:04:07.310 --> 02:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
vetted um lawfully eded um vetted at the
 
02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
local level and then they're not in
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
conflict with our state building and
 
02:04:12.390 --> 02:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
fire code so we're just starting to
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
build out that process we have I think
 
02:04:15.149 --> 02:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
we have four communities that have
 
02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
submitted the information it's up on our
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
website now but there's some bill is
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
going on right now to try to strengthen
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more so that we have a
 
02:04:24.030 --> 02:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
very clear process for the end users in
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that this is our state
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
code these are our state amendments and
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
oh by the way if you want to build in
 
02:04:30.430 --> 02:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
the city of conquer this is where you
 
02:04:31.950 --> 02:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
find the local amendments that have been
 
02:04:33.910 --> 02:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've been verified that they're locally
 
02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
they're lawfully amended so I think that
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
summarizes things um happy to try to
 
02:04:40.629 --> 02:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you Mr Tumi
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
represent yell thank you thank you for
 
02:04:45.270 --> 02:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
taking the question um you mentioned
 
02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
local amendments um is it your
 
02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:49.270 align:start position:0%
local amendments um is it your
understanding

02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
that um let's say the city of Concord
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
could have a local amendment that
 
02:04:58.149 --> 02:04:58.159 align:start position:0%
requires sprinkler systems even though
 
02:04:58.159 --> 02:04:58.950 align:start position:0%
requires sprinkler systems even though
the

02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
state uh fire code did not require
 
02:05:04.549 --> 02:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for for three and
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
four uh uh Apartments three dwelling
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
Apartments um could they essentially uh
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
have that local option because it's not
 
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
in Conflict um and and that the
 
02:05:23.510 --> 02:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislation could serve as a purp uh its
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
purpose as far as barring that local
 
02:05:30.430 --> 02:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
option um from being occurred or am I
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding the the the impact of
 
02:05:36.430 --> 02:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
such legislation no thank you no that
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
there you're accurate the locals have
 
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to put a a local Amendment
 
02:05:41.910 --> 02:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's more restrictive than the state
 
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
codes um I think the
 
02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
codes um I think the
only

02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
only
 
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
um I think we got to be very careful
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
when we put code language in the
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
statutes because it doesn't look at the
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
bigger picture of like the we're just
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
narrowing focus on the sprinklers we got
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
to look at the whole package for the the
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
safety of the people living in the in
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
the property right so um if we look at
 
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
just the sprinkler requirements we don't
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
look at egress and fire other Fire
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
Protection Systems um we've kind of lost
 
02:06:12.790 --> 02:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh sight of the whole code package in
 
02:06:15.709 --> 02:06:15.719 align:start position:0%
the design so I think that's where from
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
us on the code side we're trying to
 
02:06:18.910 --> 02:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize if we need to make an
 
02:06:20.750 --> 02:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
amendment we really want to make it and
 
02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
ratify it at the through the the state
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
process I understand there's a little
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a wild card um at the local level
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
I think with the the work that we're
 
02:06:31.910 --> 02:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
doing through the Amendments and they're
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
having to come to the boards for review
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
um and we're staying more up to date on
 
02:06:37.870 --> 02:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
our codes in general in the state we're
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
trying to say one code cycle behind
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get away from that sort
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
of wild card of people doing things that
 
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
are kind of almost Rogue from what the
 
02:06:50.669 --> 02:06:50.679 align:start position:0%
state the stadium back star it's not
 
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
totally impossible though I will say
 
02:06:57.390 --> 02:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
that thank you and this may be a little
 
02:06:59.990 --> 02:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
outside of the scope of this bill but um
 
02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's valuable information for
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
the committee what types of um local
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
additional uh restrictions I guess on on
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
housing or any anything regarding uh
 
02:07:18.229 --> 02:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
fire are you seeing I guess um across
 
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
the State um that may be an issue for
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
this you know reducing or increasing the
 
02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
cost of housing or whatever the case may
 
02:07:29.950 --> 02:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
be that's a tough one for o General so I
 
02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
mean I think the two that really come to
 
02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
mind when we talk about it is um
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
Durham's approach on the energy code and
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
apply advancing the energy code beyond
 
02:07:40.430 --> 02:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
what the state is and then I've heard
 
02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
that of Portsmouth having a adopting a
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
later version of the electrical code
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
those are the two that typically come to
 
02:07:49.549 --> 02:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
mind as the bigger concerns um um we
 
02:07:50.990 --> 02:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
haven't found all of the local
 
02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
amendments yet because we just have got
 
02:07:55.750 --> 02:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
the position in place to do it um but
 
02:07:57.549 --> 02:07:57.559 align:start position:0%
those those are the ones we typically
 
02:08:00.510 --> 02:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
hear um the only other thing we hear is
 
02:08:03.149 --> 02:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
that um I just heard it this morning
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
like that we have an existing building
 
02:08:07.549 --> 02:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
code and we need to continue to educate
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
code officials to follow our existing
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
building code we have existing
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the fire code I have to
 
02:08:14.750 --> 02:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
work to continue to educate fire
 
02:08:16.589 --> 02:08:16.599 align:start position:0%
officials in our state that we have an
 
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
existing Pro existing building process
 
02:08:20.229 --> 02:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to renovate a
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
building there it's different than if
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
you straight up new construction I think
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
that's where um from the code official
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
perspective I think that's where some of
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
the challenges come into play is that
 
02:08:33.549 --> 02:08:33.559 align:start position:0%
they're not maybe applying the code as
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
as um as great as we could sometimes um
 
02:08:39.109 --> 02:08:39.119 align:start position:0%
but I don't I can't speak to every
 
02:08:40.629 --> 02:08:40.639 align:start position:0%
specific Amendment yet because we don't
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
we haven't captured all that
 
02:08:46.350 --> 02:08:46.360 align:start position:0%
data I mean I think if you've if I if
 
02:08:49.270 --> 02:08:49.280 align:start position:0%
you happen to uh come across anything
 
02:08:51.669 --> 02:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
that in in the next you know year as
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
we're as we're committee um can you
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
forward that information on to us I'm
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
sure we would be interested absolutely
 
02:09:01.229 --> 02:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
as you as you learn anything okay um
 
02:09:05.470 --> 02:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
represent makoni um thank you U chairman
 
02:09:05.480 --> 02:09:07.229 align:start position:0%
represent makoni um thank you U chairman
Alexander

02:09:07.229 --> 02:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
um Marshall Tumi nice to see you um once
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
again I perhaps you could help me I'm
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
somewhat confused here is it my
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that a process is underway
 
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
right now which will allow apartment
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
units of three and four in existing
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
buildings can vacate having to have uh
 
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:33.800 align:start position:0%
sprinklers but new construction still
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
requires three or four that that will be
 
02:09:38.430 --> 02:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
the case that is correct as we that's
 
02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
follow living a little further up north
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:09:51.390 --> 02:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
and you you speak of this process for
 
02:09:53.270 --> 02:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
amendments and so
 
02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:55.270 align:start position:0%
amendments and so
forth

02:09:55.270 --> 02:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
forth
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
is is it still possible for a fire chief
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
up North with this understanding when
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's in place and perhaps this a Senate
 
02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:04.350 align:start position:0%
it's in place and perhaps this a Senate
Bill

02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
599 that they would still say in my town
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
in a building that's existing with three
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
or four units uh that sprinklers is
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
still required they should not do that
 
02:10:18.709 --> 02:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
unless they have a lawful Reas reason to
 
02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
do so I will say that um we continue to
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
hear challenges sometimes of code
 
02:10:26.830 --> 02:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
officials fire in building saying I want
 
02:10:28.990 --> 02:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
this for these reasons to your point up
 
02:10:31.270 --> 02:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
north I think this is this is a classic
 
02:10:33.870 --> 02:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
example of why we're doing some of this
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
um one example was in recently was in
 
02:10:39.189 --> 02:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
gorum you know old big Victorian home
 
02:10:41.229 --> 02:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
the other one's in Claremont I think we
 
02:10:44.950 --> 02:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
had but it was always a a home at some
 
02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:46.559 align:start position:0%
point the first floor converted to a
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
business use and there's still two unit
 
02:10:50.270 --> 02:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
units say upstairs and now we want to
 
02:10:52.470 --> 02:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
put one or two units on our first floor
 
02:10:54.030 --> 02:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
and currently we can't do that without
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
having to sprinkle the entire building
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
the line I often use in this case is you
 
02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
could probably trip and fall and land
 
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:04.040 align:start position:0%
outside um but we can't without
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
sprinkling the whole building so um I
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
think that I I think that the amendment
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
that we created which is mirrors what
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
the ask is in this uh language here um
 
02:11:17.069 --> 02:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
will address what we've been talking
 
02:11:18.589 --> 02:11:18.599 align:start position:0%
about for the last probably year and a
 
02:11:21.189 --> 02:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
half on the building of Firecat side and
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
and and finally and thank you so much
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
for helping me um understand that but in
 
02:11:29.830 --> 02:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the event that there was a fire chief
 
02:11:32.109 --> 02:11:32.119 align:start position:0%
that held up the process and said we
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
were going he felt for safety purposes
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
in this Victorian home or whatever that
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
um this was going to be required there
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no action that could
 
02:11:46.390 --> 02:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
be taken by the developer against that
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
fire chep is there or would your
 
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
department step in and and be the go
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
between on that so typically what
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
happens people often start the local
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
level with their administrators or
 
02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and then very often we'll get
 
02:12:03.030 --> 02:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
involved and try to help educate on the
 
02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
code perspective um sometimes I've asked
 
02:12:09.669 --> 02:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
people to put a variance in um which is
 
02:12:11.510 --> 02:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
a simple just quick application and that
 
02:12:13.270 --> 02:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
opens the door much cleaner for us to
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
come come in and say this is you know
 
02:12:17.149 --> 02:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
these are this is the interpretation of
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
the fire code and I would say more often
 
02:12:21.629 --> 02:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
than not we've been successful when
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
we've been involved we clearly don't get
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
involved in every single case um and
 
02:12:29.350 --> 02:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
so there are still those issues out
 
02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
there I I think the hard part because
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'll reiterate on
 
02:12:37.589 --> 02:12:37.599 align:start position:0%
the the more we add code stuff buried in
 
02:12:39.629 --> 02:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
different parts of the statute from a
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
user perspective it it's very
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
challenging as we educate people of as I
 
02:12:46.990 --> 02:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
go back to this is a state code this is
 
02:12:49.669 --> 02:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
a state amendments and then oh by the
 
02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
way you got to go look in 155a you got
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
to go look in 153 you got to look at
 
02:12:58.310 --> 02:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
154 um and others um and it just it it's
 
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
very hard from a designer and end user
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
as we start burying code amendments in
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
different parts of the um code from a
 
02:13:05.199 --> 02:13:06.390 align:start position:0%
different parts of the um code from a
user

02:13:06.390 --> 02:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
user
 
02:13:09.910 --> 02:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
perspective go ahead and
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
um Devil's AB could can you if it's if
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's fine for four residential units
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
existing and anyone building a new
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
building has to follow a much better um
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
most likely a much more
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
stringent um set of uh construction
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
details insulation and wiring and
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
everything else for a simple person like
 
02:13:43.629 --> 02:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
me why isn't that okay also so I guess
 
02:13:46.350 --> 02:13:46.360 align:start position:0%
I'll back up a quick minute so the the
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
reson the fire problem in the in our
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
state and across the country we're
 
02:13:52.709 --> 02:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
losing about a dozen people here fire
 
02:13:57.870 --> 02:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
deaths in homes um one and two family
 
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
homes on the from a code perspective
 
02:14:02.750 --> 02:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
have been required sprinkle systems for
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
probably 20 years or so now uh we we
 
02:14:08.189 --> 02:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
chose to take them out make it a user
 
02:14:10.390 --> 02:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know end user decision for our own
 
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
our own being and I'm okay with that um
 
02:14:14.830 --> 02:14:14.840 align:start position:0%
I I'm will just educate on the value of
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
the sprinkle system as we add more
 
02:14:21.030 --> 02:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
people and to bake the buildings bigger
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
um especially for I'd say a
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
new the your impact within your unit has
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
a bigger impact on others that I think
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's always the way I think about it
 
02:14:35.149 --> 02:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
right so as we grow into say the four
 
02:14:37.390 --> 02:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
units or six units or like where like
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
where does this stop
 
02:14:42.669 --> 02:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
um if there were a fire in our in our
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
homes or in our apartment
 
02:14:47.189 --> 02:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
building you're going to be you know you
 
02:14:49.149 --> 02:14:49.159 align:start position:0%
can your care and concern about other
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
people within the building only go so
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
far so we were all t as youths right to
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
have a meeting place at our home right
 
02:14:57.790 --> 02:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
go go to the I tell my kids to go to the
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
chicken coop in the front yard well and
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go out and make sure my two
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
kids and my wife are out there when when
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
you have a huge apartment building you
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
might not know who all the people are in
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
the building and that I think that's
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
from a safety perspective what where the
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
sprinklers become more important uh from
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're proven to to save lives
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
and property the losses are are less
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
from the existing versus new it's more
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
expensive to put a Sprinkle system in an
 
02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
existing building um in new construction
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're already in the street digging up
 
02:15:30.669 --> 02:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
for water if we have water supply
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
available for water and sewer if you're
 
02:15:34.830 --> 02:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
already on the property if you don't
 
02:15:36.149 --> 02:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
have water sewer to your point in the
 
02:15:38.669 --> 02:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
North Country we're we're we're putting
 
02:15:40.750 --> 02:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
septic systems in Wells in and stuff
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
you're doing the necessary excavation to
 
02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
get the water supplies in place um it's
 
02:15:47.470 --> 02:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
different than if you're resisting home
 
02:15:48.950 --> 02:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
if you
 
02:15:50.790 --> 02:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
I worked at conquered fire before I was
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the fire Marshall's office I tried to
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
put sprinkler systems in the fire
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
stations it was going to cost us a
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of money to go in dig
 
02:15:59.709 --> 02:15:59.719 align:start position:0%
into North Main Street for the central
 
02:16:02.189 --> 02:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
fire station uh because they just paved
 
02:16:04.310 --> 02:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
the road so that that becomes an
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
obstacle and I think that's where some
 
02:16:07.830 --> 02:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
of the things are you think about with
 
02:16:10.669 --> 02:16:10.679 align:start position:0%
these existing buildings is it's harder
 
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
to it's harder because of all the other
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
Rules and Things to to facilitate um
 
02:16:19.310 --> 02:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
water supply and things like that in
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
existing in existing building thank you
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
sir thank you Mr chairman of
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
course um yeah I'm going to call
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
Representative Gibbs and then
 
02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.510 align:start position:0%
Representative Gibbs and then
representative

02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
you Marshall Tumi for being here and
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
speaking with us um you mentioned uh
 
02:16:43.469 --> 02:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
that there are problems with uh local um
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh Fire Chiefs uh and local authorities
 
02:16:49.589 --> 02:16:49.599 align:start position:0%
not being famili amiliar enough with the
 
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
state fire codes and also uh that
 
02:16:55.669 --> 02:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes there are problems where your
 
02:16:58.950 --> 02:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
office uh steps in and provides
 
02:17:02.750 --> 02:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
educational uh provides education uh to
 
02:17:05.549 --> 02:17:05.559 align:start position:0%
try to resolve that problem but can you
 
02:17:09.629 --> 02:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
tell us um are there any uh broader
 
02:17:12.589 --> 02:17:12.599 align:start position:0%
efforts that you make to acquaint local
 
02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
officials with the state fire codes sure
 
02:17:18.270 --> 02:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so in my ten
 
02:17:20.469 --> 02:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
years of Fire Marshall uh which started
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
in June of 21 we implemented a training
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
program that we try to deliver our goal
 
02:17:27.750 --> 02:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
is to deliver two um sort of continuent
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
Education uh fire code topics in
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
different areas of the state each month
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
um we've got uh we're doing a bunch on
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
heating gas Appliance related
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
inspections in the in this coming month
 
02:17:41.709 --> 02:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh we did some scenario based questions
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
and answers on fire code so we travel
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
across the state and do course delivery
 
02:17:48.830 --> 02:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
and we usually get a dozen to two dozen
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
code official fire code officials
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
typically coming in to learn about it
 
02:17:54.990 --> 02:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
and our the goal for my office really is
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh consistent enforcement of the fire
 
02:17:56.679 --> 02:17:58.309 align:start position:0%
uh consistent enforcement of the fire
code

02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
code
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
um you you're welcome represent
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
Marshall Tumi and I should have um
 
02:18:12.070 --> 02:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledged in my introduction how
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
helpful you and also Phil Sherman with
 
02:18:17.030 --> 02:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
the building code reboot board have been
 
02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.070 align:start position:0%
the building code reboot board have been
um

02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm wanting to ask in regards to your
 
02:18:23.629 --> 02:18:23.639 align:start position:0%
remark a minute ago about there are some
 
02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
issues with code compliance and local
 
02:18:28.830 --> 02:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation if I'm paraphrasing what
 
02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
interpretation if I'm paraphrasing what
you

02:18:29.669 --> 02:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
said is there anything you would
 
02:18:35.230 --> 02:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
recommend that we be looking at in terms
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
of Statute around who is a code
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
compliance officer or how they proceed
 
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
that is there anything that would be
 
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
helpful in that regard I think I'm going
 
02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
to get daggers if I answer that question
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
but one of the things things that's come
 
02:18:49.309 --> 02:18:49.319 align:start position:0%
up in the past is of course
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
certification and education I think
 
02:18:53.830 --> 02:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's the key to it right we our fire
 
02:18:55.150 --> 02:18:55.160 align:start position:0%
academy in the state we have a fire
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
inspector 2 and a fire inspector uh
 
02:18:58.669 --> 02:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me fire inspector one program and
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
a fire inspector 2 program we try to
 
02:19:02.230 --> 02:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
encourage anyone that's doing
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
inspectional work to get certified um
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
and then continue your education uh and
 
02:19:09.309 --> 02:19:09.319 align:start position:0%
I think that what comes up frequently
 
02:19:10.429 --> 02:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I haven't heard it for a couple
 
02:19:12.429 --> 02:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
years now but is there requirements for
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
getting people certified there's no
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
requirement for people to be certified
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
to do code enforcement work uh the
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
building officials Association does
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
phenomenal work they have monthly
 
02:19:24.309 --> 02:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
trainings there's opportunities for
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
certification on their path there's
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
opportunities on our path as well um but
 
02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
we need to just continue to if you're
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
going to be a code official get yourself
 
02:19:35.709 --> 02:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
educated um and you know reach out to uh
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
the other experts in our state to help
 
02:19:42.509 --> 02:19:42.519 align:start position:0%
you um interpret and use the codes when
 
02:19:44.669 --> 02:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
necessary I appreciate that answer and
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'll try to pull the daggers out of your
 
02:19:50.070 --> 02:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative bery thank
 
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
um um Marshall Tumi you've been a
 
02:19:57.110 --> 02:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
marshall for 10 years
 
02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
now in the last 10 years um do you have
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
an average of how many people been I he
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
started in 2021 so it's I think it's
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
only a couple years right oh I thought
 
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
you said 10 years he has a 10-year term
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
if I okay foure term four term four term
 
02:20:16.469 --> 02:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
well in your experience as far back as
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
you can think about how many people a
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
year do we lose to fires in New
 
02:20:24.429 --> 02:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in one to four unit building
 
02:20:27.190 --> 02:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
in one to four unit I I don't I don't
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
know that statistic right off the top of
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
my head I can tell you we lose about a
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
dozen people a year in residential fires
 
02:20:39.309 --> 02:20:39.319 align:start position:0%
um our office investigated uh 24 fire uh
 
02:20:42.790 --> 02:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
24 fatalities last year um which 12 of
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
them ended up being in in the
 
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
residential setting and that seems to be
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
about the trend we've gone as high as
 
02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:50.200 align:start position:0%
you know in the 20s and we've dipped a
 
02:20:51.750 --> 02:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
little bit lower than that but I can get
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
you some more specifics on fire Death
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
data one of I think one of the things
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
that we you will see and if depending on
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
what testimony behind me but the
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
National Fire Protection Association uh
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
collects data for um incidents across
 
02:21:09.070 --> 02:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
the country and they compile that and
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we looked at when
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
we we u considered Amendment for this
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
was uh looking at the apartments
 
02:21:19.030 --> 02:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
specifically across Ross the last many
 
02:21:23.469 --> 02:21:23.479 align:start position:0%
decades the the the curve is pretty flat
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
as far as uh residential apartment fires
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
um I will say my my only concern about
 
02:21:35.469 --> 02:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
um as we diminish Life Safety in in
 
02:21:37.710 --> 02:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
apartments we you know we talk we've
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
we've heard conversations about um
 
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
modern construction techniques talked
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
about changes in furniture and more
 
02:21:46.349 --> 02:21:46.359 align:start position:0%
flammability of furniture we hear about
 
02:21:48.349 --> 02:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
the emobility devices that are having
 
02:21:50.389 --> 02:21:50.399 align:start position:0%
fire issues so I think we got to make
 
02:21:52.349 --> 02:21:52.359 align:start position:0%
sure we continue to watch and balance
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
the fire safety requirements with the
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
newer stuff that's coming out um make
 
02:21:59.349 --> 02:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
sure we don't go backwards right so um
 
02:22:01.469 --> 02:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
in the 70s we added smoke alarms and
 
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
that had a significant decline in fire
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
deaths um I I guess as a State Fire
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
Marshal I would hate to go backwards
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's all um so I think we're just
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to continue to evaluate that but
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh about a dozen deaths a year I can get
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
more uh detail of you if you want to but
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay um a followup we're talking about
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
one to four units so it's a a small
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
apartment building buyes that we're
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
really looking at here so if you can get
 
02:22:33.590 --> 02:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
us some kind of number on that I'd
 
02:22:35.110 --> 02:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I'll see what I'll see
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
what I can do for you sir yeah smoke
 
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
alarms really work because I fall asleep
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
once in a while when I'm cooking and
 
02:22:44.590 --> 02:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
goes off and it's time to get
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
up yeah thank you thank you couple two
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
many years Ellen representative
 
02:22:54.590 --> 02:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:22:56.030 --> 02:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and for your
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
testimony and your work um in kind of
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
piggybacking on representative barudi I
 
02:23:03.389 --> 02:23:03.399 align:start position:0%
would specifically like the numbers
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
because this is really just affecting
 
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
the three and four units specifically
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
like any numbers you can generate around
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
three and four unit uh fires where it
 
02:23:17.269 --> 02:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
was in the fire happened specifically
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
because of a carryover from one unit to
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
another because I think that's what
 
02:23:24.349 --> 02:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
that's the rationale behind the more
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
units there you need a a sprinkler
 
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
system and but my question so I was just
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
adding to that request but my question
 
02:23:34.030 --> 02:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
is because I really just want to be very
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
clear about the difference between this
 
02:23:37.469 --> 02:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and what is in the
 
02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
Senate bill that was recommended uh in
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the fire code so the differences are
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
this would be binding on municipalities
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
and that they could not
 
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:49.960 align:start position:0%
require a sprinkler system on anything
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
up through four units um the Senate Bill
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
version it would not be entirely binding
 
02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
the other difference is that the Senate
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
Bill version would not would would would
 
02:24:05.389 --> 02:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
allow the requirement for um for three
 
02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
and four units if they are new whereas
 
02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
this one would not um and I think those
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
are the only are those the are those
 
02:24:15.750 --> 02:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
differences accurate what I just said
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
and are there any other differences
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
between this and the sen version can you
 
02:24:21.030 --> 02:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh just back up on your new existing one
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I I think I missed that one
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay I'm trying to I'm trying I'm trying
 
02:24:27.389 --> 02:24:27.399 align:start position:0%
to understand the difference between
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
this bill and the Senate version um and
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the two major
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
differences are this would be absolutely
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
binding on municipalities they would not
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
be able to require a sprinkler system on
 
02:24:41.710 --> 02:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
anything up through four units the
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bill it wouldn't be technically
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
entirely binding so towns could but then
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying that they probably
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't but they could um the second
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
one is the Senate Bill version this
 
02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
would say it's new or new construction
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
or existing you can't require and the
 
02:25:01.990 --> 02:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill version would allow
 
02:25:04.590 --> 02:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
requiring for new construction even
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
though as it was pointed out new
 
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:08.200 align:start position:0%
construction is generally more in
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with upto-date standards
 
02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so this um this bill and the
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill amendment is is for existing
 
02:25:22.190 --> 02:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
buildings only both of them um they both
 
02:25:24.429 --> 02:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
would allow Renovations in existing
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
buildings so you would be allowed to
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
create uh up to so you had a two family
 
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
and you wanted to create four family
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
within the same space or you know you go
 
02:25:35.590 --> 02:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
up to four families within the same
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
space uh from that construction
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
perspective but a ground up new building
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
is not contemplated in this bill or the
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill does that help answer that
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:50.950 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill does that help answer that
part

02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't see that maybe it might be in
 
02:25:55.630 --> 02:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
the section it's under that's not listed
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't see anything any reference
 
02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
oh sorry shall not be required an
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
existing residential so what you're
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
saying is that both this and the Senate
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
Bill apply to an existing structure that
 
02:26:09.910 --> 02:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
wants to increase the the number of
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
units in that structure so if it's they
 
02:26:14.269 --> 02:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to build an apartment or whatever
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
so both of them would be
 
02:26:19.950 --> 02:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
this one binding the Senate one not but
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
would be um getting rid of in general
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the requirement for
 
02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
sprinklers on anything up through four
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
units as we talk through this and I just
 
02:26:32.910 --> 02:26:32.920 align:start position:0%
sort of think out loud a little bit the
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
probably The Binding part is the
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably the big part of it
 
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
um hoping the local doesn't try to
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
circumvent this somehow the only other
 
02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
thing that I as I look through the
 
02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
current l language that we have this
 
02:26:50.870 --> 02:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
starts to talk about fire barriers and
 
02:26:53.469 --> 02:26:53.479 align:start position:0%
egress and things like that I think that
 
02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
the code expands on that much better um
 
02:27:00.590 --> 02:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
and that almost I think muddies the
 
02:27:02.190 --> 02:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
waters a little bit when we start trying
 
02:27:03.950 --> 02:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
to intermingle other little code
 
02:27:06.950 --> 02:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
components without the background of the
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
code in the statute
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't if the committee felt that it was
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary to have this in
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
place I feel like it would be more
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to say existing residential
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
no more than for dwellings and comply
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
with exist like the exist I'm thinking a
 
02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
lot of it but the existing provisions of
 
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
the Life Safety Code the state fire code
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
and the State Building Code and point
 
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
them back to the other separation
 
02:27:38.910 --> 02:27:38.920 align:start position:0%
requirements ESS requirements and things
 
02:27:40.790 --> 02:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
like that but I mean we'll get in the
 
02:27:43.349 --> 02:27:43.359 align:start position:0%
weeds I'm happy to work with you guys uh
 
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
if if you have those concerns we need to
 
02:27:49.269 --> 02:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
go down this road but but um I'm
 
02:27:51.309 --> 02:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
cautiously optimistic that the local
 
02:27:53.349 --> 02:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
officials might not go astray but I can
 
02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
that um you're more optimistic than I am
 
02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:28:09.309 --> 02:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
again um I'm wondering if you could in
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
addition to what's been requested about
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
data on loss of life which is
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
clearly what we most want to prevent but
 
02:28:20.910 --> 02:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
could you also provide us some data on
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
loss of housing due to fires if that
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
exists um thinking on a just recent
 
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
example in one of the communities I
 
02:28:35.790 --> 02:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
represent cipe we lost a historic old
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
building and uh close to two dozen
 
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
people are homeless because of that
 
02:28:43.150 --> 02:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
there there's no place for them to live
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
I think there was a six 14 or 16 unit
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
building I was up there for for that one
 
02:28:49.349 --> 02:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure you were quite a
 
02:28:51.790 --> 02:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
scene I will do my best to try to
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
capture some of that data um I might try
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
to get as invest as I can Hampshire
 
02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
stuff and then I'll get try to get some
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the national numbers I I I will you
 
02:29:04.670 --> 02:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
know the national numbers are relative
 
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
flat on the desks and stuff like that on
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
the but I I'll work to get you some of
 
02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
that information to help I I appreciate
 
02:29:14.790 --> 02:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
that and you know General is fine it
 
02:29:17.150 --> 02:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be uh long involved
 
02:29:18.349 --> 02:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
process for you I know you have a lot to
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
do okay thank you represent y thank you
 
02:29:26.030 --> 02:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking the question
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
um some of the people seem to be as far
 
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
as like the Quest for for data regarding
 
02:29:36.510 --> 02:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
the deaths looking specifically for two
 
02:29:42.950 --> 02:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
and three or uh three and four sorry
 
02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but I am not as focused on that I
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
would like to see kind of going back to
 
02:29:53.469 --> 02:29:53.479 align:start position:0%
your statement before as far as
 
02:29:56.670 --> 02:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in general
 
02:30:02.349 --> 02:30:02.359 align:start position:0%
are saving lives um if we I'm interested
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
in any of the data that you have that
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
indicates that um maybe even in a one
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
person or one one uh one family
 
02:30:19.110 --> 02:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
dwelling that they didn't have a fire
 
02:30:21.389 --> 02:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
fire sprinkler system and there was a
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
death um I would be interested in that
 
02:30:24.479 --> 02:30:26.150 align:start position:0%
death um I would be interested in that
versus

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
versus
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
um versus if there was a death in in a
 
02:30:31.950 --> 02:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
situation where there was a fire a
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system or you know if there
 
02:30:38.030 --> 02:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
was 100% all of the deaths in were were
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
in people that did not have sprinkler
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
systems that would be interesting data
 
02:30:45.990 --> 02:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
to me um so if you have that get info
 
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Gibbs thank you
 
02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
Marshall Tumi um you've mentioned the
 
02:30:55.389 --> 02:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
desirability of including all the
 
02:30:58.670 --> 02:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
requirements um in the fire code ruled
 
02:31:00.469 --> 02:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
rather than having them peac meal in
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
various statutes and that makes a lot of
 
02:31:05.910 --> 02:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
sense to me but if I understood
 
02:31:08.750 --> 02:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
correctly what's been said up to now
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
while this proposed uh bill would
 
02:31:17.070 --> 02:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
prevent local uh Fire Authority
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
from requiring sprinklers in existing
 
02:31:24.389 --> 02:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
buildings uh with uh three or four units
 
02:31:28.230 --> 02:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
under the uh current um work that you've
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
been doing on amendments to the fire
 
02:31:34.269 --> 02:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
code local authorities could still
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
require um that existing buildings with
 
02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
three three or four units have
 
02:31:42.469 --> 02:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
Sprinklers and what I'm wondering my
 
02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
question is uh would it be a good idea
 
02:31:51.150 --> 02:31:51.160 align:start position:0%
to um make some further Amendment to the
 
02:31:55.830 --> 02:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
state fire code uh so that uh local fire
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
officials could not require sprinklers
 
02:32:02.830 --> 02:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
in existing buildings with uh three or
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
four units so the battle will be the
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
local control discussion
 
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I think that's really the big thing
 
02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
right so I think from a consistency and
 
02:32:16.510 --> 02:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
application across the street that might
 
02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
be a goal um you know we've we've
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
supported the ability to make small
 
02:32:25.309 --> 02:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
local amendments as necessary uh it's I
 
02:32:27.190 --> 02:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
think the trouble is when people make
 
02:32:30.150 --> 02:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
huge amendments that are sort of against
 
02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
what the intent of you as a general
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
court do and and things like that that's
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
sort of when we wind up in this room
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
talking about these things but
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I I found that thoughtful lawfully
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
adopted local amendments make sense
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes um you know there's there's
 
02:32:53.030 --> 02:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
there's uh operational things I go back
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
to my conquer days like standardizing
 
02:32:58.349 --> 02:32:58.359 align:start position:0%
keys for alarm panels and and things
 
02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
like that that they come up that make it
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
from a functional and operational
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
perspective make sense we want uh key
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
box nox boxes in a certain location on
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
the building at the front entrance and
 
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
things like that that may differ from
 
02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester to conquer Nashville
 
02:33:14.670 --> 02:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
Portsmith or go up to Pittsburgh you
 
02:33:18.349 --> 02:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
know I think we need to allow them some
 
02:33:21.150 --> 02:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
flexibility but
 
02:33:26.150 --> 02:33:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's some work in uh house bill
 
02:33:27.389 --> 02:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
what's the
 
02:33:30.190 --> 02:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
one there's a house there's a bill no
 
02:33:31.590 --> 02:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's there's a bill being right now
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's trying to uh hone in a little bit
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
on the local Amendment stuff um
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a grance right now
 
02:33:41.040 --> 02:33:43.670 align:start position:0%
but I don't have a grance right now
representative

02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:33:46.590 --> 02:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
makoni thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
you Marshall again if I if I look at
 
02:33:52.750 --> 02:33:52.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation we have
 
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
1065 I don't know if you have a copy
 
02:33:58.910 --> 02:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
there line five or line four and I'm I
 
02:34:01.230 --> 02:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
just want your opinion of this it says
 
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
above that the state fire code
 
02:34:04.830 --> 02:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
Associated shall not require suppression
 
02:34:08.349 --> 02:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
or sprinkler systems in a detached one
 
02:34:11.150 --> 02:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
two family dwelling units in a structure
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
used only for residential purposes I'll
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
take you back to gorum we have uh we
 
02:34:19.110 --> 02:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
have buildings we have commercial
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
buildings that are no longer being used
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
that might perhaps take care of some of
 
02:34:26.750 --> 02:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
our residential purposes that building
 
02:34:29.389 --> 02:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
was never built built for a residential
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
purpose does that take it out of this or
 
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
that entire building was now to be used
 
02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:36.469 align:start position:0%
that entire building was now to be used
for

02:34:36.469 --> 02:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
residents what would you
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
say if there's a mix if there's a mix of
 
02:34:45.150 --> 02:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
commercial and residential the
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
commercial goes away commercial goes
 
02:34:48.670 --> 02:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
away and it's strictly residential it
 
02:34:50.110 --> 02:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
would be I would say that it would
 
02:34:52.830 --> 02:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
follow the existing building where we
 
02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
would not require the sprinklers as long
 
02:34:56.910 --> 02:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
as admit the existing uh apartment
 
02:35:00.190 --> 02:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
chapter is what we have is the amendment
 
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:08.349 --> 02:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
chair anyone else there's one more
 
02:35:11.349 --> 02:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
question uh representative Gibs thank
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
you um I've just been looking up uh in
 
02:35:19.630 --> 02:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
the leg lative uh search uh web page uh
 
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
for bills regarding local Authority um
 
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
and uh the closest thing that I found
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
was Senate Bill
 
02:35:31.150 --> 02:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
437 relative to local authority to amend
 
02:35:33.230 --> 02:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code was that what
 
02:35:35.269 --> 02:35:35.279 align:start position:0%
you were referring to before yes thank
 
02:35:36.469 --> 02:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
you and there's some language in there
 
02:35:37.910 --> 02:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
on the fire code sorry I couldn't
 
02:35:40.309 --> 02:35:40.319 align:start position:0%
remember the number that is the one so
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
you were talking about Senate Bill 437
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
and there was an amendment to that bill
 
02:35:46.750 --> 02:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
um I believe it passed Senate the other
 
02:35:48.990 --> 02:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate um Edna the other the other
 
02:35:50.670 --> 02:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
day that would cover the fire code as
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
well correct thank you you're
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
welcome anyone
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
else thank you Mr Fire Marshall thank
 
02:36:14.510 --> 02:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you Mr Mr chair members of
 
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:18.520 align:start position:0%
the committee uh my name is Phil Sherman
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the building code
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
review board uh for those who may not be
 
02:36:23.670 --> 02:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with us we write the state
 
02:36:26.429 --> 02:36:26.439 align:start position:0%
building code for ratification by the
 
02:36:29.190 --> 02:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislature uh based on conversations
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
with the State Fire Marshall
 
02:36:33.070 --> 02:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Damon and others uh the
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
bcrb has already approved amendments
 
02:36:37.309 --> 02:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
which actually go a little bit farther
 
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
than this bill uh and it would permit
 
02:36:43.790 --> 02:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
conversions from a nonresidential use to
 
02:36:45.670 --> 02:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
a residential use as long up to four
 
02:36:48.670 --> 02:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
years units without requiring Sprinklers
 
02:36:50.429 --> 02:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
and we also needed a second amendment
 
02:36:51.790 --> 02:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
because there is a route through the
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
existing building code where you might
 
02:36:55.870 --> 02:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
be required a sprinkler for major
 
02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
alterations so we've taken care of that
 
02:37:00.750 --> 02:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
as well um other sections of the bill
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
that talk about the specific technical
 
02:37:04.790 --> 02:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues are already covered by the fire
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
code and the existing building code so I
 
02:37:08.910 --> 02:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's a lot of need to
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
get into egress and fire barriers and
 
02:37:12.469 --> 02:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things have to comply
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
with them anyway um again as the fire
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
marshal uh indicated I I agree that
 
02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
writing specific code language into
 
02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
statute reduces the potential to deal
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
with specific conditions that come up no
 
02:37:29.670 --> 02:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
code can address every condition there's
 
02:37:32.070 --> 02:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
just too many different situations out
 
02:37:34.630 --> 02:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
there and our code and and through the
 
02:37:37.309 --> 02:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
fire code there are Provisions to to be
 
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
able to work with things for specific
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
conditions um lastly in terms of the
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
state level uh the concern of not having
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
this in statute but having it in the in
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
the Amendments remember that currently
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
our board can't do anything we we cannot
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
change the code one way or the other
 
02:37:58.510 --> 02:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
without it being ratified by the
 
02:38:00.950 --> 02:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislature so nothing can drop out of
 
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know at midnight and suddenly there
 
02:38:06.950 --> 02:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
it goes um I would talk speak for a
 
02:38:08.630 --> 02:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
minute about Municipal amendments we
 
02:38:10.150 --> 02:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
have to remember there's two different
 
02:38:11.910 --> 02:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
statutes that talk about one and two
 
02:38:14.269 --> 02:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
family dwellings one prohibits the state
 
02:38:16.429 --> 02:38:16.439 align:start position:0%
from writing a rule another prohibits
 
02:38:18.910 --> 02:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities from writing a rule I
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
think don't hold me to this I think it's
 
02:38:20.399 --> 02:38:21.150 align:start position:0%
think don't hold me to this I think it's
in

02:38:21.150 --> 02:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:38:23.950 --> 02:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
674 uh 51 or
 
02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:25.950 align:start position:0%
674 uh 51 or
thereabouts

02:38:25.950 --> 02:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
thereabouts
 
02:38:29.469 --> 02:38:29.479 align:start position:0%
um furthermore there are existing
 
02:38:32.070 --> 02:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal amendments out there that when
 
02:38:33.950 --> 02:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
the prohibition on one and two family
 
02:38:36.190 --> 02:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
sprinklers came in they were not
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
repealed so that that statute did not
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
invalidate old amendments that were
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
around before that so I'd suggest that
 
02:38:46.550 --> 02:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
if this does track through to a
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
municipal uh discussion be careful about
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
how some of those uh some of those
 
02:38:54.030 --> 02:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances may be written and I'm and
 
02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
again like the fire marshall said we've
 
02:38:58.030 --> 02:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
only got four municipalities that have
 
02:39:01.469 --> 02:39:01.479 align:start position:0%
sent these things to us for the website
 
02:39:04.429 --> 02:39:04.439 align:start position:0%
um we think about these four unit
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
buildings um and frequently the issue is
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
tow houses so the old you know two units
 
02:39:11.550 --> 02:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
upstairs two years downstairs they're
 
02:39:14.190 --> 02:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
very expensive to build these days and I
 
02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
I don't think we see all that many of
 
02:39:18.910 --> 02:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
being built anyway uh but town houses
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
are just modular and you build them
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
until you run out of land or the zoning
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
people say stop right or whatever you
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
parking maybe um so that's really one of
 
02:39:30.790 --> 02:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
the types of buildings that that goes in
 
02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
there those can be built under either of
 
02:39:34.910 --> 02:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
our codes there's a way to do it under
 
02:39:37.349 --> 02:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
the residential code so there a series
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
of single family dwellings there's
 
02:39:40.950 --> 02:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
another way to do it as a commercial
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
entity and again some of those Municipal
 
02:39:46.349 --> 02:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
amendments get into those uh those those
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
issues um I'd also caution us when we
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
02:39:53.389 --> 02:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
statistics we all know what
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
statisticians can do New Hampshire is a
 
02:39:58.510 --> 02:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
very small state Nationwide fire
 
02:40:03.550 --> 02:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
fatalities are 3500 a year perhaps 3,000
 
02:40:06.590 --> 02:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
plus so to shrink the statistical base
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
down to New Hampshire or the city of
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
conquered or this building just gives us
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
with a less accurate uh view of things
 
02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
um and that that's all I'll say about
 
02:40:19.990 --> 02:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and then lastly the bill talks
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
about existing residential buildings
 
02:40:24.269 --> 02:40:24.279 align:start position:0%
whereas our amendments talk about
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
existing buildings that are or become
 
02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
residential so you may want to look at
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
that wording I don't know how the
 
02:40:31.670 --> 02:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers and the Attorney General would
 
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
figure that out it may or may not be a
 
02:40:36.830 --> 02:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
problem and that being said I'm happy to
 
02:40:38.830 --> 02:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you Mr Sherman
 
02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
other questions representa coni thank
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
you uh Mr chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
to take the question um when when your
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
group brings these amendments forward
 
02:40:52.510 --> 02:40:52.520 align:start position:0%
for legislature review do they come as
 
02:40:55.030 --> 02:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
individual amendments or do they come as
 
02:40:57.030 --> 02:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate likes to give us a pile at
 
02:41:00.150 --> 02:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
one time and get passed are they
 
02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
individual so we have uh in in this
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
cycle we're up we're proposing updating
 
02:41:09.550 --> 02:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
six of the eight codes that are included
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
in the State Building Code the National
 
02:41:13.710 --> 02:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
Electric Code is on a different cycle
 
02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
because it's published by a different
 
02:41:17.110 --> 02:41:17.120 align:start position:0%
entity we be back next year with that
 
02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the energy code as some of you may
 
02:41:21.389 --> 02:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
know we're proposing leaving where it is
 
02:41:23.790 --> 02:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
it may through Amendment wind up going
 
02:41:26.830 --> 02:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
to the newer Edition there uh with those
 
02:41:30.190 --> 02:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
six codes we have 79 amendments many of
 
02:41:32.190 --> 02:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
them are administrative we just need to
 
02:41:33.710 --> 02:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
say this is the New Hampshire State
 
02:41:35.870 --> 02:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
Building Code that kind of stuff some of
 
02:41:38.990 --> 02:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
them are technical uh I believe 15 of
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
them are new amendments heavily to deal
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
with this issue recovery housing or
 
02:41:46.389 --> 02:41:46.399 align:start position:0%
recovery homes which was a big big thing
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
bubbling around this year and we picked
 
02:41:51.550 --> 02:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
up a bunch of other stuff some to bring
 
02:41:53.389 --> 02:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
the building code into compliance with
 
02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:55.640 align:start position:0%
some regulations that the governor's
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
Commission on disability already had
 
02:42:00.349 --> 02:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
this was just trying to align things and
 
02:42:01.750 --> 02:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
make it easier for
 
02:42:04.870 --> 02:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
everybody all of that gets packaged up
 
02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
and then there's a date in the RSA that
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
says approved by the building code
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
review board through this date and then
 
02:42:14.349 --> 02:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
we shift that date which is is happening
 
02:42:18.590 --> 02:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
now go ahead thank you so it's it's
 
02:42:21.309 --> 02:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
voted on as an entire package
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
so it it all has to be approved you
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
there aren't individual pieces that come
 
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:29.950 align:start position:0%
there aren't individual pieces that come
through

02:42:29.950 --> 02:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:42:33.750 --> 02:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
so what we did last year the EPA changed
 
02:42:35.510 --> 02:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
their rules on refrigeration and we
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
wound up with the need for a batch of
 
02:42:39.950 --> 02:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
amendments that actually leap to LEAP to
 
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
a code that wasn't published yet to
 
02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
bring it into account with what the feds
 
02:42:46.429 --> 02:42:46.439 align:start position:0%
were telling us we had to do do anyway
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
all we said to the to the legislature
 
02:42:50.950 --> 02:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
was sit tight let us go back approve
 
02:42:52.750 --> 02:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
these amendments and then we change the
 
02:42:55.790 --> 02:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
date out to I think it was in May so it
 
02:42:58.230 --> 02:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
was that easy and we're not clogging up
 
02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
the statute with the details of these
 
02:43:03.469 --> 02:43:03.479 align:start position:0%
amendments thank you so so let me add a
 
02:43:08.190 --> 02:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
a question on that yes or no does each
 
02:43:11.070 --> 02:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
code Amendment get voted up or down by
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
the legislature or is it voted on as a
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:15.990 align:start position:0%
the legislature or is it voted on as a
package

02:43:15.990 --> 02:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
package
 
02:43:18.790 --> 02:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
unless somebody changes it it's V it was
 
02:43:21.510 --> 02:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
voted on as a package last year this
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
bill is intended to be voted on as a
 
02:43:25.150 --> 02:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
package but bills changed does the
 
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
legislature have the ability to reject
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
part of it and not all of it or approve
 
02:43:33.870 --> 02:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
all of it not and part of it right um
 
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
let's say that line out of veto
 
02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
that I I want to use a term but but it's
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
probably not the right term a bully
 
02:43:45.469 --> 02:43:45.479 align:start position:0%
pulpit right so if there was an you know
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
a pretty cohesive instruction to us that
 
02:43:51.230 --> 02:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment ought to go away what I
 
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
would say as the chair is give us a
 
02:43:54.790 --> 02:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
couple months we'll take it back we'll
 
02:43:56.349 --> 02:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
go through the process we'll get rid of
 
02:43:58.990 --> 02:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
it come back to you with a clean bill
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
the other way it could happen and I
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
think it's happened in the past is you
 
02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
know we have a code number for each
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we start writing that
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
stuff into you know except for this
 
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that might be necessary if
 
02:44:14.349 --> 02:44:14.359 align:start position:0%
this issue came up late in the day you
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
know I toward the end of the session
 
02:44:23.110 --> 02:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:25.630 --> 02:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
question okay any other questions from
 
02:44:25.640 --> 02:44:26.510 align:start position:0%
question okay any other questions from
Mr

02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:44:29.150 --> 02:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
Sherman repres represent De Lorenzo
 
02:44:30.790 --> 02:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:44:35.150 --> 02:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
my question so looking at um the
 
02:44:40.429 --> 02:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
building code for a 304 unit
 
02:44:43.790 --> 02:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
building if there's a garage under in
 
02:44:46.030 --> 02:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
the building does that
 
02:44:47.870 --> 02:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
require more
 
02:44:50.510 --> 02:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
sprinkers no the only real impact of a
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
garage is a piece of sheetrock and a
 
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
door which matters whether it's under or
 
02:44:59.190 --> 02:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
next to thank you
 
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:01.640 align:start position:0%
yeah seeing none thank you Mr Sherman
 
02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:03.880 align:start position:0%

welcome I can never I got it right this

welcome I can never I got it right this
time

02:45:16.590 --> 02:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
good yep still morning good morning
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
represent Alexander and members of the
 
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Bill mckenny I'm president
 
02:45:24.429 --> 02:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
of the Hamshire building officials
 
02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
Association and I'm here to um just
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit about our concerns
 
02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
with this bill um the building officials
 
02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:36.920 align:start position:0%
uh tend not to support um code
 
02:45:38.790 --> 02:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
amendments through the building of fire
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
codes be put in legislation um as far as
 
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
becoming law makes it very difficult to
 
02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
amend those later and we've had some
 
02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
instances in past and I would bring up
 
02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
the case of RSA 155d which caused a lot
 
02:45:55.309 --> 02:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
of conflicts in the state and it took us
 
02:45:57.630 --> 02:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
about four years to have that amended
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
out and repealed um in order to resolve
 
02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:02.550 align:start position:0%
out and repealed um in order to resolve
those

02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
conflicts so our concern here is that we
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
really believe amendments to the
 
02:46:09.269 --> 02:46:09.279 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes should go
 
02:46:11.230 --> 02:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
through the process that's been adopted
 
02:46:14.790 --> 02:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
now and continues to be improved upon as
 
02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
you know they've put in a new
 
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislative committee um that the bcrb
 
02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:21.279 align:start position:0%
uh sends their their information to
 
02:46:24.030 --> 02:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
their amendments to it's reviewed there
 
02:46:25.309 --> 02:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's moved through committee and then
 
02:46:27.070 --> 02:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
moved on to the legislature that's a
 
02:46:29.070 --> 02:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
fairly new process and I think it's
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
really important that we spend some time
 
02:46:32.349 --> 02:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
and to see how that's going to that's
 
02:46:36.070 --> 02:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
going to play out um we really do not
 
02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
support code amendments being put in in
 
02:46:43.429 --> 02:46:43.439 align:start position:0%
is individual parts of the legislation
 
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll take any questions
 
02:46:46.790 --> 02:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
02:46:49.469 --> 02:46:49.479 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
02:46:52.429 --> 02:46:52.439 align:start position:0%
mckin representative
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you for taking my question
 
02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
independent of your statement
 
02:47:00.349 --> 02:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
about uh not supporting code amendments
 
02:47:00.359 --> 02:47:01.710 align:start position:0%
about uh not supporting code amendments
in

02:47:01.710 --> 02:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
law do you or your organization have an
 
02:47:08.469 --> 02:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
opinion on the concept that's in this
 
02:47:08.479 --> 02:47:10.150 align:start position:0%
opinion on the concept that's in this
proposed

02:47:10.150 --> 02:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
02:47:13.230 --> 02:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
law yes uh nhoa did work with the
 
02:47:15.750 --> 02:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee over the summer um in order to
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
look to look at this uh uh possibility
 
02:47:20.830 --> 02:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
of moving to no sprinklers in in four
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
units or less um and provided that the
 
02:47:26.070 --> 02:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
other conditions are met you know proper
 
02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
fire separation egress emergency escape
 
02:47:30.550 --> 02:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know ear early warning devices
 
02:47:33.309 --> 02:47:33.319 align:start position:0%
through smoke detection um we sub we
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
have no uh objection to this and you
 
02:47:38.110 --> 02:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you if you ask
 
02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
anybody how how it came to three units
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
needing sprinklers I think it's because
 
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's the commercial code right when
 
02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
once you go to three units or more you
 
02:47:47.590 --> 02:47:47.600 align:start position:0%
move out of the residential code and you
 
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
get end up in the in the commercial code
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
so now we're in the commercial code
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
let's sprinkle it so thank
 
02:47:57.150 --> 02:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no other questions thank
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
02:48:00.750 --> 02:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
much all right so the committee would
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
Mor thank you Mr chairman members of a
 
02:48:10.389 --> 02:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Greg
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
Moore I'm a regional director for
 
02:48:13.469 --> 02:48:13.479 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here today to
 
02:48:16.110 --> 02:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this legis ation
 
02:48:19.309 --> 02:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I'll start at the very high level the
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
reason for this committee's existence is
 
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
because we have a housing crisis in New
 
02:48:24.150 --> 02:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we need to find a way to
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
develop more inventory for the state one
 
02:48:28.190 --> 02:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
of the barriers to creating more
 
02:48:31.670 --> 02:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
inventory are the capital costs zoning
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
zoning and planning are definitely one
 
02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
one barrier but another barrier is is a
 
02:48:37.510 --> 02:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
capital cost making conversions that
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
create more
 
02:48:41.349 --> 02:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
inventory this is a a this legislation
 
02:48:43.790 --> 02:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
is a good step in terms of reducing that
 
02:48:46.190 --> 02:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
Capital cost to create more inventory
 
02:48:47.469 --> 02:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
for housing in the state of New
 
02:48:49.590 --> 02:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to speak a little
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
bit about um some of the the technical
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
about about putting the building code in
 
02:48:56.910 --> 02:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
in the statute the building code is in
 
02:48:59.190 --> 02:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
the statute it's just Incorporated by
 
02:49:01.910 --> 02:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
reference and what that means is what
 
02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
that means is for those folks who don't
 
02:49:06.030 --> 02:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
serve on on the Edna committee means you
 
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
vote on it you and you blindly accept
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
whatever a a third party organization
 
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
decides is the right the right thing for
 
02:49:15.269 --> 02:49:15.279 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and it often
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
gets pushed that way because uh the
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
insurers like to see one uniform set of
 
02:49:22.750 --> 02:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
regulations across all but that doesn't
 
02:49:24.590 --> 02:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
mean it's the right policy for the State
 
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and uh and so this step
 
02:49:31.830 --> 02:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
I think is an an important one in terms
 
02:49:34.630 --> 02:49:34.640 align:start position:0%
of uh having a very specific goal in
 
02:49:38.349 --> 02:49:38.359 align:start position:0%
terms of allowing units of up to four uh
 
02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:40.279 align:start position:0%
four units to be able to have this
 
02:49:41.750 --> 02:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
without this additional Capital cost
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
would be required to do an existing
 
02:49:45.790 --> 02:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
conversion totally make sense for new
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
new construction it's not a b it's not
 
02:49:50.030 --> 02:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
as big a burden for new construction for
 
02:49:51.990 --> 02:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
existing it is a big burden to try to
 
02:49:53.590 --> 02:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
make this this
 
02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
conversion and the only thing that I
 
02:49:59.229 --> 02:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
would say specific because you have Eda
 
02:50:01.389 --> 02:50:01.399 align:start position:0%
passing these uh building code
 
02:50:04.750 --> 02:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
regulations specific to remove conflict
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
the only thing that I would add is at
 
02:50:08.830 --> 02:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this this uh paragraph
 
02:50:10.910 --> 02:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
I would add non withstanding any other
 
02:50:13.550 --> 02:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
provision of law to the contrary so it's
 
02:50:15.550 --> 02:50:15.560 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear what the policy is it's
 
02:50:18.429 --> 02:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
being set by the legislature and you're
 
02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
not creating a conflict between this
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
section of Law and potentially another
 
02:50:24.550 --> 02:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
section of law that is potentially just
 
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
Incorporated by reference and finally
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
the last point I would make is uh
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the Senate Bill coming
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
forward part of the challenges is that
 
02:50:35.469 --> 02:50:35.479 align:start position:0%
that bill will go to will go undoubtedly
 
02:50:36.990 --> 02:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
go to the Edna committee it will not
 
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
come before this committee and so you
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
then have two committees working
 
02:50:44.269 --> 02:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
potentially cross purposes and I think
 
02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
that that this is a clear statement of
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
policy by this committee uh which is
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
based upon the reason why this committee
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
was set up to exist in the first place
 
02:50:54.269 --> 02:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
so I think it's an important step to
 
02:50:56.269 --> 02:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
move forward with this and considering
 
02:50:57.870 --> 02:50:57.880 align:start position:0%
how far behind I'll stop talking and
 
02:51:00.070 --> 02:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
take any questions you might have thank
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony are there any
 
02:51:03.590 --> 02:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify uh before us today
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that you support this
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation but Al so this proposed
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislation but also um that the
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
building codes are uh Incorporated in
 
02:51:25.469 --> 02:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
statute by reference which of course I
 
02:51:28.590 --> 02:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
understand uh is there any reason um
 
02:51:32.590 --> 02:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
that you would argue that it's better to
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh provide for existing buildings with
 
02:51:38.349 --> 02:51:38.359 align:start position:0%
three or four units not being required
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
to have sprinklers is there any reason
 
02:51:43.110 --> 02:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
that it's better to do that by Statute
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
than by revising the building code which
 
02:51:49.349 --> 02:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
is a comprehensive uh building and fire
 
02:51:52.389 --> 02:51:52.399 align:start position:0%
codes which are comprehensive statements
 
02:51:55.910 --> 02:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
um of the requirements for uh those
 
02:51:58.710 --> 02:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
doing the conversions and therefore are
 
02:52:01.870 --> 02:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
at least relatively easy to find uh and
 
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
as you pointed out are also Incorporated
 
02:52:07.349 --> 02:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the statute by reference thank you
 
02:52:08.910 --> 02:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
for the question I apologize I have this
 
02:52:12.510 --> 02:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
giant speaker in front of me so uh I
 
02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
think that it's up to the legislature to
 
02:52:17.229 --> 02:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
br side policy
 
02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh Sor sorry could you speak into uh yes
 
02:52:22.150 --> 02:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's important for the
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to set policy and we
 
02:52:27.469 --> 02:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
understand what the Dynamics are at play
 
02:52:30.710 --> 02:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of of a specific policy of
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
trying to create more more housing
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
inventory and uh and this is a bill that
 
02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:38.279 align:start position:0%
allows for the creation of housing
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
inventory without an additional Capital
 
02:52:42.429 --> 02:52:42.439 align:start position:0%
cost a significant additional Capital
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
cost so I I think it's it's it's from
 
02:52:47.790 --> 02:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature's
 
02:52:50.550 --> 02:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
perspective uh again and again I used to
 
02:52:52.750 --> 02:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
work for the house so I I and and I used
 
02:52:54.990 --> 02:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
to work for for for a state agency so I
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
understand the Dynamics between the two
 
02:52:59.269 --> 02:52:59.279 align:start position:0%
it's certainly more convenient for a
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
number of the executive
 
02:53:03.309 --> 02:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
agencies uh it's more convenient for a
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
number of the executive agencies to have
 
02:53:09.150 --> 02:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh sort of these comprehensive codes but
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day from a
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
policymaking perspective uh it's up to
 
02:53:15.309 --> 02:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
legislature to set that clear Direction
 
02:53:17.950 --> 02:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what this legislation
 
02:53:20.950 --> 02:53:20.960 align:start position:0%
does representa yella thank you thank
 
02:53:24.190 --> 02:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question um do you
 
02:53:27.630 --> 02:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
have any concerns um that seem to have
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
been brought up by previous speaker that
 
02:53:34.990 --> 02:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
the restriction on this legislation is
 
02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
just indicating that the state fire
 
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
codes um and Associated roles shall not
 
02:53:45.229 --> 02:53:45.239 align:start position:0%
require um and not that
 
02:53:47.790 --> 02:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
that is essentially silent on the
 
02:53:52.790 --> 02:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
municipal power to amend that um in
 
02:53:54.429 --> 02:53:54.439 align:start position:0%
possibly a different section of law that
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
they're that they have that power in in
 
02:54:00.830 --> 02:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
essentially neutering the the value of
 
02:54:03.389 --> 02:54:03.399 align:start position:0%
this legislation are you concerned about
 
02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
that well representative thanks for the
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
question uh I would say that if you put
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
non withstanding any other provision of
 
02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
law to the contrary you would solve that
 
02:54:14.790 --> 02:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
problem okay thank you okay
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
thanks next up I will call on The
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:33.389 --> 02:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
van good morning chairman and committee
 
02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh I would like to
 
02:54:39.870 --> 02:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
urge you to not do anything with this
 
02:54:42.590 --> 02:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill we don't need this bill I was
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
actually the person who called Sean T me
 
02:54:47.190 --> 02:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
18 months ago and started this
 
02:54:49.389 --> 02:54:49.399 align:start position:0%
conversation about not requiring
 
02:54:52.870 --> 02:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
sprinklers for four or fewer units lots
 
02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
of other states have done it I just
 
02:54:57.389 --> 02:54:57.399 align:start position:0%
found out yesterday that Montana did it
 
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
and um particularly in a retrofit it's a
 
02:55:03.670 --> 02:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money it does not
 
02:55:05.910 --> 02:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
increase safety appreciably there are
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
better places to put our safety money
 
02:55:10.349 --> 02:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
that's the big that's the meat of the
 
02:55:13.030 --> 02:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
testimony but the real thing is we don't
 
02:55:14.790 --> 02:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
need it because we actually don't want
 
02:55:18.469 --> 02:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
to handle things like this in statute as
 
02:55:21.389 --> 02:55:21.399 align:start position:0%
Sean said when I went and talked to him
 
02:55:23.309 --> 02:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
about this he said we actually don't
 
02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
want to do this in statute we have a
 
02:55:29.349 --> 02:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
method and a place to deal with code
 
02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
issues let's do it through the code and
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's what's happened it's as you have
 
02:55:37.510 --> 02:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
already heard from everyone else it's
 
02:55:39.309 --> 02:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
passed through Senate it's Senate I
 
02:55:41.950 --> 02:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
think it's Senate Bill 599 it's on the
 
02:55:43.750 --> 02:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
consent calendar it's going to come to
 
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
the house
 
02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
we should vote for it and it will be in
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
the right place and we will have solved
 
02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
the issue so I think we should stop
 
02:55:55.630 --> 02:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
talking about this and move on to some
 
02:55:57.830 --> 02:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
of those other fascinating bills coming
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
before us thank you so much for your
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
time and attention yes I will answer a
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
question if you have one
 
02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
representative thank you um thank you
 
02:56:11.110 --> 02:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
for your perspective um
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
what do you think about the issue raised
 
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
about the the local um Power Municipal
 
02:56:21.269 --> 02:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
Power to essentially
 
02:56:25.389 --> 02:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
um still have this rule in place even
 
02:56:27.790 --> 02:56:27.800 align:start position:0%
after the code is adopted I think that
 
02:56:30.830 --> 02:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
that is a red herring I don't think it's
 
02:56:33.349 --> 02:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
likely to happen um I've been living in
 
02:56:35.150 --> 02:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire for 40 years
 
02:56:36.750 --> 02:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
I've been involved in local government
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
for most of those years and as you know
 
02:56:40.550 --> 02:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
I'm a professional land use planner
 
02:56:41.870 --> 02:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
these are the kind of things we talk
 
02:56:45.429 --> 02:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
about I don't and and changing the code
 
02:56:47.349 --> 02:56:47.359 align:start position:0%
at the local level while it is possible
 
02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
to do is not an easy lift I can't see a
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
local a local code official saying you
 
02:56:57.710 --> 02:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
know what we need to do this I I just
 
02:57:00.349 --> 02:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
don't see it happening I and I do think
 
02:57:03.070 --> 02:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
there's a huge problem in having things
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
in various places my husband who's a
 
02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
computer specialist says that if you
 
02:57:09.550 --> 02:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
write if if you put the answer to a
 
02:57:11.030 --> 02:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing in two different places it's going
 
02:57:13.750 --> 02:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
to be wrong in one of them and I think
 
02:57:16.830 --> 02:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
that that's a danger of trying to do
 
02:57:18.750 --> 02:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
this through statute rather than through
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
code which is where it should live so I
 
02:57:24.510 --> 02:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't see the the problem of a local
 
02:57:27.309 --> 02:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
community saying oh let's do this as
 
02:57:30.429 --> 02:57:30.439 align:start position:0%
being a thing that we should be spending
 
02:57:32.750 --> 02:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
time and energy on I really don't I
 
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
think we should let it stay in the in
 
02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:40.120 align:start position:0%
the code where it already is and leave
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
it there
 
02:57:43.990 --> 02:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your time
 
02:57:47.349 --> 02:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much for having
 
02:57:50.190 --> 02:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
me you have a question thank you for
 
02:57:52.030 --> 02:57:52.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question would it not make
 
02:57:53.950 --> 02:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
sense then maybe to amend this and have
 
02:57:57.070 --> 02:57:57.080 align:start position:0%
a uh a Statewide prohibition such that
 
02:57:59.710 --> 02:57:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh no local um political subdivision can
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
make any greater restrictions that are
 
02:58:03.389 --> 02:58:03.399 align:start position:0%
currently in existence in the code you
 
02:58:05.229 --> 02:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
can do that if you want to I don't know
 
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
that I think it's necessary but you
 
02:58:09.710 --> 02:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
certainly could do that what I am
 
02:58:12.590 --> 02:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about is that we we've now
 
02:58:14.429 --> 02:58:14.439 align:start position:0%
spent almost an hour going down these
 
02:58:17.070 --> 02:58:17.080 align:start position:0%
various rabbit holes I'm worried that
 
02:58:21.950 --> 02:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
this very useful piece of of code is
 
02:58:25.309 --> 02:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
going to be strangled on the way to the
 
02:58:29.190 --> 02:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
house floor so if you wanted to make
 
02:58:31.750 --> 02:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
that change you certainly could I don't
 
02:58:34.110 --> 02:58:34.120 align:start position:0%
know that I think it's necessary because
 
02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
of what I just said I I haven't seen a
 
02:58:39.750 --> 02:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
lot of local jurisdic I only know of two
 
02:58:42.309 --> 02:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
that have made a change to the codes one
 
02:58:44.469 --> 02:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
of them is the Durham energy and the
 
02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
other one when I said conquered and I
 
02:58:48.030 --> 02:58:48.040 align:start position:0%
can't remember what it is those are the
 
02:58:50.469 --> 02:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
only two ones I know about and I I just
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
don't see in our small towns that that's
 
02:58:55.150 --> 02:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
going to or even our bigger towns or
 
02:58:57.389 --> 02:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
cities that that's going to be a huge
 
02:58:59.870 --> 02:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
issue I think there's better energy
 
02:59:02.030 --> 02:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
places okay thank
 
02:59:05.429 --> 02:59:05.439 align:start position:0%
you um so just we are running behind so
 
02:59:07.550 --> 02:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'm going to power through lunch um
 
02:59:08.830 --> 02:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
we'll plug away if there's members of
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
the committee that need to step away
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
that is um quite okay so um with that
 
02:59:25.750 --> 02:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:28.469 --> 02:59:28.479 align:start position:0%
Fredericks good morning um I am M
 
02:59:31.950 --> 02:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
friedricks from Durham New Hampshire um
 
02:59:34.590 --> 02:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
and I use the pronouns uh Zer and the
 
02:59:38.910 --> 02:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
title mix um and I am here representing
 
02:59:41.670 --> 02:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
myself today uh thank you very much for
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
hearing my testimony um but I do also
 
02:59:47.070 --> 02:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
want to share that I serve on the Town
 
02:59:49.269 --> 02:59:49.279 align:start position:0%
Council um as an elected official in
 
02:59:52.229 --> 02:59:52.239 align:start position:0%
Durham um and because of that have been
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
involved in navigating um Durham's
 
02:59:58.389 --> 02:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
sprinkler code so Durham um actually has
 
03:00:01.150 --> 03:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
a a little bit stricter sprinkler code
 
03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
than the current um State one we re
 
03:00:06.750 --> 03:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
require existing buildings to be
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
sprinkled as well and that is because of
 
03:00:11.550 --> 03:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
um the number of student apartment
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
buildings that we have in town um
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes as many as 14 to 16 units
 
03:00:20.309 --> 03:00:20.319 align:start position:0%
housed in sometimes old colonial homes
 
03:00:23.830 --> 03:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
historic buildings wood um that
 
03:00:28.389 --> 03:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
represent um or that our our um our fire
 
03:00:30.469 --> 03:00:30.479 align:start position:0%
department has deemed to be a rather
 
03:00:33.030 --> 03:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
exceptional fire risk to have you know
 
03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
20 plus 30 so college students living in
 
03:00:39.670 --> 03:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
a wooden Colonial building um with none
 
03:00:43.389 --> 03:00:43.399 align:start position:0%
of the modern fire standards um that
 
03:00:43.399 --> 03:00:44.510 align:start position:0%
of the modern fire standards um that
said

03:00:44.510 --> 03:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
um we have also recognized and our Fire
 
03:00:49.590 --> 03:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
Marshall has recognized that we need to
 
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
treat buildings with um three or four
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
units differently than these larger
 
03:00:59.349 --> 03:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
buildings um and so um that that that is
 
03:01:01.630 --> 03:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
why I'm here speaking um for myself
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
today um I wanted to share a little bit
 
03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
uh of a personal story around this so um
 
03:01:10.389 --> 03:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
my sibling in Providence Rhode Island um
 
03:01:13.710 --> 03:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
bought a two family um again his
 
03:01:16.710 --> 03:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
historic home that He restored um and
 
03:01:19.269 --> 03:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
he's been trying to to add a third unit
 
03:01:22.750 --> 03:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
to that um he's owned this property and
 
03:01:24.910 --> 03:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
been working on it for probably 5 years
 
03:01:28.190 --> 03:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
now um and he was unable to do the third
 
03:01:30.190 --> 03:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
unit for most of that time because it
 
03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
would require um spending more than a
 
03:01:35.309 --> 03:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
$30,000 on just the sprinkler system and
 
03:01:37.389 --> 03:01:37.399 align:start position:0%
that's being on public water and we know
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
of course that in New Hampshire a lot of
 
03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
lots are not on public water and so they
 
03:01:44.229 --> 03:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
have much more expensive install ation
 
03:01:48.750 --> 03:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
costs um eventually he was able um to
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
receive a a variance to do that third
 
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
unit in part because the historic home
 
03:01:56.710 --> 03:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
had had an apartment back in the 1930s
 
03:01:59.429 --> 03:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
in that third space but um and that is
 
03:02:02.309 --> 03:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
the unit that he and his um now wife and
 
03:02:05.110 --> 03:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
young baby will be moving into now if
 
03:02:06.750 --> 03:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
they had not been able to do that that
 
03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
would be um an entire unit of housing
 
03:02:11.469 --> 03:02:11.479 align:start position:0%
that would be lost there um that
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been able to been to be
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
created um our own story um you know we
 
03:02:21.190 --> 03:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh created an Adu in our home to help us
 
03:02:22.870 --> 03:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
afford our home we would not be able to
 
03:02:24.750 --> 03:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
afford our mortgage and property taxes
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
without it um we have more space than we
 
03:02:31.150 --> 03:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
need and that is still true um and we
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
get messages in our neighborhood
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
Facebook group from grad students who
 
03:02:37.950 --> 03:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
can only afford $800 a month in rent and
 
03:02:41.429 --> 03:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
can't find a place to live in Durham we
 
03:02:43.630 --> 03:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
could create that housing and our
 
03:02:46.469 --> 03:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
finished basement in our existing space
 
03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
if this bill were to pass um along with
 
03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
the second Adu unit bill um HB
 
03:02:58.670 --> 03:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
1291 um the house you know the house
 
03:03:00.750 --> 03:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
average household sizes in New Hampshire
 
03:03:02.510 --> 03:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
are shrinking considerably I think our
 
03:03:05.710 --> 03:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
average is at like 2.3 people Which is
 
03:03:09.590 --> 03:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
far below what it was um se you know a
 
03:03:12.190 --> 03:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
couple decades back and so looking at
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
our particular example this is a home
 
03:03:16.950 --> 03:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
that is a square footage of under 2200
 
03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
ft the occupancy if we were to have a
 
03:03:22.429 --> 03:03:22.439 align:start position:0%
third unit would be 5 to six people so
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's really comparable to a pretty
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
standard single family residence um and
 
03:03:30.469 --> 03:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
so I think that it makes a lot and how
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
large is the square footage of this
 
03:03:32.040 --> 03:03:32.950 align:start position:0%
large is the square footage of this
building

03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
altogether um and the reason I think
 
03:03:38.110 --> 03:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
that it may make sense to to consider
 
03:03:41.590 --> 03:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
this as a bill still is that um you know
 
03:03:43.910 --> 03:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
Durham is one of the municipalities that
 
03:03:47.389 --> 03:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
um has uh exercised local right to
 
03:03:49.229 --> 03:03:49.239 align:start position:0%
expand upon its code and do stretch
 
03:03:50.830 --> 03:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
codes and there have been very good
 
03:03:53.590 --> 03:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
reasons to do that at times um we have
 
03:03:55.950 --> 03:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
concern about you know some some
 
03:03:58.630 --> 03:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
existing multi-unit buildings that were
 
03:04:00.550 --> 03:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
not sprinkler and that were Exempted
 
03:04:02.590 --> 03:04:02.600 align:start position:0%
under the current state code and that
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
really were very serious fire risks um
 
03:04:08.830 --> 03:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before and um and had
 
03:04:11.670 --> 03:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
past fires um and in the 1970s had
 
03:04:13.550 --> 03:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
people die in Durham in those fires and
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
so there were good reasons for having
 
03:04:17.670 --> 03:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
those stretch codes we also have a
 
03:04:20.670 --> 03:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
stretch code in our energy code um and
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
we really value that as a community and
 
03:04:25.870 --> 03:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
in fact we we've had you know developers
 
03:04:27.630 --> 03:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
have had concerns about the increased
 
03:04:29.830 --> 03:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
cost of that those same developers have
 
03:04:31.830 --> 03:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
come back repeatedly to the town and
 
03:04:34.710 --> 03:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
said it was a really good stretch code
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
because in five years I have more than
 
03:04:41.110 --> 03:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
made up the money that I had to expend
 
03:04:43.030 --> 03:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
additionally for those energy costs and
 
03:04:46.190 --> 03:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
so it's ultimately creating cost savings
 
03:04:48.309 --> 03:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
and and driving down the cost of housing
 
03:04:51.950 --> 03:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
in Durham and I think that you know
 
03:04:54.670 --> 03:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
having some local control enables
 
03:04:58.469 --> 03:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities to where appropriate try
 
03:05:00.670 --> 03:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
out different things see if they make
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
sense see if they work at a smaller
 
03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
scale before committing the entire state
 
03:05:08.110 --> 03:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
to something um and then that's why you
 
03:05:10.830 --> 03:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
know in other zoning conversations we'
 
03:05:13.349 --> 03:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
we've talked about why you know if you
 
03:05:16.070 --> 03:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
try something at in one local level and
 
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work well you've made a
 
03:05:20.550 --> 03:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
mistake in that small area and it's the
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
impact will be minimal and you can more
 
03:05:24.670 --> 03:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
easily you know reel that back but if
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
you've committed the entire State down a
 
03:05:28.630 --> 03:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
path then that's much harder and it's
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
much harder to kind of figure out what
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
is the best next thing for New Hampshire
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
and so um I am very wary of uh removing
 
03:05:39.469 --> 03:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
local um control when it comes to being
 
03:05:41.950 --> 03:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
able to do stretch ordinances but I
 
03:05:43.269 --> 03:05:43.279 align:start position:0%
think that there are appropriate situ
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
situations where um the state may need
 
03:05:48.389 --> 03:05:48.399 align:start position:0%
to step in and and clarify um
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
particularly given the housing crisis um
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
what really makes makes sense so thank
 
03:05:56.190 --> 03:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for your
 
03:05:57.670 --> 03:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
 
03:06:00.389 --> 03:06:00.399 align:start position:0%
represent y Kell thank you the previous
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
speaker to talked about how this this uh
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
was not going to be uh ATT tackled by
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
local municipality so I'm definitely
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
interested um in this uh
 
03:06:16.550 --> 03:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
that that you guys actually did address
 
03:06:22.070 --> 03:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
this locally um I guess if you know
 
03:06:28.190 --> 03:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
uh does that local uh stretch code um
 
03:06:32.910 --> 03:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
address the three and four unit
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
um requirement and does it require it
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
and and and just in general could you if
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
you have it readily available can you
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
send that code to the committee uh that
 
03:06:48.229 --> 03:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
stretch code to the committee so that we
 
03:06:52.229 --> 03:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
can peruse it at our you know ample time
 
03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
sure I'd be happy to um to send that to
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
the committee and um currently Durham's
 
03:07:01.309 --> 03:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
ordinance does require um sprinkling for
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
all um all buildings with three or more
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
units and we have recognized and Durham
 
03:07:09.309 --> 03:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
that that is
 
03:07:12.269 --> 03:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
problematic um and so we are working to
 
03:07:14.389 --> 03:07:14.399 align:start position:0%
adjust that and change that and the
 
03:07:16.550 --> 03:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
thought is the guidance um from our Fire
 
03:07:19.269 --> 03:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
Marshall is that um he would like to
 
03:07:19.279 --> 03:07:20.950 align:start position:0%
Marshall is that um he would like to
that

03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:07:23.510 --> 03:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
code but happy to share
 
03:07:27.070 --> 03:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
that okay can you briefly elaborate on
 
03:07:29.070 --> 03:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
what a stretch code a stretch ordinance
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
is sure um I'm not sure if that's a
 
03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
official terminology it's what we um you
 
03:07:37.590 --> 03:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
know what I've heard used uh around
 
03:07:40.790 --> 03:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
Durham in terms of town government um so
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
we have um a couple places in which our
 
03:07:45.790 --> 03:07:45.800 align:start position:0%
building code is more stringent than the
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire um the sprinkler
 
03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
ordinance is not actually adopted as
 
03:07:53.469 --> 03:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
building code is adopted as a town order
 
03:07:56.190 --> 03:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
heating cost throughout the winter um
 
03:07:57.309 --> 03:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
and and I know that our Town
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
Administrator submitted um a letter to
 
03:08:01.469 --> 03:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
that committee about that and provided
 
03:08:05.030 --> 03:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
some economic information about um about
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
why that bill was there not that bill
 
03:08:09.150 --> 03:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
but that um that code was adopted in
 
03:08:13.389 --> 03:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
Durham okay thank you see question thank
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you I'll
 
03:08:17.950 --> 03:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
now call Ben Frost would you like to
 
03:08:17.960 --> 03:08:29.469 align:start position:0%
now call Ben Frost would you like to
testify

03:08:29.469 --> 03:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:32.750 --> 03:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman uh Ben Frost
 
03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
Deputy executive director and chief
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
legal officer for New Hampshire housing
 
03:08:37.950 --> 03:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
the pink card says Rob dapas he had to
 
03:08:40.110 --> 03:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
step away I'll put in a new pink card
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
under my name um
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh enduring a a long
 
03:08:51.190 --> 03:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
morning it is now afternoon uh we're
 
03:08:53.229 --> 03:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
right there with you uh New Hampshire
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
housing is strongly in support of the
 
03:08:57.710 --> 03:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
idea of this legislation we understand
 
03:09:01.429 --> 03:09:01.439 align:start position:0%
the debate currently going on uh among
 
03:09:03.150 --> 03:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
the committee and and Witnesses
 
03:09:04.870 --> 03:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
testifying about whether it's a good
 
03:09:07.990 --> 03:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
idea to put it into statute this code
 
03:09:10.389 --> 03:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
change or to rely on the revisions to
 
03:09:12.349 --> 03:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
the code frankly we're we're a bit
 
03:09:14.710 --> 03:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
agnostic on that um we're simply
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
supportive of the idea of uh this and we
 
03:09:20.389 --> 03:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
do have a a letter here in support of
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
this um the letter indicates you know
 
03:09:25.389 --> 03:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
that the we have we have a housing
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
crisis you wouldn't ex exist as a
 
03:09:30.070 --> 03:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
committee if we didn't um so I'm not
 
03:09:32.070 --> 03:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to go into that I will point out
 
03:09:35.229 --> 03:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
as others have uh that the sprinkler
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in conversions of existing
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
structures to three and four uh units
 
03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
is very often prohibitively costly and
 
03:09:47.510 --> 03:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
that means prohibitively means it
 
03:09:49.710 --> 03:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen uh it's just too
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
expensive for the property owners to do
 
03:09:54.750 --> 03:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh and so this would relieve uh those
 
03:09:57.030 --> 03:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
Property Owners of that financial burden
 
03:09:58.870 --> 03:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
and allow these sorts of projects to
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
proceed this this is the kind of
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
development that we need more of in New
 
03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh to address uh this housing
 
03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
crisis uh and it is you know incremental
 
03:10:11.150 --> 03:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
infill it's small scale it doesn't
 
03:10:13.550 --> 03:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
require public subsidy it's just
 
03:10:15.630 --> 03:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
a really really good and smart thing to
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and Mr Sherman in his testimony
 
03:10:27.630 --> 03:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
addressed a question and this is with
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
regard to the phrase on lines five and
 
03:10:34.030 --> 03:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
six of the bill where it says uh
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
existing residential buildings and I I I
 
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
think that that is uh unnecessarily
 
03:10:43.150 --> 03:10:43.160 align:start position:0%
restrictive and so I would recommend a
 
03:10:46.190 --> 03:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
change so that it reads um shall not be
 
03:10:49.190 --> 03:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
required in existing buildings intended
 
03:10:52.429 --> 03:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
for no more than four dwelling units
 
03:10:54.750 --> 03:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
that allows for the conversion of
 
03:10:57.550 --> 03:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
existing commercial structures to be
 
03:11:00.309 --> 03:11:00.319 align:start position:0%
converted to residential and that
 
03:11:02.550 --> 03:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
eliminates that that uh
 
03:11:06.150 --> 03:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
confusion um if the committee chooses to
 
03:11:09.750 --> 03:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead with this bill uh then I agree
 
03:11:12.990 --> 03:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
with Mr Moore's recommendation that to
 
03:11:15.110 --> 03:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
include notwithstanding any other
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
provision of the law uh contrary so uh
 
03:11:21.469 --> 03:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
to the contrary because it it captures
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
that um message that this is what the
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
legislature means everywhere uh and and
 
03:11:31.389 --> 03:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
I think would also address uh the local
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment question as well um I'll pass
 
03:11:35.910 --> 03:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
out the letter happy to take any
 
03:11:37.870 --> 03:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for for Ben Frost uh
 
03:11:43.550 --> 03:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
03:11:45.150 --> 03:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question and
 
03:11:48.150 --> 03:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
for all your expertise that's helped us
 
03:11:51.190 --> 03:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
does your letter include the possible
 
03:11:53.710 --> 03:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment language that you just um
 
03:11:56.510 --> 03:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
suggested for line five and six it does
 
03:11:58.469 --> 03:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
not because I didn't realize it was
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
necessary until Mr Sherman spoke could
 
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
you perhaps email that to us I would be
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
happy to draft it thank you so
 
03:12:07.990 --> 03:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
much okay thank you very much for your
 
03:12:10.550 --> 03:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I have two speakers left um
 
03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:11.670 align:start position:0%

03:12:21.910 --> 03:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the committee um a lot of what I
 
03:12:25.590 --> 03:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up has been spoken by
 
03:12:27.990 --> 03:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
other people so I will be very brief and
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again um I am a
 
03:12:32.710 --> 03:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
homeowner from Manchester I recently
 
03:12:34.349 --> 03:12:34.359 align:start position:0%
bought a three-unit house down there so
 
03:12:35.710 --> 03:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
I own one of the buildings that we're
 
03:12:38.150 --> 03:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
actually talking about here um as
 
03:12:40.110 --> 03:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
everybody in here knows we have a
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
housing crisis going on right now prices
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
have been going crazy I paid
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
$525,000 for this place two years ago
 
03:12:50.110 --> 03:12:50.120 align:start position:0%
the tax assessment says it was only
 
03:12:52.269 --> 03:12:52.279 align:start position:0%
worth $390 that's
 
03:12:55.389 --> 03:12:55.399 align:start position:0%
$135,000 increase in two years about 15
 
03:12:56.830 --> 03:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
years ago these types of buildings were
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
only worth about 180,000 so they've
 
03:13:01.550 --> 03:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
tripled in value in 15
 
03:13:04.110 --> 03:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
years the sprinkler situation is
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
particularly pertinent my property um
 
03:13:09.389 --> 03:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
Insurance person told me that the
 
03:13:12.229 --> 03:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
replacement cost for this house to bring
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
it up the modern building code which
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
includes sprinklers would be
 
03:13:19.030 --> 03:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
$750,000 that's what they cover so I
 
03:13:21.469 --> 03:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
paid $525 but to build a new house if it
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
burned to the ground would be a 50%
 
03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
increase over the cost that I actually
 
03:13:28.150 --> 03:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
paid for it as somebody else mentioned
 
03:13:31.269 --> 03:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
sprinkles cost like $330,000 to put into
 
03:13:33.910 --> 03:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
buildings in some cities say maintenance
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
costs of thousands of dollars every year
 
03:13:37.269 --> 03:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
to have the sprinklers tied into the
 
03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
fire department to maintain them so
 
03:13:41.790 --> 03:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
these things cost a lot for people who
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
have existing houses they cost a lot for
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
new buildings and um I'm surprised I
 
03:13:48.150 --> 03:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anybody mention this term
 
03:13:49.630 --> 03:13:49.640 align:start position:0%
yet but one of the problems they have
 
03:13:51.070 --> 03:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
with housing now is what they refer to
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
as the missing Middle where you have
 
03:13:55.269 --> 03:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
home builders where they're willing to
 
03:13:57.349 --> 03:13:57.359 align:start position:0%
build expensive single families and
 
03:13:59.269 --> 03:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
expensive duplexes but they don't want
 
03:14:01.030 --> 03:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
to build three and four units anymore
 
03:14:03.070 --> 03:14:03.080 align:start position:0%
because even in new construction this
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
stuff is cost prohibitive and so they're
 
03:14:07.630 --> 03:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
only building expensive houses for like
 
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
Upper Middle Class Type people or
 
03:14:11.710 --> 03:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
they're building multi-units which cost
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars but then it's it's
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
profitable again for them to be investor
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
properties making three and four unit
 
03:14:21.070 --> 03:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
houses affordable to build again I think
 
03:14:23.070 --> 03:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
is vital toward fixing the housing
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
crisis and so I would 100% support this
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
bill and I would support even
 
03:14:29.790 --> 03:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
considering extending this to saying
 
03:14:31.429 --> 03:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
that even new construction if they're
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
three and four unit houses that they
 
03:14:35.670 --> 03:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
should not require Sprinklers and I'd
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
invite you to look at some of the other
 
03:14:39.429 --> 03:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
um requirements that they place on them
 
03:14:41.110 --> 03:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
to make them so expensive as they are
 
03:14:43.469 --> 03:14:43.479 align:start position:0%
nowadays um
 
03:14:45.150 --> 03:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
I that's basically everything I had to
 
03:14:48.110 --> 03:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
say um to answer one of the questions
 
03:14:50.510 --> 03:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
that came up from Mr yella earlier I
 
03:14:52.830 --> 03:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
know that right now there is an RSA that
 
03:14:55.469 --> 03:14:55.479 align:start position:0%
specifically says that localities can
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
add to but not subtract from the
 
03:14:59.510 --> 03:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
building code and so cities do that very
 
03:15:00.990 --> 03:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
frequently it's like you have your base
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
building code that's passed and then the
 
03:15:04.990 --> 03:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
cities can basically add more and more
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
requirements to that if they feel it's
 
03:15:09.349 --> 03:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
necessary the um testifier from dur
 
03:15:10.670 --> 03:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I know they do that in
 
03:15:12.429 --> 03:15:12.439 align:start position:0%
Manchester too so that's definitely a
 
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
concern of why this bill would be a good
 
03:15:17.269 --> 03:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
idea add the notwithstanding Clause to
 
03:15:18.670 --> 03:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
the beginning of it and make it clear
 
03:15:20.429 --> 03:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
that localities can't just override this
 
03:15:22.830 --> 03:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
if they choose to I would be happy to
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
take any questions that you may have
 
03:15:26.349 --> 03:15:26.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:15:28.990 --> 03:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and you
 
03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
might not be the right person to ask but
 
03:15:34.950 --> 03:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
I'm just I thought of this a little
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
while ago and and didn't have the
 
03:15:40.030 --> 03:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity as so I'm asking it now so
 
03:15:42.469 --> 03:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
the section of law that this is amending
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
as I read it because it's under State
 
03:15:47.630 --> 03:15:47.640 align:start position:0%
Fire code and rules would prevent the
 
03:15:50.790 --> 03:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
state from setting a regulation a State
 
03:15:54.389 --> 03:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
Building Code or fire code to
 
03:15:57.389 --> 03:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
require um sprinklers on everything
 
03:15:59.950 --> 03:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
through four but does this as it's
 
03:16:03.189 --> 03:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
written being in this section prevent
 
03:16:06.429 --> 03:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities from from adding to that
 
03:16:08.229 --> 03:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I would
 
03:16:10.070 --> 03:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to that I read a lot
 
03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
of legislation but I'm not an attorney
 
03:16:13.950 --> 03:16:13.960 align:start position:0%
or an expert on
 
03:16:15.950 --> 03:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
this any other questions thank you for
 
03:16:18.269 --> 03:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you I'm now calling
 
03:16:26.189 --> 03:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
axan hi good morning and thank you very
 
03:16:30.790 --> 03:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
much A lot has been said so I won't
 
03:16:33.309 --> 03:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
repeat all of it too much um since your
 
03:16:35.950 --> 03:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
hours behind I'll hold off on the full
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
voluntarist philosophical lecture I
 
03:16:39.710 --> 03:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
prepared it was only 5 10 hours
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you yeah so um
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
obviously this this is about property
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
rights if people own a house if I own a
 
03:16:50.630 --> 03:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
Triplex a quadplex then it should be up
 
03:16:54.030 --> 03:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
to me um obviously this is something
 
03:16:55.189 --> 03:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
that you guys all know because you are
 
03:16:57.189 --> 03:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
the experts in this and you propose this
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill it'll make housing cheaper more
 
03:17:02.269 --> 03:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
affordable more inventory um so more
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
housing available I actually have a
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
relative who's leaving the military
 
03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
right now transitioning out via
 
03:17:10.630 --> 03:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
internship looking for an apartment or a
 
03:17:12.469 --> 03:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
place to rent in Southern New Hampshire
 
03:17:13.550 --> 03:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
this is something that would make it
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
easier because more
 
03:17:17.950 --> 03:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
inventory um I don't think that the
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
government should be requiring uh
 
03:17:22.750 --> 03:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
certain sprinkler systems and though I'm
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
a voluntarist I don't believe in any of
 
03:17:27.349 --> 03:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
these regulations I had a small house
 
03:17:29.110 --> 03:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
fire that was still terribly damaging I
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
would not wish that on anyone um so I
 
03:17:33.229 --> 03:17:33.239 align:start position:0%
take it extremely seriously um having uh
 
03:17:35.070 --> 03:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems and all that the good
 
03:17:38.429 --> 03:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
thing is that because of uh modern
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
building and and all the advances in
 
03:17:42.510 --> 03:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
modern technology and the fact fact that
 
03:17:44.790 --> 03:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
you can buy like fire extinguishers and
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
I think I bought one a while ago it's
 
03:17:47.670 --> 03:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
like a mini with the foam and everything
 
03:17:48.990 --> 03:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
a fire extinguisher you could buy for a
 
03:17:50.910 --> 03:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
few bucks um you can have that in your
 
03:17:53.309 --> 03:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
house as well and the bill says that you
 
03:17:55.510 --> 03:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
still have to have all the other fire
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
code um requirements even in these uh
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
these buildings so I also think that
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
this is something that should be handled
 
03:18:05.630 --> 03:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
by the owners and the renters if the
 
03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
renter thinks if I'm going to rent a
 
03:18:09.670 --> 03:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
place if I think it's made of wood and
 
03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
has no fire alarms and no sprinkler
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
system and you know it's in a dry place
 
03:18:15.389 --> 03:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
where there are matches maybe I won't
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
rent there so it's up to me and it's up
 
03:18:18.750 --> 03:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
to the owners to prove it safe and it's
 
03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
up to insurances I'm not an expert in
 
03:18:23.309 --> 03:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
insurance or anything in this realm but
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
I think um home insurance and stuff will
 
03:18:27.750 --> 03:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
take care of this for instance if you're
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
in a wooden log cabin in a very dry
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
place like Arizona your fire type of
 
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:34.680 align:start position:0%
insurance and housing might be more
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
expensive so I think they'll take care
 
03:18:40.150 --> 03:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
of that um I would I would also support
 
03:18:43.269 --> 03:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
an amendment to include um the new
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
buildings even though it's maybe not
 
03:18:46.950 --> 03:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
quite as costly I think new buildings
 
03:18:48.750 --> 03:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
should also be exempt from this for a
 
03:18:50.990 --> 03:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
Triplex and quadplex um again just on
 
03:18:53.469 --> 03:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
the property rights issue and on the uh
 
03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
cost of building and availability of
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
housing issue um and I think my my last
 
03:19:00.590 --> 03:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
point I have written down is um there's
 
03:19:01.950 --> 03:19:01.960 align:start position:0%
been some Talk of the technicality of
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
whether to do this by the like
 
03:19:06.830 --> 03:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
Administrative Code versus legislation I
 
03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
generally support legislation
 
03:19:11.469 --> 03:19:11.479 align:start position:0%
legislators make legislation I you know
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
same route as you guys all know and even
 
03:19:15.990 --> 03:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
though this is not an administrative
 
03:19:18.309 --> 03:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
rule that could be made like in an
 
03:19:20.550 --> 03:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
instant by just people adjusting code
 
03:19:21.550 --> 03:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
apparently they have to come here and
 
03:19:24.189 --> 03:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
get it approved that is awesome but I
 
03:19:25.790 --> 03:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
think what they've mentioned earlier
 
03:19:27.950 --> 03:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
because this is all new to me apparently
 
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:29.279 align:start position:0%
it's like an Omnibus kind of thing where
 
03:19:31.469 --> 03:19:31.479 align:start position:0%
they can put in you know infinite
 
03:19:33.469 --> 03:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
proposed rules and then the legislature
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
signs off on it like um uh consent
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
calendar or Omnibus type of deal and
 
03:19:40.469 --> 03:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
then so they could put in all sorts of
 
03:19:42.229 --> 03:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
stuff there where this is one bill for
 
03:19:44.349 --> 03:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
one specific thing um so it's like a one
 
03:19:47.269 --> 03:19:47.279 align:start position:0%
subject kind of deal so I I think that's
 
03:19:50.550 --> 03:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
all I have here too um I think
 
03:19:51.870 --> 03:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative Joella just mentioned
 
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we all somehow missed that it just
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
says state it doesn't say municipalities
 
03:19:58.229 --> 03:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
can't require this sorry it was you you
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
look so similar that I just yeah um yeah
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know how we all missed that but
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
but if there's an amendment to the bill
 
03:20:07.750 --> 03:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
um to to include municipalities
 
03:20:08.910 --> 03:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
especially with Dylan's rule you know
 
03:20:10.750 --> 03:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
not being able to do this to require
 
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
more stretch rules so I mentioned that
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously not a fan of like uh more
 
03:20:17.550 --> 03:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
strict stretch rual type stuff by
 
03:20:19.349 --> 03:20:19.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities um so I think that's all
 
03:20:21.309 --> 03:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
03:20:23.630 --> 03:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
for your testimony any questions for Mr
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
axelman thank you much much is there
 
03:20:27.790 --> 03:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
anybody else that's here to testify on
 
03:20:27.800 --> 03:20:30.309 align:start position:0%
anybody else that's here to testify on
HP

03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
HP
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
1065 representative Walsh yeah thank you
 
03:20:34.510 --> 03:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and I apologize for being late
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
I was not slacking I was at a
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
transportation council meeting uh but
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
while people are still in the room and I
 
03:20:42.910 --> 03:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't I think we lost our building codes
 
03:20:45.429 --> 03:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
expert did the authority in the fire
 
03:20:47.670 --> 03:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
codes in particular in terms of whether
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
we leave it in rules or whether we go in
 
03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
statute was the authority having
 
03:20:54.910 --> 03:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's in N fpa1 brought up
 
03:20:54.920 --> 03:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that's in N fpa1 brought up
at

03:20:55.750 --> 03:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:20:58.229 --> 03:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
all and and and the reason I ask would
 
03:20:59.790 --> 03:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
they still have the authority if we
 
03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't put it in statute to do more than
 
03:21:05.349 --> 03:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
than what we're seeking and the second
 
03:21:07.229 --> 03:21:07.239 align:start position:0%
part of my question I know Marshall tum
 
03:21:10.269 --> 03:21:10.279 align:start position:0%
is here um I'm wondering if we can ask
 
03:21:12.750 --> 03:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
next time he's here if the bill codes
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a similar provision that would also
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
give uh Code Enforcement Officers the
 
03:21:21.469 --> 03:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
same latitude uh in other words you can
 
03:21:22.830 --> 03:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
see where I'm saying I think we should
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
be leaning towards the legislation I
 
03:21:25.710 --> 03:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
figured I'd ask if it was already
 
03:21:28.710 --> 03:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
brought up I haven't heard that being
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
brought up thank you representative Reed
 
03:21:33.189 --> 03:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and not to turn this
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
into an exec or debate but um I I
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
understand just to clarify where we're
 
03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
at I understand that no matter what it
 
03:21:44.030 --> 03:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
will be dealt with legislatively because
 
03:21:45.670 --> 03:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's either this bill or it's the Senate
 
03:21:48.189 --> 03:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
Bill the question is do we like what's
 
03:21:49.429 --> 03:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
in the Senate bill and do we trust that
 
03:21:50.550 --> 03:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
it's going to go all the way through
 
03:21:52.429 --> 03:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
without being changed from what this
 
03:21:54.269 --> 03:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
committee would like to see so it's
 
03:21:57.590 --> 03:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to be legislative it has to be but
 
03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
the question the larger question that's
 
03:22:01.229 --> 03:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
come up is that much of our testimony
 
03:22:03.150 --> 03:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
that we've heard right now has been
 
03:22:05.349 --> 03:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
presuming that this is prohibiting towns
 
03:22:06.990 --> 03:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
as it is written and I just kind of
 
03:22:09.950 --> 03:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
double checked with some experts it only
 
03:22:12.269 --> 03:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
is saying that the state will not to the
 
03:22:14.950 --> 03:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
state's building code the requirement
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
for for three and four so this would
 
03:22:20.030 --> 03:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
still allow towns to add to it so the
 
03:22:21.550 --> 03:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
question then becomes what is the intent
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
of this committee and do we then change
 
03:22:27.150 --> 03:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
it yep okay so thank you for that
 
03:22:29.710 --> 03:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
feedback um this is not the last time
 
03:22:31.990 --> 03:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with this bill um
 
03:22:33.469 --> 03:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm closing the public hearing
 
03:22:36.030 --> 03:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
on 1065 and I'm going to open a public
 
03:22:39.389 --> 03:22:39.399 align:start position:0%
hearing on 12:15 and call on the prime
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:13.309 --> 03:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman members of
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm
 
03:23:16.670 --> 03:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative Scott Wallace Rockingham
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
County District 8 the town of Danville
 
03:23:22.269 --> 03:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to introduce House Bill 1215
 
03:23:24.189 --> 03:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
relative to subdivision regulations and
 
03:23:25.910 --> 03:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
the completion of improvements in the
 
03:23:27.469 --> 03:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
regulation of building
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
permits uh the Genesis for this bill
 
03:23:33.550 --> 03:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
came from uh this committee we heard
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
many uh
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders those being Builders
 
03:23:40.990 --> 03:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
developers um saying that they have run
 
03:23:44.670 --> 03:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
into many many times that um once a
 
03:23:47.550 --> 03:23:47.560 align:start position:0%
building permit is issued or a
 
03:23:47.560 --> 03:23:49.150 align:start position:0%
building permit is issued or a
subdivision

03:23:49.150 --> 03:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh plan
 
03:23:54.189 --> 03:23:54.199 align:start position:0%
approved between the time that permit
 
03:23:57.910 --> 03:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
was issued and seeking final sign offs
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
there may have been some legis uh some
 
03:24:02.349 --> 03:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes building code changes
 
03:24:02.359 --> 03:24:03.710 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes building code changes
local

03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances that the town's uh officials
 
03:24:09.550 --> 03:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
Force the developers to bring their
 
03:24:12.229 --> 03:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
projects up to code with and see that we
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
in the uh legislature are prohibited
 
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
from making any retrospective laws by
 
03:24:18.830 --> 03:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution part the
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
2 article 23 all political subdivisions
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
are also subject to that same
 
03:24:26.830 --> 03:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
prohibition on retrospective law that
 
03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
being said this bill would simply uh put
 
03:24:32.590 --> 03:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
into statute that when you are issued an
 
03:24:35.710 --> 03:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
a building permit by a particular
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
municipality once you start that project
 
03:24:40.389 --> 03:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
any changes in the building ordinance
 
03:24:42.110 --> 03:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
can't be forced upon that
 
03:24:44.710 --> 03:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
that Builder on that particular project
 
03:24:48.389 --> 03:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
um that's not to say when a subdivision
 
03:24:48.399 --> 03:24:49.150 align:start position:0%
um that's not to say when a subdivision
is

03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:24:52.110 --> 03:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
approved uh let that might take several
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
years before that gets
 
03:24:56.630 --> 03:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
underway the building codes May evolve
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
the building permits wouldn't be issued
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
at the time of the subdivision approval
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
so any building codes could still evolve
 
03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
um after the uh passage of this bill um
 
03:25:11.309 --> 03:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
this is more or less to make sure that
 
03:25:13.790 --> 03:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh the anticipated costs of projects
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
remain um as anticipated and don't spir
 
03:25:20.070 --> 03:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of control due to subsequent uh
 
03:25:22.030 --> 03:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
passages of legislation zoning ordinance
 
03:25:24.790 --> 03:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
or building code rules so it's pretty
 
03:25:27.510 --> 03:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
much to say when the building permit or
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
project is approved any legislative or
 
03:25:32.790 --> 03:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
rule changes subsequent to that approval
 
03:25:35.030 --> 03:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
would not apply to that particular
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
project and that's pretty much the
 
03:25:38.389 --> 03:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
essence of the bill and I'm happy to
 
03:25:40.389 --> 03:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you for your
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I do know there's a um a
 
03:25:43.750 --> 03:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
number of people signed up to speak on
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
this that can add more insight on this
 
03:25:47.229 --> 03:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
as well corre any questions for
 
03:25:47.239 --> 03:25:48.469 align:start position:0%
as well corre any questions for
representative

03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you for your testimony
 
03:25:57.309 --> 03:25:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.150 --> 03:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
kind the chair would like to call on um
 
03:26:00.160 --> 03:26:09.110 align:start position:0%
kind the chair would like to call on um
Marshall

03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
Tumi good afternoon now back
 
03:26:14.150 --> 03:26:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
committee Sean Tumi State Fire Marshal
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
for the record
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Wallace your uh intro
 
03:26:24.910 --> 03:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
cleared up a lot of things for me um I I
 
03:26:27.189 --> 03:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
think that the my only concern with the
 
03:26:33.189 --> 03:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
bill is uh the lock in portion of it um
 
03:26:35.110 --> 03:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
what I read and what I kind of perceived
 
03:26:37.030 --> 03:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
from the reading of this bill is that if
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
the years later someone starts to do the
 
03:26:41.710 --> 03:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
construction and we're going going on
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
backwards years in the codes building
 
03:26:48.189 --> 03:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
and fire from a safety perspective um I
 
03:26:50.950 --> 03:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
think that once the permit's issued and
 
03:26:53.349 --> 03:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
work is progressing that we shouldn't
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
change Midstream if the work is going on
 
03:26:59.590 --> 03:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
on a building or fire code side so I I
 
03:27:01.870 --> 03:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
get that
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
um uh so I sorry you good um so I I I
 
03:27:09.429 --> 03:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
think uh maybe just making sure that
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
we're clear is that if I understand you
 
03:27:12.790 --> 03:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
right that you're your thought process
 
03:27:15.950 --> 03:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're good with uh sort of locking
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
things in once once the project starts
 
03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
you're locked in so if we we're in the
 
03:27:22.150 --> 03:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
2018 fire code for instance someone gets
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
their permane now and we go to the 21
 
03:27:27.990 --> 03:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
codes in in in 6 months or a year from
 
03:27:30.590 --> 03:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
now I don't start enforcing the 21 codes
 
03:27:32.870 --> 03:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
on them when those come in effect that's
 
03:27:35.389 --> 03:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to prevent correct
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm good I just I guess make
 
03:27:40.590 --> 03:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
sure make sure that the uh language
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
matches that that's that would be my
 
03:27:43.630 --> 03:27:43.640 align:start position:0%
only concern because I read it a little
 
03:27:45.630 --> 03:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
bit differently so and if you have any
 
03:27:47.550 --> 03:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
further questions this is a little bit
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
unusual but I'm more than happy to
 
03:27:51.790 --> 03:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
answer them okay okay uh representative
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
yell thank you thank you for uh your
 
03:27:59.309 --> 03:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony and I had heard some
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
Rumblings about similar views on this
 
03:28:07.349 --> 03:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if um on line 23 at the
 
03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
end it says no pending subdivision if
 
03:28:14.189 --> 03:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
that is sufficiently clear or you think
 
03:28:16.830 --> 03:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
it should be more clear that when let's
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
say the
 
03:28:23.150 --> 03:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
occupancy uh for such uh kind of plot or
 
03:28:26.429 --> 03:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
whatever or the conclusion of the actual
 
03:28:31.110 --> 03:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
pending thing before the um the you know
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
the plan or whatever so it's locked in
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
from you know applying until completion
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then you kind of start again when
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
you apply again to a new pending thing
 
03:28:43.150 --> 03:28:43.160 align:start position:0%
if that needs to be more clear you think
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
that the no pending on line 24 is
 
03:28:48.830 --> 03:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear or um
 
03:28:48.840 --> 03:28:51.229 align:start position:0%
sufficiently clear or um
since

03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
um if I mean you don't have to answer
 
03:28:55.349 --> 03:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
now you could just say I'll think about
 
03:28:56.990 --> 03:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
it and get back to the committee if it
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
if you think that there is some language
 
03:29:01.389 --> 03:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
that would be thank you for that bailout
 
03:29:05.309 --> 03:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
question I uh I I agree now again as
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
hearing it I agree with what you're
 
03:29:08.830 --> 03:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
trying to do we shouldn't be changing
 
03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
Midstream the the concern I had was we
 
03:29:14.469 --> 03:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
frequently get questions of I got the
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
subdivision approved 10 years ago um I'm
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
going to start building now uh if we
 
03:29:21.870 --> 03:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
have to go back to codes from 10 years
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
ago that's going to be much more
 
03:29:26.150 --> 03:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
challenging and I think that that was
 
03:29:29.070 --> 03:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
where my concern was but if if you've
 
03:29:31.389 --> 03:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
started building four years ago when we
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
were in the 2015 codes and you're
 
03:29:35.870 --> 03:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
continuing building a massive building
 
03:29:38.429 --> 03:29:38.439 align:start position:0%
stay with the 15 codes and finish your
 
03:29:40.950 --> 03:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
project um I'm I'm good with that it's
 
03:29:44.189 --> 03:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's the it's the holding forever
 
03:29:45.510 --> 03:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
kind of component that we had some
 
03:29:45.520 --> 03:29:46.550 align:start position:0%
kind of component that we had some
concerns

03:29:46.550 --> 03:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:29:50.070 --> 03:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
about if I could respond to that could I
 
03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
respond to that yep um to your
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
hypothetical the the legislative intent
 
03:29:56.790 --> 03:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
is say for example you've got your
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
subdivision is approved no building
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
actually starts for a period of years
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
say a decade when the building permits
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
are issued under this particular Bill
 
03:30:07.469 --> 03:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
the building permits and the so the
 
03:30:09.150 --> 03:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
building and fire and electrical code
 
03:30:11.670 --> 03:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
energy code would be current at the time
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
of issuance of the permit not the 10 the
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
decade old approval on the subdivision
 
03:30:18.429 --> 03:30:18.439 align:start position:0%
only the 10-year-old subdivision rules
 
03:30:21.150 --> 03:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
would apply and that if that helps it it
 
03:30:22.870 --> 03:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
makes it much more clear I'm going to go
 
03:30:26.309 --> 03:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
sit down and you're support huh you're
 
03:30:29.189 --> 03:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
now in support yeah just I want to Think
 
03:30:30.349 --> 03:30:30.359 align:start position:0%
Through the language a little bit make
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
sure we're speaking the same language
 
03:30:35.830 --> 03:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
right we're we are I think thank
 
03:30:39.469 --> 03:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
repr thank you
 
03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question uh
 
03:30:46.429 --> 03:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
would you mind and I I don't know that
 
03:30:48.030 --> 03:30:48.040 align:start position:0%
you feel may feel comfortable I don't
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
know if it's in your purview to write
 
03:30:52.750 --> 03:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
amendments but um would you mind sending
 
03:30:56.429 --> 03:30:56.439 align:start position:0%
the committee recommended uh language
 
03:30:59.309 --> 03:30:59.319 align:start position:0%
that maintains the legislative intent as
 
03:31:04.229 --> 03:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
spoken to but avoids any um unforeseen
 
03:31:05.790 --> 03:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
consequences that you might be worried
 
03:31:08.790 --> 03:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
about I am happy to help with that thank
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
you great any other questions Marshall
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
to me thank you for your testimony thank
 
03:31:16.910 --> 03:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
you right next I'd like to call on Phil
 
03:31:25.389 --> 03:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
see Mr chair members of the committee I
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
will plead total confusion over what
 
03:31:33.830 --> 03:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is getting at however
 
03:31:37.030 --> 03:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh the the committee should be sure they
 
03:31:38.830 --> 03:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
understand that currently at the point
 
03:31:41.309 --> 03:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
you apply for a building permit that
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
code is locked in statutorily till the
 
03:31:47.110 --> 03:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
end of that project if we talk about a
 
03:31:49.309 --> 03:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
subdivision where there may be one site
 
03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
plan approval but multiple building
 
03:31:54.110 --> 03:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
permits as houses go along the codes
 
03:31:56.429 --> 03:31:56.439 align:start position:0%
track with the house so if somebody
 
03:31:58.590 --> 03:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
Waits 20 years to build the the last
 
03:32:02.189 --> 03:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
house they'd be on the the then updated
 
03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
code I'm not clear given the previous
 
03:32:07.269 --> 03:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
conversation whether that's the intent
 
03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
or or what I was reading which I thought
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
was once I build to today's code that's
 
03:32:14.070 --> 03:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
the building code on that building
 
03:32:18.510 --> 03:32:18.520 align:start position:0%
forever more uh so the the code is
 
03:32:20.189 --> 03:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
locked in for a project there's no
 
03:32:22.070 --> 03:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
question about that at
 
03:32:25.830 --> 03:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
15582 part one
 
03:32:30.269 --> 03:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm concerned that in fact references
 
03:32:32.550 --> 03:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
to building codes in general in this
 
03:32:35.469 --> 03:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
bill don't don't really add much to that
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
if I understand your intent properly I
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
think you could focus in on the site
 
03:32:43.110 --> 03:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
plan and preserve that for all time but
 
03:32:44.469 --> 03:32:44.479 align:start position:0%
then when somebody comes along and
 
03:32:45.910 --> 03:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually builds something they pull a
 
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
permit on the code that's in effect at
 
03:32:50.150 --> 03:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
the time I think somebody I had a
 
03:32:52.750 --> 03:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
conversation with mentioned a very large
 
03:32:55.990 --> 03:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
subdivision say a 100 homes and somebody
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
was building and building and then
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
suddenly the code changed in Midstream
 
03:33:04.189 --> 03:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
well there one we have about a two to
 
03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
threee process to update the codes two
 
03:33:08.750 --> 03:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
we have a six-month grace period which
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
will handle most projects um but it's
 
03:33:14.870 --> 03:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
not all that hard to know what's coming
 
03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
down the pike at this point if you
 
03:33:18.309 --> 03:33:18.319 align:start position:0%
really think it's going to be a
 
03:33:20.429 --> 03:33:20.439 align:start position:0%
multi-year thing but what if it's a
 
03:33:22.510 --> 03:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
20-year thing what if it's more than
 
03:33:24.469 --> 03:33:24.479 align:start position:0%
just straddling a code what if it goes
 
03:33:27.269 --> 03:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
out out forever and I'm not a zoning or
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
a planning expert so I don't know
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
whether there's another clock that ticks
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
on that end um I would like to comment
 
03:33:36.590 --> 03:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
on our favorite uh city in the world New
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
York City because they actually do lock
 
03:33:41.309 --> 03:33:41.319 align:start position:0%
in the old code on existing buildings
 
03:33:43.429 --> 03:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
so in my professional life I had to go
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
read the 1938 building code because the
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
building was built under that code
 
03:33:51.630 --> 03:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
pre-World War II however as they've
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
gotten into this they said well you we
 
03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
really don't want you to build the
 
03:33:57.750 --> 03:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
electrical system under the 1938
 
03:34:00.030 --> 03:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
electrical code or the sprinkler system
 
03:34:02.030 --> 03:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
or the plumbing system all that the
 
03:34:04.510 --> 03:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
Technology's completely changed so
 
03:34:06.990 --> 03:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
they've now got a stack of paper and
 
03:34:08.790 --> 03:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
you'd have to be a lawyer to get through
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
it to understand whether you're really
 
03:34:14.429 --> 03:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
on the 1938 code or all these pieces
 
03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
that have come along the way have put
 
03:34:19.389 --> 03:34:19.399 align:start position:0%
you pretty much on the new code anyway
 
03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
so there there is that problem and the
 
03:34:24.750 --> 03:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
other part of it U is to just keep in
 
03:34:27.550 --> 03:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
mind that people with much larger shoes
 
03:34:29.790 --> 03:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
than I worked very hard to get a
 
03:34:32.910 --> 03:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide building coat in 2002 it went
 
03:34:36.590 --> 03:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
into effect in 2003 and if inspectors
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
designers and and certainly contractors
 
03:34:41.429 --> 03:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
have to start dealing with multiple
 
03:34:44.429 --> 03:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
codes some of which could be very old uh
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
out the window goes the idea that
 
03:34:48.389 --> 03:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
everybody is is pretty much working off
 
03:34:52.110 --> 03:34:52.120 align:start position:0%
the same piece of paper so in summary I
 
03:34:53.469 --> 03:34:53.479 align:start position:0%
I would hope that you could kind of
 
03:34:55.309 --> 03:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
carve building and fire codes out of
 
03:34:57.590 --> 03:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
this thing focus on the site plan
 
03:34:59.189 --> 03:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
approval if that's really where the
 
03:35:01.830 --> 03:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
where the major issue is happy to take
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
any questions um I'm I'm going to go
 
03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
ahead and ask a question so in a
 
03:35:09.110 --> 03:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision of 40 Properties or 50
 
03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
properties and they're built over a
 
03:35:11.590 --> 03:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
certain number of years somebody
 
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
purchases the land they want to build it
 
03:35:16.590 --> 03:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
do you think the code if the code's okay
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
for the first house that's built do you
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
think the code should be okay for the
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
last house that's built the same
 
03:35:26.750 --> 03:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
code I I think if if there's a a
 
03:35:28.990 --> 03:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable time frame that might be
 
03:35:31.510 --> 03:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
something to look at you know say three
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
to five years where you'd be one one
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
addition back or something like that but
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
to put it out as a as an infinite amount
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
of time when you say okay well the codes
 
03:35:43.710 --> 03:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
learn and they frequently learn from
 
03:35:45.910 --> 03:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
problems or they learn from other
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
regulations whether it's flood or energy
 
03:35:51.030 --> 03:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever um and you know there's some
 
03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
expectation that modern stuff gets built
 
03:35:55.469 --> 03:35:55.479 align:start position:0%
to Modern codes because you could make
 
03:35:56.950 --> 03:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
that same argument about a house that
 
03:35:59.710 --> 03:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
was built in 1820 why why build it to a
 
03:36:01.389 --> 03:36:01.399 align:start position:0%
new code
 
03:36:04.469 --> 03:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you other
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for Testimony thank
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
you oh represent one second represent
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you for taking my question
 
03:36:12.429 --> 03:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
while I appreciate and understand that
 
03:36:14.710 --> 03:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
what you said is accurate that these uh
 
03:36:16.349 --> 03:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
the code is Frozen at the issuance of
 
03:36:18.269 --> 03:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
the permit it's been my personal
 
03:36:21.229 --> 03:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
experience in two significant projects
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
during my career uh where that hasn't
 
03:36:25.269 --> 03:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
been the case and one of them was a
 
03:36:27.550 --> 03:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
commercial building I had to go and add
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
sprinklers to after receiving my co fire
 
03:36:34.870 --> 03:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
um permit sign off and open for business
 
03:36:36.550 --> 03:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay I had to go in after the fact and
 
03:36:38.349 --> 03:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
add sprinklers you can imagine what that
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
cost so although although that is the
 
03:36:43.229 --> 03:36:43.239 align:start position:0%
case in practice there are
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and again I've run
 
03:36:48.030 --> 03:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
into that in other towns that will ask
 
03:36:49.550 --> 03:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
for things over and above what is
 
03:36:52.150 --> 03:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
actually in code for whatever reason it
 
03:36:54.189 --> 03:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
does happen and this will by putting
 
03:36:56.950 --> 03:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
this in statute this will make it clear
 
03:36:59.830 --> 03:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
to the towns um that that's not supposed
 
03:37:01.750 --> 03:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
to happen would you agree with that well
 
03:37:03.630 --> 03:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
I'd agree that there certainly are cases
 
03:37:05.229 --> 03:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
where somebody just reaches into their
 
03:37:08.110 --> 03:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
pocket and says this is what I Want U sp
 
03:37:10.950 --> 03:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
sp 437 that was discussed previously
 
03:37:13.110 --> 03:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
is attempting to get our arms around
 
03:37:15.469 --> 03:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
that uh there would be a very painless
 
03:37:18.670 --> 03:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
review process but if if we on the bcrb
 
03:37:20.590 --> 03:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that ordinance it's
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
unenforcable so whether that flies or
 
03:37:25.670 --> 03:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
not we'll we'll see so that should fix
 
03:37:27.630 --> 03:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
the person who's just you know dreaming
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
up a requirement on their own um the
 
03:37:32.630 --> 03:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
fire code is a special case but the
 
03:37:35.189 --> 03:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
building code is very very clear that
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
once I have that application filed for
 
03:37:40.469 --> 03:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
the permit or whatever is covered by
 
03:37:43.590 --> 03:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
that permit I'm good you know if some
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
official is violating a law yes
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely maybe we need to look at that
 
03:37:51.990 --> 03:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
side it thanks representative uh wsh yep
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
question I'll ask again a question I
 
03:37:57.429 --> 03:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
asked on the last bill that's still
 
03:37:58.910 --> 03:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
relative to this one while you're out of
 
03:38:01.229 --> 03:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
the room within the building codes
 
03:38:03.150 --> 03:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code is there any
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
Authority granted to uh your Municipal
 
03:38:09.550 --> 03:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
Code Enforcement Officers to interpret
 
03:38:11.950 --> 03:38:11.960 align:start position:0%
and determine in a different course on
 
03:38:15.229 --> 03:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
any of the uh rules that may be there
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
for example like in the fire codes
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's the authority having
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that can basically
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
customize what's required depending on
 
03:38:22.960 --> 03:38:24.269 align:start position:0%
customize what's required depending on
the

03:38:24.269 --> 03:38:24.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:26.630 --> 03:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances I'll give you my personal
 
03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
view just having worked in the code
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
world for some 40 years now I think the
 
03:38:35.189 --> 03:38:35.199 align:start position:0%
building codes in general try to be very
 
03:38:37.030 --> 03:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
explicit you should be able to pick it
 
03:38:38.950 --> 03:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
up read it do what it says and everybody
 
03:38:41.110 --> 03:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
ought to be happy now that being said
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
are there times when somebody needs to
 
03:38:44.469 --> 03:38:44.479 align:start position:0%
interpret something sure it's the
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
English language and there may be places
 
03:38:49.950 --> 03:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
out at the margins where something isn't
 
03:38:53.229 --> 03:38:53.239 align:start position:0%
clear I'll stick my head way out the
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
window here um I think NFPA and the fire
 
03:38:58.510 --> 03:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
code take a little bit more of the view
 
03:39:01.630 --> 03:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
that the ahj through a very active and
 
03:39:05.110 --> 03:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
and and present variance process can
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
deal with some of these bigger issues so
 
03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
there's you know there are there are
 
03:39:11.309 --> 03:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the building code for what
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
they call code modifications there are
 
03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
Provisions for alternative means and
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
methods those kinds of things coming
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
with a some new machine that hasn't been
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
approved yet that's all there's a way to
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
deal with that um but we have no
 
03:39:26.710 --> 03:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
variance process just for that reason
 
03:39:28.510 --> 03:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
and I think that tends to keep the the
 
03:39:30.429 --> 03:39:30.439 align:start position:0%
Cod writers to the you know feet to the
 
03:39:31.790 --> 03:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
fire so that they've got to write
 
03:39:33.870 --> 03:39:33.880 align:start position:0%
sections that are understandable and
 
03:39:37.030 --> 03:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
have a beginning and an end
 
03:39:39.990 --> 03:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you you're welcome okay see no
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
other questions thank of your
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
testimony is William mckin in the room I
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
don't see him yet I might call on him if
 
03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.110 --> 03:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
Mo thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record again my name
 
03:40:00.990 --> 03:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
is Greg Moore Regional director for
 
03:40:02.510 --> 03:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Americans for Prosperity here today
 
03:40:04.189 --> 03:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
testify in support of this
 
03:40:07.229 --> 03:40:07.239 align:start position:0%
legislation I would say that that at at
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
the very least is there's no downside to
 
03:40:11.790 --> 03:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
belt and susp rendering uh what we
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
believe is practice where I have heard
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
there to be a variance is often times
 
03:40:20.110 --> 03:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
when a when a municipality will approve
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
a project and from the point of approval
 
03:40:24.469 --> 03:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
to the point of completion there was a
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
change in the code enforcement officer
 
03:40:28.710 --> 03:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
so you have a different person putting
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
eyes on uh what what is approved and
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
I've heard that from several developers
 
03:40:37.070 --> 03:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
you have a dynamic in which a d Dynamic
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
which a new code enforcement officer
 
03:40:41.070 --> 03:40:41.080 align:start position:0%
comes in there's a change and that new
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
code enforcement officer is is applying
 
03:40:45.189 --> 03:40:45.199 align:start position:0%
a different standard than what was
 
03:40:47.030 --> 03:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
approved by a prior code enforcement
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
officer so I think that is a specific
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
instance uh the use case why this
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation is important so I know
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
you're way behind I'm going to stop
 
03:40:57.309 --> 03:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
talking and I'll take questions any
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
questions for Greg
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
M seeing none thank you for your
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:15.349 align:start position:0%
 
Frost

03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good afternoon
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
committee members again uh Ben Frost
 
03:41:20.790 --> 03:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
Deputy executive director and chief
 
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
legal officer at New Hampshire housing
 
03:41:24.950 --> 03:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
um we are in support of this legislation
 
03:41:27.790 --> 03:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
and really it's because of the the
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
overall approach of it and that is to um
 
03:41:34.750 --> 03:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
provide important protections for
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
property owners who have received
 
03:41:39.269 --> 03:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
approvals uh particularly from local
 
03:41:40.630 --> 03:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
planning boards
 
03:41:42.229 --> 03:41:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh to proceed with some sort of
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
development uh and it protects those
 
03:41:46.870 --> 03:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
these developments from future changes
 
03:41:50.550 --> 03:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
to um codes and regulations I
 
03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that um there are issues
 
03:41:55.990 --> 03:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
particularly with the building and fire
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
codes I don't want to speak to those I
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
do confess um uh similar uh to a prior
 
03:42:05.550 --> 03:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
speaker confusion over the language of
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bill and the and the prime sponsor's
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
intention so I I think there may be some
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
a further discussion of that in either
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
outside of the Committee hearing or uh
 
03:42:16.950 --> 03:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
in a work session would be appropriate
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
because I think that this does go to an
 
03:42:22.189 --> 03:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
important objective um I want to focus
 
03:42:24.149 --> 03:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
on section one of the bill which deals
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
with the existing statute RSA
 
03:42:29.149 --> 03:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
67439 which is currently the so-called
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
five-year exemption and IT addresses uh
 
03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
planning board approvals for
 
03:42:36.750 --> 03:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and site plans um as
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
currently structured uh this
 
03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
law provides five years of protection
 
03:42:49.469 --> 03:42:49.479 align:start position:0%
for uh planning board approvals that is
 
03:42:51.830 --> 03:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
the the the owner gets five years of
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
protection against changes to uh local
 
03:42:57.790 --> 03:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
zoning or subdivision or site plan
 
03:43:00.910 --> 03:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
regulations provided within the first
 
03:43:04.309 --> 03:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
two years uh that permite the person
 
03:43:05.950 --> 03:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
who's gotten the the approval from the
 
03:43:07.870 --> 03:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
planning board engages in what's known
 
03:43:10.510 --> 03:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
as active and substantial development
 
03:43:12.110 --> 03:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
that is they actually moving ahead with
 
03:43:13.630 --> 03:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
the project doesn't mean they're they've
 
03:43:15.630 --> 03:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
completed it but they have engaged in
 
03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
active and substantial uh Improvement uh
 
03:43:20.429 --> 03:43:20.439 align:start position:0%
development in the first two years if
 
03:43:22.189 --> 03:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
they do that they get the full five
 
03:43:23.670 --> 03:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
years of
 
03:43:27.189 --> 03:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
protection if they if within the five
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
years uh they have the the uh developer
 
03:43:34.590 --> 03:43:34.600 align:start position:0%
has done substantial completion of the
 
03:43:37.110 --> 03:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
improvements then that project is
 
03:43:40.189 --> 03:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
permanently protected under law this is
 
03:43:42.870 --> 03:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
a constitutional issue it's a the notion
 
03:43:46.630 --> 03:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
of Reliance backed expectations so if
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
you've invested in something based on
 
03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
what the government says you can do then
 
03:43:53.309 --> 03:43:53.319 align:start position:0%
you have a property right in what the
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
government has said you could do uh so
 
03:43:58.830 --> 03:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
that that protection becomes permanent
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
once a substantial completion has been
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
done by the developer um and that that's
 
03:44:06.469 --> 03:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
true within the five years that's true
 
03:44:09.149 --> 03:44:09.159 align:start position:0%
actually anytime that happens uh so
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's a really important precept to
 
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
keep in mind
 
03:44:16.750 --> 03:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
um what the bill proposes to do in
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
section one uh is to take out uh the the
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
existing law and replace it with this uh
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
permanent protection and I think it
 
03:44:26.590 --> 03:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
there is some confusion here with the
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
relationship with the between
 
03:44:30.030 --> 03:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
subdivision site plan and the building
 
03:44:32.269 --> 03:44:32.279 align:start position:0%
and fire codes uh and I think that does
 
03:44:36.149 --> 03:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
need to be worked out if the committee
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
does not want to move ahead with section
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
one I would profer a uh an alternative
 
03:44:45.349 --> 03:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
that I think would be really helpful and
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
that is to extend these
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
timelines uh it under the current
 
03:44:54.189 --> 03:44:54.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances with issues of Labor and
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
Supply chains and delays in financing
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
and overall economic uh conditions that
 
03:45:04.670 --> 03:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
come and go uh it may take more than two
 
03:45:07.389 --> 03:45:07.399 align:start position:0%
years for someone to get a project off
 
03:45:09.349 --> 03:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
the ground so that they get that full
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
five your vesting um this is something
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has dealt with
 
03:45:18.070 --> 03:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
before in 2011 the legislature changed
 
03:45:21.309 --> 03:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh this statute from uh a four-year
 
03:45:24.030 --> 03:45:24.040 align:start position:0%
exemption with one year of active and
 
03:45:26.149 --> 03:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
substantial to the current two and
 
03:45:29.710 --> 03:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
fiveyear but also included within it a a
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
window that I'll call it the um the the
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession projects that is
 
03:45:37.389 --> 03:45:37.399 align:start position:0%
projects that were approved locally uh
 
03:45:39.910 --> 03:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
by a planning board between Jan January
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
1st 2007 and July 1st
 
03:45:45.630 --> 03:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
2009 that 2 and a half year period if
 
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
you if you approved locally during that
 
03:45:50.070 --> 03:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
two and a half year period you got three
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
and six
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
years I don't know what the magic number
 
03:45:55.950 --> 03:45:55.960 align:start position:0%
is but I would suggest that five years
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
to achieve uh active and substantial uh
 
03:46:04.269 --> 03:46:04.279 align:start position:0%
uh development and 10 years to re uh
 
03:46:06.469 --> 03:46:06.479 align:start position:0%
achieve substantial completion would be
 
03:46:08.590 --> 03:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
an appropriate uh
 
03:46:11.429 --> 03:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
remedy have to take any questions thank
 
03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
viell thank you for uh your testimony it
 
03:46:21.830 --> 03:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
seemed like at the very beginning you
 
03:46:27.070 --> 03:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
were um suggesting that the when the
 
03:46:32.030 --> 03:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
government says you're approved for this
 
03:46:34.590 --> 03:46:34.600 align:start position:0%
subdivision that you should be improved
 
03:46:37.349 --> 03:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
for that subdivision and that plan going
 
03:46:40.030 --> 03:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
forward and then at the end end of your
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
testimony you're saying well maybe you
 
03:46:44.389 --> 03:46:44.399 align:start position:0%
could be approved but only for five
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
years uh or 10 years and
 
03:46:53.429 --> 03:46:53.439 align:start position:0%
so is do you have a is there am I right
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
in that in congruity or do you have a
 
03:47:00.429 --> 03:47:00.439 align:start position:0%
preference one way or the other um and I
 
03:47:02.990 --> 03:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
just didn't catch it in your testimony
 
03:47:04.349 --> 03:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and this is
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
this is a a common um
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding among local planning
 
03:47:14.070 --> 03:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
board members what this statute means uh
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
lots of local planning board members
 
03:47:19.189 --> 03:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
think it means um that the approvals are
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
only good for five years and that is not
 
03:47:26.309 --> 03:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
the case uh it's a matter of of how
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
future zoning changes and other local
 
03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes impact upon an
 
03:47:33.710 --> 03:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
approval it doesn't mean the approval
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
expires so even a a a say let's say a a
 
03:47:39.870 --> 03:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
20 lot subdivision is approved by a
 
03:47:43.990 --> 03:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
planning board and nothing happens for
 
03:47:47.950 --> 03:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
six years that approval is still good uh
 
03:47:49.670 --> 03:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
but the zoning ordinance might have
 
03:47:52.030 --> 03:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
changed in a way that affects how that
 
03:47:54.189 --> 03:47:54.199 align:start position:0%
development would proceed uh and that
 
03:47:58.030 --> 03:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
development under current law uh because
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
the property owner for whatever reason
 
03:48:02.550 --> 03:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
did not proceed with it would then be
 
03:48:05.870 --> 03:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
subject to those changes in zoning uh
 
03:48:08.750 --> 03:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the current law is uh
 
03:48:11.550 --> 03:48:11.560 align:start position:0%
approvals do not planning board
 
03:48:13.950 --> 03:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
approvals do not expire zoning board
 
03:48:16.469 --> 03:48:16.479 align:start position:0%
issues are an entirely different issue
 
03:48:18.269 --> 03:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
statutorily uh but planning board
 
03:48:20.910 --> 03:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
approvals for subdivisions and site
 
03:48:23.149 --> 03:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
plans do not
 
03:48:25.149 --> 03:48:25.159 align:start position:0%
expire so any other questions
 
03:48:25.159 --> 03:48:26.910 align:start position:0%
expire so any other questions
representative

03:48:26.910 --> 03:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:30.910 --> 03:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um just to be sure that
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
I I understand um if uh the uh developer
 
03:48:40.510 --> 03:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
receives approval and uh reaches a
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
certain stage um and maybe um in a
 
03:48:45.469 --> 03:48:45.479 align:start position:0%
moment you can tell us what stage that
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
is within five years um then uh changes
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
that were made uh within those 5 years
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh would not uh that the developer would
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
not be required to comply with those
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
changes uh but if that stage were not
 
03:49:05.110 --> 03:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
reached within 5 years then changes that
 
03:49:08.110 --> 03:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
were enacted after the 5-year period the
 
03:49:09.790 --> 03:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
developer would be require ired to
 
03:49:12.469 --> 03:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
comply am I right about that yes
 
03:49:14.590 --> 03:49:14.600 align:start position:0%
representative G I think that is an
 
03:49:17.510 --> 03:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
accurate recitation of the current law
 
03:49:20.790 --> 03:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh and note that these are those stages
 
03:49:23.309 --> 03:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
as you call them whether it's active and
 
03:49:25.950 --> 03:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
substantial development or substantial
 
03:49:27.710 --> 03:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
completion of the improvements those are
 
03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
the two uh St parts of the statute those
 
03:49:35.110 --> 03:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
can either be defined by a planning
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
board on a Case by casee basis as that
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
is an approval by approval basis or they
 
03:49:41.429 --> 03:49:41.439 align:start position:0%
can be defined in the planning board's
 
03:49:43.670 --> 03:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
regulations the subdivision or site plan
 
03:49:46.349 --> 03:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
regulations as the case may be which
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
stage does the 5year exemption apply to
 
03:49:52.229 --> 03:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
that applies to uh having achieved
 
03:49:54.790 --> 03:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
substantial completions of improvements
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
shown on the plant that is the language
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
of the statute and that would mean for a
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
subdivision it doesn't mean building the
 
03:50:03.429 --> 03:50:03.439 align:start position:0%
homes because those AR it what it mean
 
03:50:04.670 --> 03:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's not what the planning board has
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
approved it means putting in a road
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
laying down the utilities that's those
 
03:50:11.630 --> 03:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
are the improvements to which that
 
03:50:11.640 --> 03:50:14.030 align:start position:0%
are the improvements to which that
statute

03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
refers okay thank you for your testimony
 
03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
oh my apologies representative
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
Amon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question which not quite sure
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
how to ask this
 
03:50:32.429 --> 03:50:32.439 align:start position:0%
but trying to better understand that
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
substantial completion within five years
 
03:50:37.229 --> 03:50:37.239 align:start position:0%
and your statement a few moments ago
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
that if that had been accomplished
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
then the developer was permanently is
 
03:50:43.120 --> 03:50:44.990 align:start position:0%
then the developer was permanently is
permanently

03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
permanently
 
03:50:47.590 --> 03:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
protected and relating that to
 
03:50:50.149 --> 03:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace's
 
03:50:52.750 --> 03:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
situation with the imposition of
 
03:50:55.550 --> 03:50:55.560 align:start position:0%
sprinkler requirement when it sounds
 
03:50:58.590 --> 03:50:58.600 align:start position:0%
like substantial completion
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
had been accomplished can you just weigh
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
in on that thank yes representative ban
 
03:51:08.189 --> 03:51:08.199 align:start position:0%
and and the the issue is that uh the
 
03:51:10.590 --> 03:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
current law in RSA
 
03:51:14.950 --> 03:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
67439 addresses only zoning and
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
subdivision and site plan regulations it
 
03:51:23.309 --> 03:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.990 --> 03:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
codes thank
 
03:51:38.149 --> 03:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:41.110 --> 03:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you chairman uh committee
 
03:51:43.309 --> 03:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
members uh for the record my name is
 
03:51:45.189 --> 03:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
Gary Abbott I'm the Executive Vice
 
03:51:47.429 --> 03:51:47.439 align:start position:0%
President of the associated general
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
contractors of New Hampshire I represent
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial uh
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
contractors and I come to you today
 
03:51:58.149 --> 03:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
because I am so glad I followed Ben
 
03:52:01.510 --> 03:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
Frost um because I think our group had
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
issues with this I actually brought it
 
03:52:05.349 --> 03:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
to my board of directors yesterday I
 
03:52:07.630 --> 03:52:07.640 align:start position:0%
brought it to them back in January
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the B and I think
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
they understand the current law they
 
03:52:15.550 --> 03:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
understand what Ben talked about as far
 
03:52:17.910 --> 03:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
as zoning and how long to get your
 
03:52:20.309 --> 03:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
commercial project up and running and to
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
be protected from future zoning and
 
03:52:27.630 --> 03:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
changes in land use so we understand the
 
03:52:29.830 --> 03:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
five-year process that you just that Ben
 
03:52:31.429 --> 03:52:31.439 align:start position:0%
just explained to
 
03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
you and I agree with Ben that if you
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to do in the language is
 
03:52:40.830 --> 03:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
extend the years I agree with if there's
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
problems meeting the two-year provision
 
03:52:45.870 --> 03:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
or the five-year provision maybe making
 
03:52:48.149 --> 03:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
those adjustments to be more reasonable
 
03:52:50.710 --> 03:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
in today's market I think is probably a
 
03:52:53.550 --> 03:52:53.560 align:start position:0%
plus because my group of course said we
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
like the current process we can live
 
03:52:57.830 --> 03:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
with it we know there's some hiccups
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor is trying to fix but at
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
the current moment we we don't want to
 
03:53:04.349 --> 03:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
mess with the system too much but I
 
03:53:06.429 --> 03:53:06.439 align:start position:0%
think Ben's recommendation kind of goes
 
03:53:08.349 --> 03:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
in that direction where you can get a
 
03:53:08.359 --> 03:53:09.750 align:start position:0%
in that direction where you can get a
compromise

03:53:09.750 --> 03:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
03:53:12.429 --> 03:53:12.439 align:start position:0%
the building codes uh clearly I've been
 
03:53:14.110 --> 03:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
very involved with the building codes
 
03:53:16.630 --> 03:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the fire codes for many many years
 
03:53:19.070 --> 03:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
over here and I just want to run you
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
through the process of a Commercial
 
03:53:23.070 --> 03:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
contractor he's going to hire a designer
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
to design his building whatever that's
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
going to be and they're going to design
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
it to the the code they're going to look
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
at what the municipal amendments are and
 
03:53:33.830 --> 03:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to design that building
 
03:53:35.870 --> 03:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
and go through the municipal process to
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
get that approved and I agree with the
 
03:53:38.399 --> 03:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
get that approved and I agree with the
sponsor

03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:53:41.670 --> 03:53:41.680 align:start position:0%
once you've met those conditions and
 
03:53:44.110 --> 03:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
you've met those codes we used to have
 
03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
this a lot what the sponsor was talking
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
about where somebody in the field would
 
03:53:50.349 --> 03:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
have a different idea or a different
 
03:53:52.910 --> 03:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation we've clearly moved on
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
from that about five years ago it was a
 
03:54:00.149 --> 03:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
major effort that those codes that or
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
changes in the codes at the municipal
 
03:54:05.070 --> 03:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
level need to be done
 
03:54:08.349 --> 03:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
legally through the legal authority of
 
03:54:10.750 --> 03:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
the min IP ality whether it's either a
 
03:54:13.670 --> 03:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
vote by the community a vote by the city
 
03:54:16.389 --> 03:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
council there needs to be documentation
 
03:54:18.630 --> 03:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need to be some official out
 
03:54:21.630 --> 03:54:21.640 align:start position:0%
there making up separate rules and
 
03:54:23.630 --> 03:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
regulations that are different than
 
03:54:25.870 --> 03:54:25.880 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
so in recent passage of different bills
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns are supposed to
 
03:54:36.269 --> 03:54:36.279 align:start position:0%
file those code changes with the State
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
Building Code review board it's already
 
03:54:40.990 --> 03:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
law it's already in but only four
 
03:54:44.030 --> 03:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
communities are doing it so there is
 
03:54:46.510 --> 03:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
real no record for the Commercial
 
03:54:48.910 --> 03:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
contractor coming in it would be a great
 
03:54:51.750 --> 03:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
to have the state have one resource
 
03:54:53.389 --> 03:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
where those amendments
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
are because they can make it more
 
03:54:57.349 --> 03:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
restrictive and I think your committee's
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
hit up on that which could be a problem
 
03:55:01.389 --> 03:55:01.399 align:start position:0%
under a number of items that you're
 
03:55:04.750 --> 03:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
talking about today but you understand
 
03:55:06.309 --> 03:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
this if somebody makes that
 
03:55:09.030 --> 03:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
determination in the field there is a an
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
appeals process for the interpretation
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the code or the change in the code
 
03:55:16.030 --> 03:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
that currently can go back to the
 
03:55:18.269 --> 03:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
building code review board because there
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
are those disputes I do have contractors
 
03:55:22.790 --> 03:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
that say hey we don't interpret it that
 
03:55:24.189 --> 03:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
way we haven't done it that way in the
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
last three projects those changes so we
 
03:55:30.550 --> 03:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
have a good system in place but I do
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
agree Senate Bill 437 that's coming is
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
trying to tighten those screws down on
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
City and town compliance and going to
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
too far beyond adopting codes if we're
 
03:55:43.950 --> 03:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
if we're adopting 2021 hopefully this
 
03:55:46.510 --> 03:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
year and there's only 2024 that's not
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
even completed and out we're up to date
 
03:55:51.750 --> 03:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't understand municipalities
 
03:55:54.990 --> 03:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to adopt more stringent codes or
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
more different codes the other part of
 
03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
that is anybody can build to a higher
 
03:56:04.110 --> 03:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency do anything they want
 
03:56:06.030 --> 03:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
the issue is here of the authority of
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
telling private businesses private
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
commercial developments to do that that
 
03:56:14.870 --> 03:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
becomes a question we think it should be
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
the owner's choice in these towns that
 
03:56:20.110 --> 03:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
get up and say oh we do something more
 
03:56:22.469 --> 03:56:22.479 align:start position:0%
restrictive we look at it and this is
 
03:56:25.469 --> 03:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
where your concern is for housing your
 
03:56:27.750 --> 03:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
your mandating costs and I've got
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
commercial builders that will s tell you
 
03:56:32.710 --> 03:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
you mandate some of those things how
 
03:56:35.269 --> 03:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
quickly is the payback and today with
 
03:56:37.630 --> 03:56:37.640 align:start position:0%
interest rates the payback's going to be
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
a lot longer if you have to invest uh
 
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
money into that project through a
 
03:56:44.269 --> 03:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
financial institution with the current
 
03:56:46.469 --> 03:56:46.479 align:start position:0%
rates so we're in agreement with what
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
the committee's trying to do here um but
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
I do think listening to Ben Frost and if
 
03:56:54.910 --> 03:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
those added years because you want
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are going to want some
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
protection that somebody doesn't go
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%
forward with the development at all and
 
03:57:02.149 --> 03:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
we don't really want to see that either
 
03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
that it's open-ended forever but we
 
03:57:06.269 --> 03:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
think we've got a good process and I
 
03:57:08.030 --> 03:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
hope this committee will support some of
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
these Senate bills that are coming over
 
03:57:11.870 --> 03:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
that trying to tighten down the
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
regulations and kind of push cities and
 
03:57:16.710 --> 03:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
towns to file their amendments because I
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
think some amendments could be in
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
violation of some of the other things
 
03:57:22.910 --> 03:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
the state has passed or in violation of
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
the code with that I know you're running
 
03:57:27.910 --> 03:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
so late uh I appreciate it hearing my
 
03:57:30.510 --> 03:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh would hope that maybe
 
03:57:32.229 --> 03:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
tweak this a little
 
03:57:34.550 --> 03:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
bit all right any questions for Mr
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
Abbott represent VI P hi thank you thank
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question it seemed
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
from your testimony that if the planning
 
03:57:50.670 --> 03:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
board comes to is presented this
 
03:57:53.710 --> 03:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
subdivision with this road going here um
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
and approves
 
03:58:00.030 --> 03:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
it and let's say the the developer
 
03:58:03.429 --> 03:58:03.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't start for 11
 
03:58:08.149 --> 03:58:08.159 align:start position:0%
years um but and in the meantime they've
 
03:58:10.590 --> 03:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
changed some regulations saying that now
 
03:58:14.750 --> 03:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
the road needs to go somewhere else that
 
03:58:19.550 --> 03:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're you would prefer that that that
 
03:58:21.389 --> 03:58:21.399 align:start position:0%
even though it got approved before that
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
that person now be subject to that new
 
03:58:27.630 --> 03:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
road requirement instead of uh the one
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
that actually got approved because this
 
03:58:33.070 --> 03:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
this language in the bill is essentially
 
03:58:35.510 --> 03:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
forever that if that road got approved
 
03:58:38.070 --> 03:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
to go in that way then you can build it
 
03:58:39.750 --> 03:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
that way it doesn't matter if they
 
03:58:41.830 --> 03:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
change it in 5 years or 10 years if you
 
03:58:44.830 --> 03:58:44.840 align:start position:0%
start that that subdivision whenever you
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
start it that approval follows you and
 
03:58:49.910 --> 03:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that no it should only
 
03:58:52.670 --> 03:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
follow you for a certain amount of time
 
03:58:54.750 --> 03:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
um it seemed like in your testimony is
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
that my correct understanding of of your
 
03:58:59.830 --> 03:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation you're correct because
 
03:59:02.670 --> 03:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
I've been in other hearings and meetings
 
03:59:04.349 --> 03:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
where towns have complained about
 
03:59:07.110 --> 03:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
contractors not starting projects and
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of issues with that
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
with delaying to like 11 years that that
 
03:59:14.870 --> 03:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
could be a major problem of getting a
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
permit and holding off for 11 years so
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'm cautioning even though I represent
 
03:59:21.309 --> 03:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
an industry that you would probably
 
03:59:24.750 --> 03:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
think yeah we'd like forever uh even the
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
developers I think there's got to be a
 
03:59:28.429 --> 03:59:28.439 align:start position:0%
balance so I guess that's what I'm
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
putting on the table is I I think you
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
want to be fair to the whole process and
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
I think you have to be understanding I
 
03:59:39.710 --> 03:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
guess what we we recognize contractors
 
03:59:42.189 --> 03:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to be too far back in codes
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
and those kind of things because of the
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
liability um we supported the Statewide
 
03:59:50.550 --> 03:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
building code initially in the 90s
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
because we did not want towns towns had
 
03:59:56.269 --> 03:59:56.279 align:start position:0%
codes that were 15 years old the
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
liability for the contractor not to be
 
04:00:01.469 --> 04:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
building to the latest code was a
 
04:00:03.750 --> 04:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
problem I think some of those issues
 
04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
might happen in land use as well I'm not
 
04:00:08.830 --> 04:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
big on land use that's why I like Ben
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
Frost talking about plann use but I
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
think that's some of the issues we have
 
04:00:15.790 --> 04:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
that we don't talk about that we're
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
concerned not to be too far back in
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
codes because then you have liability
 
04:00:21.710 --> 04:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
issue for
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
structural okay I hope that answered
 
04:00:24.120 --> 04:00:25.429 align:start position:0%
structural okay I hope that answered
your

04:00:25.429 --> 04:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
question thank you for your testimony
 
04:00:37.309 --> 04:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.319 --> 04:00:39.870 align:start position:0%
 
cream

04:00:39.870 --> 04:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
cream
 
04:00:43.510 --> 04:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
Jeffrey K from NASA um actually one
 
04:00:44.990 --> 04:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
thing I you know wanted to go back here
 
04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
on was there was a talk about the RSA
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
155 A2 having a lockin thing which is
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
true and I see it there but that applies
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
to the state and some of the things in
 
04:00:55.630 --> 04:00:55.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um are trying to make sure
 
04:00:57.269 --> 04:00:57.279 align:start position:0%
they apply to municipalities in terms of
 
04:00:58.750 --> 04:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances we already had someone
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
earlier talk about how in Durham we
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't even use building CES we just pass
 
04:01:03.950 --> 04:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
an ordinance to do certain things right
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
so I I think the protections provided by
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
this will are important so I should say
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
gu I support the Bill thank you um you
 
04:01:13.710 --> 04:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
know a practical sense it provides
 
04:01:15.469 --> 04:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
certainty for projects and reduces risks
 
04:01:17.070 --> 04:01:17.080 align:start position:0%
of abandoned projects that have already
 
04:01:18.349 --> 04:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
received financing or started
 
04:01:19.750 --> 04:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
construction or otherwise began
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
investment of time and money and puts
 
04:01:22.950 --> 04:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing projects in equal footing with
 
04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
existing structures provides Clarity to
 
04:01:26.710 --> 04:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
the planning boards and political
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions relative risks they may
 
04:01:30.149 --> 04:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
face if they were to attempt to impose
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
such changes uh representative Wallace
 
04:01:33.429 --> 04:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
already talked about the Superior New
 
04:01:34.790 --> 04:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution but the you know
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution also has sections on
 
04:01:38.990 --> 04:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
exposed facto laws so I guess I won't go
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
into all that but it's interesting that
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
as we you know we recognize the
 
04:01:45.030 --> 04:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive um clause in our
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the Expos fact those
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
but we ALS start talking about things
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
like 10 years five years like the
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution does sort of provide a
 
04:01:54.670 --> 04:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
pretty blanket um statement about uh
 
04:01:54.680 --> 04:01:56.790 align:start position:0%
pretty blanket um statement about uh
retroactive

04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
retroactive
 
04:02:02.149 --> 04:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
laws um if the legislature um intends to
 
04:02:04.030 --> 04:02:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'll that we were talked about that
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
um the bill provides explicit Clarity to
 
04:02:07.710 --> 04:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions that recor after
 
04:02:09.269 --> 04:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
changes can not be mandated I think
 
04:02:10.750 --> 04:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's important because it will reduce
 
04:02:13.469 --> 04:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
the risk of uh of lawsuits and I think
 
04:02:14.590 --> 04:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to know that nothing in
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
the bill prevents a political
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
subdivision for making non-bonding
 
04:02:19.309 --> 04:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
suggestions based upon updated rules or
 
04:02:20.710 --> 04:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances so in some cases it's
 
04:02:22.309 --> 04:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
plausible that uh there might be changes
 
04:02:23.910 --> 04:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
that have structural benefits or safety
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
benefits or life cycle cost um
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
reductions like there was talk about you
 
04:02:29.550 --> 04:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
know better better inflation it's going
 
04:02:31.110 --> 04:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
to pay for itself well if it's going to
 
04:02:32.870 --> 04:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
pay for itself what developer or
 
04:02:34.269 --> 04:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
homeowner is not going to want to do
 
04:02:36.750 --> 04:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
that right so um certainly nothing is
 
04:02:38.870 --> 04:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
preventing people from uh adopting those
 
04:02:38.880 --> 04:02:39.630 align:start position:0%
preventing people from uh adopting those
things

04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
voluntarily um and I guess that's it I
 
04:02:44.670 --> 04:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
don't want to repeat things
 
04:02:47.070 --> 04:02:47.080 align:start position:0%
relate oh thank you if you if you'd like
 
04:02:48.349 --> 04:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
to send us a copy of that that would be
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
helpful so we can read that on our own
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
as well send an email thank you for your
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions questions seeing
 
04:02:55.469 --> 04:02:55.479 align:start position:0%
none thank you very
 
04:02:58.510 --> 04:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
much okay um Ivy
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.080 --> 04:03:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
graze

04:03:12.070 --> 04:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair n Grace for the
 
04:03:16.229 --> 04:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh we do oppose
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
the legislation but uh based on the
 
04:03:21.550 --> 04:03:21.560 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard today um it sounds
 
04:03:25.030 --> 04:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
like uh Mr Frost Mr Abbott the Fire
 
04:03:26.950 --> 04:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
Marshall and I assume Mr Sherman would
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
all like to uh work together on an
 
04:03:31.870 --> 04:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
amendment we're happy to do so um some
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the suggestions that were made were
 
04:03:37.429 --> 04:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
to amend um some of the timelines that
 
04:03:39.269 --> 04:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
currently exist exist um and that's
 
04:03:41.070 --> 04:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
something that I think we can come to a
 
04:03:44.670 --> 04:03:44.680 align:start position:0%
compromise on um as as mentioned um
 
04:03:46.710 --> 04:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
there are some statutes like
 
04:03:50.389 --> 04:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
15582 one that would apply um and of
 
04:03:53.070 --> 04:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
course that applies in in the code world
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there is separately um the zoning
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision world and I think that Mr
 
04:04:02.309 --> 04:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
Frost explained that um quite well um so
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
I think there is a compromise that
 
04:04:05.590 --> 04:04:05.600 align:start position:0%
stakeholders can come and I'll just
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate that there have been pretty
 
04:04:08.630 --> 04:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
substantial changes in the building
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
World especially how we apply codes in
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
this state in the last few years so
 
04:04:16.030 --> 04:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
still working out some of those details
 
04:04:17.590 --> 04:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
but I'm confident that we can come
 
04:04:19.389 --> 04:04:19.399 align:start position:0%
together and make it all work better
 
04:04:21.510 --> 04:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
Happ to take any questions thank you for
 
04:04:23.750 --> 04:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there any questions
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
for n Mr gracek thank you for your
 
04:04:30.830 --> 04:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
testimony okay um there were two people
 
04:04:32.349 --> 04:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
signed up that are no longer in the room
 
04:04:34.309 --> 04:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
so with that is there anybody else that
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
wish to test fire on hp1
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
1215 okay so with that that I'm going to
 
04:04:41.349 --> 04:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HP 1215 and
 
04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
we are going to take a 5 minute recess
 
04:05:06.870 --> 04:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:06.880 --> 04:12:55.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll call on the prime sponsor
 
04:12:57.479 --> 04:12:59.269 align:start position:0%
and we'll call on the prime sponsor
representative

04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
Alexander who's in supported a bill I am
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
House special committee on housing for
 
04:13:08.070 --> 04:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Joe Alexander I
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
represent the town of gtown which is
 
04:13:15.229 --> 04:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro District 29 so first of all
 
04:13:18.349 --> 04:13:18.359 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking on HB 1361 but I also have
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I have passed around
 
04:13:22.030 --> 04:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
to the committee that basically replaces
 
04:13:23.229 --> 04:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
bill um so there are extra copies for
 
04:13:27.269 --> 04:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
members of the public that would like to
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
look at it um I I kind of want to zoom
 
04:13:33.830 --> 04:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
back and talk about we spent eight
 
04:13:36.309 --> 04:13:36.319 align:start position:0%
months as a committee really like honing
 
04:13:38.189 --> 04:13:38.199 align:start position:0%
down on what are specific needs of the
 
04:13:42.510 --> 04:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
state what we're lacking um and and we
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
try to identify key issues in this in
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
this space to try to move the ball
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
forward and and and I I have the firm
 
04:13:51.830 --> 04:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
belief that this of course is a supply
 
04:13:53.550 --> 04:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
side issue I just don't think we have
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
enough units um and I think that the
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
units that are being built are almost
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
always or or or the ones that are the
 
04:14:03.309 --> 04:14:03.319 align:start position:0%
most economical for people to build
 
04:14:05.309 --> 04:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
because of the environment are single
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
family residences and single family
 
04:14:08.670 --> 04:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
neighborhood these are the these are the
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
ones that are the most um financially
 
04:14:14.349 --> 04:14:14.359 align:start position:0%
advantageous for for developers to build
 
04:14:18.269 --> 04:14:18.279 align:start position:0%
so this bill would basically clarify um
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
the RSA around municipal or around
 
04:14:21.319 --> 04:14:22.550 align:start position:0%
the RSA around municipal or around
manufactured

04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
04:14:25.469 --> 04:14:25.479 align:start position:0%
housing I think the key the key missing
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
piece in this entire puzzle is that
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
there are not enough units at an
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
affordable price and this is really a
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
transition to getting New Hampshire with
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
enough units out of affordable prices so
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
um to put it in perspective I purchased
 
04:14:44.710 --> 04:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
a townhouse in 2017 in Goffstown and it
 
04:14:48.389 --> 04:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
was priced at 160 I I bought it I think
 
04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
at the time six grand over asking and it
 
04:14:50.479 --> 04:14:51.229 align:start position:0%
at the time six grand over asking and it
was

04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
$166,000 and back then I was like oh my
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
God that's a lot of money I'm like wow
 
04:14:57.550 --> 04:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
and all I did was sit on the thing for
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
six years and now we're at the point
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
where my house is doubled in value and
 
04:15:04.910 --> 04:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
if I came if I tried to buy a townhouse
 
04:15:08.429 --> 04:15:08.439 align:start position:0%
in gown for1 166 ,000 I mean
 
04:15:09.870 --> 04:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy's a realtor I think
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
he'd tell me he'd be like maybe you
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
should like up your price a little bit
 
04:15:35.990 --> 04:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
overregulation who got a graduate degree
 
04:15:42.349 --> 04:15:42.359 align:start position:0%
moved moved into a house um could afford
 
04:15:44.070 --> 04:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
to buy a house instead of get stuck in
 
04:15:46.950 --> 04:15:46.960 align:start position:0%
the cycle of $2,000 rent a month unable
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
to afford a down payment they could have
 
04:15:50.990 --> 04:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that key to home ownership which is I
 
04:15:52.269 --> 04:15:52.279 align:start position:0%
believe strongly is the key to the
 
04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
middle class this would allow us the
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that so this is not
 
04:15:59.030 --> 04:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
just a bill that will affect young
 
04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
people I think this is a bill that would
 
04:16:02.750 --> 04:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
help people that are looking to downsize
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
elderly may have a smaller family at a
 
04:16:06.309 --> 04:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
point in their life and they decide you
 
04:16:08.790 --> 04:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
know what it's time I'd like to retire
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
into a community that works for me um
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
you know hearing the
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
compelling presentation from this
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
morning this might be a space where
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
people with developmental disabilities
 
04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
get to be in a community that with an
 
04:16:25.990 --> 04:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
affordable home at a decent price um a
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
lot of these manufactured housing are
 
04:16:30.830 --> 04:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
housing units are energy efficient um
 
04:16:32.389 --> 04:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
but they're they're affordable by and
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
large and again if there's people
 
04:16:36.269 --> 04:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about property taxes or
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that that like this is a
 
04:16:41.109 --> 04:16:41.119 align:start position:0%
going to provide a decent um property
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
tax relief as well by having one of
 
04:16:45.870 --> 04:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
these units so um with that there's a
 
04:16:47.550 --> 04:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
bunch of people behind me that are ready
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
to testify in support of this so I hope
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
that um you'll refer a lot of the
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
complicated questions to them but I hope
 
04:16:55.630 --> 04:16:55.640 align:start position:0%
I gave you a strong compelling story of
 
04:16:57.790 --> 04:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
why I believe this is the missing piece
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
of the puzzle so thank you thank you and
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
U go thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:17:06.000 --> 04:17:07.510 align:start position:0%
U go thank you thank you for taking the
question

04:17:07.510 --> 04:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
um it on line 9 and 10 of your Amendment
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
um it says a municipality that adopts
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
land use control measures shall allow in
 
04:17:23.349 --> 04:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
its sole discretion manufactured housing
 
04:17:28.109 --> 04:17:28.119 align:start position:0%
to be located it seems like the that
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
language is trying to require that they
 
04:17:34.269 --> 04:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
allow it but it also seems like it's
 
04:17:37.790 --> 04:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
saying that nope they can just allow it
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
in their sole discretion or not in their
 
04:17:43.950 --> 04:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
sole discretion um is the purpose of
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation to require
 
04:17:46.560 --> 04:17:48.309 align:start position:0%
this legislation to require
municipalities

04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
to um allow or is it to essentially
 
04:17:55.790 --> 04:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
allow flexibility that they can or
 
04:17:58.950 --> 04:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
cannot allow uh the light the
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing thank you yeah well
 
04:18:02.870 --> 04:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I would say
 
04:18:05.189 --> 04:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is an effort to be clear but not so
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
clear if if this makes sense with
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities need to afford a
 
04:18:11.109 --> 04:18:11.119 align:start position:0%
reasonable and real realistic
 
04:18:12.269 --> 04:18:12.279 align:start position:0%
opportunities for citing and
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing we found um we had
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
a presentation by Sansom College last
 
04:18:19.229 --> 04:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
year the zoning Atlas about you know if
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
you filter out how many municipalities
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
allow Zoning for manufactured housing
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's such a small small small amount of
 
04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
landspace that's available so um I want
 
04:18:30.750 --> 04:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that municipalities are
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
looking at this at in a reasonable way
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
so you're saying it's not clear I mean
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
it it it isn't clear I mean it's not
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to tell you like you must do it
 
04:18:42.389 --> 04:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
but I think the RSA needs to state that
 
04:18:43.910 --> 04:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
you need to look at you need to at least
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
look at it entertain the idea um for
 
04:18:48.399 --> 04:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
look at it entertain the idea um for
that

04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
followup I think it's my understanding
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
that the current law already requires
 
04:18:59.070 --> 04:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
that they allow it in some
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
form um but the the problem is that they
 
04:19:05.149 --> 04:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
may only allow it in manufactured
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
housing Parks but there's no room for a
 
04:19:09.830 --> 04:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing park or whatever in
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
their town and so they you know they
 
04:19:15.429 --> 04:19:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't allow it on a single single family
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
lot and so it seems like we are not
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
going anywhere with this legislation um
 
04:19:24.630 --> 04:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering if you would be
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
open to saying like you have to
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
essentially anywhere that
 
04:19:32.550 --> 04:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
it's you allow a single family house
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
that you could uh you should be allowed
 
04:19:37.389 --> 04:19:37.399 align:start position:0%
to have a manufact factured single
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
family house um would that be amendable
 
04:19:42.870 --> 04:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
to you I'm going to refer that question
 
04:19:44.510 --> 04:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
to the people behind me okay thanks
 
04:19:47.149 --> 04:19:47.159 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anyone else
 
04:19:47.159 --> 04:19:48.269 align:start position:0%
thank you okay anyone else
representative

04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:53.670 --> 04:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.070 --> 04:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
so so following up on representative
 
04:19:59.309 --> 04:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
Ella's question just to confirm what I
 
04:20:01.149 --> 04:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
think you just
 
04:20:01.159 --> 04:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
think you just
said

04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:20:08.630 --> 04:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
um the section from line 9 through line
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
19 is not intended to say that a
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
municipality would choose at least one
 
04:20:17.910 --> 04:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
of these options it's simply intended to
 
04:20:19.990 --> 04:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
say these are options that you should
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
entertain is that correct
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
correct would you be open to an
 
04:20:26.149 --> 04:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that says a municipality shall
 
04:20:28.750 --> 04:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
choose one of these options the the bill
 
04:20:30.870 --> 04:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
is in the hands of the
 
04:20:33.830 --> 04:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I am one member of it
 
04:20:42.070 --> 04:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:42.080 --> 04:20:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
Lorenzo

04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo
 
04:20:44.040 --> 04:20:47.309 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo
oh

04:20:47.309 --> 04:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative Del
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo uh yes um when I first read uh
 
04:20:56.389 --> 04:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
this bill um and became a co-sponsor of
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
it I thought that I understood um that
 
04:21:06.750 --> 04:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
the um provision was that uh manufactur
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
housing must be allowed in some form um
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
and that the in its sole discretion
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
applied only to how it shall be how it
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
shall be allowed so but now I'm I'm
 
04:21:22.030 --> 04:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
hearing that I might have been wrong
 
04:21:24.830 --> 04:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
about that that in fact it can be
 
04:21:26.830 --> 04:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
disallowed thank you for the question if
 
04:21:32.309 --> 04:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
to I on which version uh of the
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm looking at Line 6 to8 it
 
04:21:42.030 --> 04:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
says um municipalities shall not exclud
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and manufactured
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
housing Parts in subdivisions completely
 
04:21:49.070 --> 04:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
from municipality by regulation zoning
 
04:21:53.389 --> 04:21:53.399 align:start position:0%
ordinance or any or any other police
 
04:21:56.070 --> 04:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
power so therefore the in its sole
 
04:21:58.670 --> 04:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
discretion does apply only to how they
 
04:22:01.590 --> 04:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
do it not whether they do it yes thank
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you and U representative
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:07.149 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you and U representative
Damon

04:22:07.149 --> 04:22:07.159 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
04:22:08.790 --> 04:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:22:11.550 --> 04:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
so obviously as a co-sponsor I support
 
04:22:13.990 --> 04:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
this bill I support it very much and the
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is much clearer formatting
 
04:22:19.790 --> 04:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
than the original bill so thank you I'm
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
looking for whether we have somewhere in
 
04:22:25.830 --> 04:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
statute that I don't know about um
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
definitions of reasonable and realistic
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
as with the languages here more than
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
once and I find that language vague yeah
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
and and I and from my experience as a
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislator and I'm not a lawyer and I I
 
04:22:41.910 --> 04:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
do make $100 a year I don't know if you
 
04:22:45.710 --> 04:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
know that so um I I'm not a pro with
 
04:22:47.469 --> 04:22:47.479 align:start position:0%
this stuff but what I can tell you is
 
04:22:49.229 --> 04:22:49.239 align:start position:0%
that typically when we put reasonable
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
and realistic in there we use it in a um
 
04:22:55.910 --> 04:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
a a way that provides the judicial
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
branch some flexibility because I think
 
04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
the general public can say what they
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
feel is reasonable and what I feel is
 
04:23:07.950 --> 04:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
realistic I believe most people can say
 
04:23:09.670 --> 04:23:09.680 align:start position:0%
this is a reasonable ordinance or this
 
04:23:11.269 --> 04:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
is an unreasonable ordinance and a lot
 
04:23:17.070 --> 04:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
interpretation okay anyone
 
04:23:22.469 --> 04:23:22.479 align:start position:0%
else question I'm in to thank Mr
 
04:23:25.830 --> 04:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
chairman um and um Mr Alexander
 
04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander um perhaps I
 
04:23:32.269 --> 04:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
should hold my questions online 27 to 32
 
04:23:35.269 --> 04:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
for someone else uh unless you'd like to
 
04:23:37.109 --> 04:23:37.119 align:start position:0%
address those
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
I um so my my question I think I think
 
04:23:41.790 --> 04:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
that's yeah if you want to hold off on
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%

chairman uh we'll call Nathaniel Z

for House Bill
 
04:25:05.710 --> 04:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
1361 with the proposed amendment because
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
it will create more opportunities for
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families to achieve the
 
04:25:11.229 --> 04:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
American dream of home
 
04:25:13.389 --> 04:25:13.399 align:start position:0%
ownership when my New Hampshire
 
04:25:15.109 --> 04:25:15.119 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund colleagues presented
 
04:25:17.710 --> 04:25:17.720 align:start position:0%
to this committee last June we shared
 
04:25:20.389 --> 04:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
some very exciting information New
 
04:25:22.990 --> 04:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents can own their own
 
04:25:25.229 --> 04:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
manufactured home at a lower monthly
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
cost than renting an apartment of the
 
04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
same size the New Hampshire Community
 
04:25:31.790 --> 04:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund is one of few lenders that
 
04:25:34.590 --> 04:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
offers Fair fixed rate 30-year mortgages
 
04:25:38.189 --> 04:25:38.199 align:start position:0%
on manufactured homes we also offer 0%
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
loans for families with very low incomes
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
to cover down payment and closing costs
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine demand is
 
04:25:47.830 --> 04:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
skyrocketing during our last fiscal year
 
04:25:49.790 --> 04:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
we pre-qualified more than 700
 
04:25:51.990 --> 04:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
households for manufactured home
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
mortgages but like other forms of
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire there is not
 
04:25:58.349 --> 04:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
enough Supply to meet demand and we were
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
only able to finance and find and
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
finance about a 100 homes for families
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
last year House Bill 1361 with the
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment is a clarification of
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
existing law that could create more of
 
04:26:11.710 --> 04:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
these affordable home ownership
 
04:26:13.429 --> 04:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
opportunities through the development
 
04:26:16.870 --> 04:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
and expansion of manufactured home parks
 
04:26:18.429 --> 04:26:18.439 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes are the perfect
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
option for both firsttime home buyers
 
04:26:22.830 --> 04:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
and those ready to downsize adding to
 
04:26:24.830 --> 04:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
their supply will open the supply of
 
04:26:26.870 --> 04:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
traditional stick-built single family
 
04:26:27.910 --> 04:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
homes as
 
04:26:30.349 --> 04:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
well there are currently about 400
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks around New
 
04:26:34.269 --> 04:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the smallest has four homes
 
04:26:36.950 --> 04:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
and the largest in exiter has three
 
04:26:39.389 --> 04:26:39.399 align:start position:0%
397 but the average Community contains
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
50 to 55 families residents of these
 
04:26:44.309 --> 04:26:44.319 align:start position:0%
Parks may have lower incomes but they
 
04:26:46.389 --> 04:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
are important members of our community
 
04:26:48.830 --> 04:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
and vital to our economy cities and
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
towns across the state would have a hard
 
04:26:52.149 --> 04:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
time functioning without the essential
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
workers Who call these Parks home and
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
modern manufactured home communities are
 
04:26:59.349 --> 04:26:59.359 align:start position:0%

wealth building for low and moderate
 
04:27:30.349 --> 04:27:30.359 align:start position:0%

their acceptance and appreciation and
 
04:27:33.790 --> 04:27:33.800 align:start position:0%

please vote to pass House Bill
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
1361 with the proposed amendment thank
 
04:27:55.189 --> 04:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:57.510 --> 04:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
M thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:28:00.910 --> 04:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
question you you talked in your
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is a clarification
 
04:28:08.109 --> 04:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
of the current law already on the books
 
04:28:10.229 --> 04:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
and I kind of alluded to that in my
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
previous question I
 
04:28:17.830 --> 04:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
am interested in your interpretation of
 
04:28:20.550 --> 04:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
what exactly you think that it
 
04:28:20.560 --> 04:28:22.349 align:start position:0%
what exactly you think that it
clarifies

04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
04:28:28.710 --> 04:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and how you believe that the that
 
04:28:33.309 --> 04:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
this change might um encourage
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
more availability for place of new
 
04:28:42.510 --> 04:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
either single or or development cluster
 
04:28:44.149 --> 04:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
kind of developments according to
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
current law no municipality can can can
 
04:28:50.910 --> 04:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
um eliminate manufactured homes at all
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
right you have to allow for manufactured
 
04:28:55.429 --> 04:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
homes this expands that to reasonable
 
04:28:56.830 --> 04:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
and realistic opportunities for the
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
sighting of both manufactured homes and
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions so it adds that
 
04:29:01.520 --> 04:29:03.189 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions so it adds that
language

04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
in it also if you look down at
 
04:29:06.479 --> 04:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
in it also if you look down at
e

04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
um e says municipalities show allow
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable and realistic opportunities
 
04:29:15.990 --> 04:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
for the expansion of manufactured
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
housing Parks existing as of July 1
 
04:29:21.070 --> 04:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
that's also
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
new right now there's about 300 vacant
 
04:29:26.910 --> 04:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
Lots in um at least in the Resident
 
04:29:28.109 --> 04:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
owned communities that we work with
 
04:29:29.670 --> 04:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's 300 vacant Lots around New
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and sometimes you know there
 
04:29:33.990 --> 04:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
was a house there that needed to be
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
removed or someone abandoned in a home
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
and to place a new home there sometimes
 
04:29:42.189 --> 04:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
the rocks have to go through the zoning
 
04:29:44.269 --> 04:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
process the local zoning process and can
 
04:29:47.469 --> 04:29:47.479 align:start position:0%
be denied to place a home in a on a lot
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
existed thank you for your yes that
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
would be great um it so you're you're
 
04:30:02.670 --> 04:30:02.680 align:start position:0%
speaking to line six where it says you
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
have to be able to allow sighting of
 
04:30:06.550 --> 04:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and and
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks and
 
04:30:13.149 --> 04:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and um however then it goes
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
on to like B where it's like you can mix
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
and match all of these things it it
 
04:30:18.479 --> 04:30:19.590 align:start position:0%
and match all of these things it it
seems

04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
seems
 
04:30:19.600 --> 04:30:23.429 align:start position:0%
seems
like

04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
they're that there needs to be like okay
 
04:30:29.309 --> 04:30:29.319 align:start position:0%
there's uh the sighting of manufactured
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
housing you can do maybe one of these
 
04:30:33.870 --> 04:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
three things or whatever and then if you
 
04:30:36.189 --> 04:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
want to do manufactured housing Parks
 
04:30:37.510 --> 04:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
then you could do one of these three
 
04:30:39.790 --> 04:30:39.800 align:start position:0%
things or whatever
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
um those don't seem to be separated out
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
that that you have to do you know choose
 
04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
between these to meet meet this
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
requirement and these to meet that
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
requirement it seems all kind of jumbled
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
together in this amendment is is that
 
04:30:57.309 --> 04:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
kind of your reading of this or is there
 
04:31:00.910 --> 04:31:00.920 align:start position:0%
some way to delineate that you're um
 
04:31:00.920 --> 04:31:02.109 align:start position:0%
some way to delineate that you're um
doing

04:31:02.109 --> 04:31:02.119 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
housing um you're doing housing parks
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
and you're doing subdivisions
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
or are you seeing that the housing parks
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
and subdivisions are the same thing we
 
04:31:15.870 --> 04:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
want to see manufactured housing in all
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:25.920 --> 04:31:27.550 align:start position:0%
 
subdivisions

04:31:27.550 --> 04:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
04:31:31.870 --> 04:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay um representation
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman um I understand
 
04:31:38.910 --> 04:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
the intent I know that um Towns at this
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
point in time can't regulate out
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes so many towns still
 
04:31:50.229 --> 04:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
up north say on individual Lots or in
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Parks so all of that's good so if this
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
says now that that's an opportunity
 
04:31:58.750 --> 04:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
everywhere I'm totally behind that where
 
04:32:00.950 --> 04:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
where I come
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
into some clarification that I need
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:11.670 --> 04:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
32 uh I'll start with D municipalities
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
preventing manufactured housing uh shall
 
04:32:16.189 --> 04:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
afford reasonable realistic
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the development I'm
 
04:32:19.309 --> 04:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
paraphrasing in order to provide
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities lot size overall density
 
04:32:24.510 --> 04:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
requirements of manufactured home parks
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
shall be
 
04:32:28.670 --> 04:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable I'm afraid I'm afraid we
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
haven't added anything to the
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
conversation when you um when we go to
 
04:32:39.389 --> 04:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
a potential developer goes to a
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
town and um they have many times old
 
04:32:48.229 --> 04:32:48.239 align:start position:0%
zoning would have made lot size and
 
04:32:50.590 --> 04:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
density to a point that it was not
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
favorable for any new
 
04:32:52.720 --> 04:32:54.790 align:start position:0%
favorable for any new
expansion

04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm in favor but reasonable to these
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
towns is not reasonable to a developer
 
04:33:06.949 --> 04:33:06.959 align:start position:0%
my second issue is when I go to 313 2
 
04:33:08.750 --> 04:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturers opportunities for
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
expansion of manufactured housing
 
04:33:15.150 --> 04:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
parks in full disclosure this was my
 
04:33:18.670 --> 04:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
business for 30 plus years I developed
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
mobile home parks ran mobile home parks
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
uh manufactured home parks it's a proper
 
04:33:32.109 --> 04:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
subdivisions if there's a vacant I
 
04:33:35.949 --> 04:33:35.959 align:start position:0%
totally agree that that if there's a
 
04:33:40.109 --> 04:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
vacant lot in a uh in a park that they
 
04:33:42.029 --> 04:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
should be able to reoccupy it and
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to follow any new
 
04:33:46.910 --> 04:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
standard I don't see that written here
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't interpret 31 and 32 what
 
04:33:52.670 --> 04:33:52.680 align:start position:0%
what 31 and
 
04:33:57.189 --> 04:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
32 um says to me as a
 
04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
developer I have an existing Park I have
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
acreage that is alongside my Park
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
I would I would like to be able to
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
develop that Park as it was already
 
04:34:14.510 --> 04:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
developed and not turn that into 200
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
foot of Road Frontage in a quarter acre
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
lot when the rest of the park that's
 
04:34:23.189 --> 04:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
been there for 20 plus years is 40 feet
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
by 80 feet so am am I misunderstanding
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe you and I aren't the person
 
04:34:31.869 --> 04:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
that should have this conversation and I
 
04:34:34.150 --> 04:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor should be speaking with
 
04:34:37.590 --> 04:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
with the people sitting at our table do
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
you do you see 31 and 32 in my way or
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
your way I see them in both
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
ways um and and I think what we're who
 
04:34:49.230 --> 04:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
we're really waiting for is the star of
 
04:34:51.029 --> 04:34:51.039 align:start position:0%
the show here Ben Frost who's been the
 
04:34:53.230 --> 04:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
star of the day because I think he'll be
 
04:34:54.670 --> 04:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
able to answer most of these questions
 
04:34:54.680 --> 04:34:56.029 align:start position:0%
able to answer most of these questions
for

04:34:56.029 --> 04:34:56.039 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
us I would uh I will uh defer thank you
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you anyone
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
um call
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
on rob the pece from New Hampshire
 
04:35:24.070 --> 04:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:32.750 --> 04:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
twofer and uh don't worry I'm Rob dapas
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm just Ben's arm candy and I know
 
04:35:34.680 --> 04:35:35.750 align:start position:0%
but I'm just Ben's arm candy and I know
it

04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh I'm the executive director of New
 
04:35:39.949 --> 04:35:39.959 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing for those who don't
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
know us we're an independent
 
04:35:42.789 --> 04:35:42.799 align:start position:0%
self-supporting Corporation established
 
04:35:45.551 --> 04:35:45.561 align:start position:0%
by state law uh we're here to support
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
this bill with the proposed amendment uh
 
04:35:49.590 --> 04:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
I have letters in support of the
 
04:35:52.029 --> 04:35:52.039 align:start position:0%
amendment and a side-by-side comparison
 
04:35:54.629 --> 04:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
that been prepared uh between the
 
04:35:56.990 --> 04:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
existing statute and the bill as it
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
would uh as it was is would be amended
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
uh very quickly uh manufactured housing
 
04:36:04.269 --> 04:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
provides an important home ownership
 
04:36:06.150 --> 04:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
option for those who might not otherwise
 
04:36:07.869 --> 04:36:07.879 align:start position:0%
afford it it's an especially important
 
04:36:09.949 --> 04:36:09.959 align:start position:0%
part of the housing landscape in New
 
04:36:11.390 --> 04:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it can be affordable
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
without public subsidy which is very
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
difficult to achieve with other housing
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
typologies uh modern manufactured
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
housing as a previous speaker said can
 
04:36:23.189 --> 04:36:23.199 align:start position:0%
be attractive and efficient and as far
 
04:36:25.029 --> 04:36:25.039 align:start position:0%
from the uh stigmatized image that many
 
04:36:27.349 --> 04:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
people might have in their heads the
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
statute already requires uh reasonable
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh for the development of
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing uh we believe the
 
04:36:37.869 --> 04:36:37.879 align:start position:0%
bill is amended uh clarifies that
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and uh and makes some key uh
 
04:36:44.390 --> 04:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
but relatively modest improvements uh so
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
on this and uh I or more likely Ben
 
04:36:50.551 --> 04:36:50.561 align:start position:0%
would be happy to answer any
 
04:36:55.109 --> 04:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none oh we do is
 
04:37:01.510 --> 04:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
this my opportunity that I've been
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
looking for there you go Pres mcney the
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so if if I could draw your attention
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.959 --> 04:37:17.189 align:start position:0%
 
32

04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
32
 
04:37:21.789 --> 04:37:21.799 align:start position:0%
and I would agree that this this form of
 
04:37:25.990 --> 04:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
housing is is a is a great alternative
 
04:37:28.830 --> 04:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
to many and it's coste
 
04:37:31.390 --> 04:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
effective and it has evolved over the
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
years to be a much different product
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
than it was say in the 80s when I
 
04:37:38.949 --> 04:37:38.959 align:start position:0%
started in on this I surprised say I'm
 
04:37:41.310 --> 04:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
no longer in this business so it's not
 
04:37:43.750 --> 04:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
that big a conflict
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
here I I have real problems with with
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
realistic opportunities I'm wondering
 
04:37:56.590 --> 04:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
how you would feel when it comes down to
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
the requirements for manufactured
 
04:37:58.639 --> 04:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
the requirements for manufactured
housing

04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:38:00.000 --> 04:38:03.910 align:start position:0%
housing
Parks

04:38:03.910 --> 04:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
um if there was mention of density being
 
04:38:08.160 --> 04:38:09.310 align:start position:0%
um if there was mention of density being
in

04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh subsurface
 
04:38:13.709 --> 04:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
regulations or
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
something I'm I'm just saying that
 
04:38:15.920 --> 04:38:17.551 align:start position:0%
something I'm I'm just saying that
subsurface

04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
subsurface
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
regulations if if a town has a in my
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
opinion an unreasonable regulation I'm
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
not so worried about the residential
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
lots because residential lots you comply
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
the residential lot my concern is
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
there's no opportunity to expand or
 
04:38:36.910 --> 04:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
build more manufactured home parks and
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
there are there is a large segment of
 
04:38:42.990 --> 04:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
the population that can afford to have
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
rent and have their you and have their U
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
plowing Lawns and everything else taken
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
care of but that buy in is very
 
04:38:55.230 --> 04:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
expensive and I think there should
 
04:39:00.230 --> 04:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
be in statute that on expansion of a of
 
04:39:00.240 --> 04:39:01.070 align:start position:0%
be in statute that on expansion of a of
a

04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
property that reasonable should should
 
04:39:08.830 --> 04:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
correlate to uh uh
 
04:39:12.750 --> 04:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
regulations um and I'm spitballing
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
subsurface in the Water
 
04:39:19.029 --> 04:39:19.039 align:start position:0%
Division um so you know they might be
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
able to add on 10 more units five more
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
units with their existing well
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
structure and uh if the soils are
 
04:39:32.109 --> 04:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
favorable or if they were to buy a uh an
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
adjacent property and uh use that for
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
the purpose of septic Andor well that
 
04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
they could continue on with the lot size
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
originally developed for the
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and if I'm reaching too far
 
04:39:47.990 --> 04:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps we'll come back to this next
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
time but I do not like reasonable
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
because having sat on zoning boards for
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
20 plus
 
04:40:00.190 --> 04:40:00.200 align:start position:0%
years um and appearing before them all
 
04:40:02.628 --> 04:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
the time I could tell you which towns
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
are not reasonable to start with so I'm
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh thank you for the question
 
04:40:15.910 --> 04:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative makoni um I think you're
 
04:40:18.470 --> 04:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're right and listening to your
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
question earlier too um
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
about how much this does um the
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm referring to Amendment
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
114h uh is really intended to um parse
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
out the existing law in a way that it is
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
readable um I've been doing this stuff
 
04:40:46.030 --> 04:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and I have to
 
04:40:48.390 --> 04:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
confess uh I've been reading this
 
04:40:50.590 --> 04:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
statute wrong for
 
04:40:53.910 --> 04:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
decades uh it was only last summer when
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
I was compelled to really dig into it
 
04:40:56.878 --> 04:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
I was compelled to really dig into it
and

04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
to look at it word by word that I
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
realized I've gotten it wrong see I was
 
04:41:06.030 --> 04:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
looking at these three options as three
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
options and they're not it's really two
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
options a municipality either allows
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing on individual Lots
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
or in parks and
 
04:41:25.628 --> 04:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
subdivisions those are the two choices
 
04:41:27.510 --> 04:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
or I guess you you can allow all three
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
if you want I was looking at it as
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
individual Lots or Parks or subdivisions
 
04:41:37.590 --> 04:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
and I think if I've been getting it
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
wrong I can only imagine how many other
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
people are getting it wrong too so I
 
04:41:44.750 --> 04:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to ensure that there was some
 
04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
clarity here there's also ambiguity in
 
04:41:52.110 --> 04:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
the existing law and that is um with
 
04:41:55.430 --> 04:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
regard to where it says in most but not
 
04:41:58.030 --> 04:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily all land areas in District
 
04:42:00.390 --> 04:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
zone to permit residential uses the
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
second instance where it says that it's
 
04:42:07.150 --> 04:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
ambiguous as to whether it applies only
 
04:42:11.708 --> 04:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
to um placement on individual Lots or
 
04:42:14.310 --> 04:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
also to
 
04:42:17.230 --> 04:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
parks and so this the amendment seeks to
 
04:42:20.350 --> 04:42:20.360 align:start position:0%
clarify this and does clarify it meaning
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
it applies to all three
 
04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
situations that's one of the purposes of
 
04:42:29.190 --> 04:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
the amendment is to give Clarity to
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
local board members so they know how to
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
read this it's a tough statute to
 
04:42:34.320 --> 04:42:35.868 align:start position:0%
read this it's a tough statute to
understand

04:42:35.868 --> 04:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:42:39.470 --> 04:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
um and then as others have said uh the
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
the new language that is not currently
 
04:42:45.310 --> 04:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
in the statute that is uh in E the
 
04:42:48.510 --> 04:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendment starting on page one line 31
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
and going to the end uh that's new
 
04:42:54.788 --> 04:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
language it acknowledges um the the idea
 
04:42:56.628 --> 04:42:56.638 align:start position:0%
of expansion of existing parks and
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Maki to get to your
 
04:43:02.590 --> 04:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
question um the the notion of reasonable
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
and realistic is something that's in law
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh uh representative
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander correctly said it gives the
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
Judiciary the flexibility to interpret
 
04:43:19.070 --> 04:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh and they do uh it is language that
 
04:43:21.390 --> 04:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
also is in the workforce housing law
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
although the workforce housing law has a
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
little more flesh on the bones if you
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
will of what that
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
means um but if the committee wants to
 
04:43:35.230 --> 04:43:35.240 align:start position:0%
think about this more expansively
 
04:43:37.110 --> 04:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
we'd be very happy to work on an
 
04:43:39.510 --> 04:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
amendment that would set down specific
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
criteria I think your idea of using Dees
 
04:43:46.030 --> 04:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
subsurface Bureau standards for
 
04:43:49.070 --> 04:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
development is a really good
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
one okay any any
 
04:43:54.750 --> 04:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
Ella thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
question so um your kind of testimony
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if
 
04:44:06.830 --> 04:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh your your testimony would be that
 
04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're changing the rules as far as
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured uh kind of building on the
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
last speaker um
 
04:44:22.750 --> 04:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that online six we are um
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
requiring manufactured housing you
 
04:44:27.590 --> 04:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
previously said that the current law is
 
04:44:31.070 --> 04:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
or with between manufactured housing and
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
housing parks and
 
04:44:35.310 --> 04:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions um
 
04:44:37.990 --> 04:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
and we are changing that to ANS all the
 
04:44:40.750 --> 04:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
way across you have to do housing and
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
housing parks and subdivisions all three
 
04:44:46.150 --> 04:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
of them in your
 
04:44:46.160 --> 04:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
of them in your
municipality

04:44:48.150 --> 04:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:44:48.160 --> 04:44:49.910 align:start position:0%
municipality
um

04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
it's is that a uh your interpretation
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
and if it is so that we're going to
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
require all three in the
 
04:45:03.350 --> 04:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
municipality um why on line 9 and 10
 
04:45:06.150 --> 04:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
does it say in Soul discretion because
 
04:45:08.510 --> 04:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
they should just allow it in all three
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
they should just allow all three why why
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
in their so discretion what what does
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
that language mean to you I guess
 
04:45:18.190 --> 04:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative ell with with respect I
 
04:45:20.510 --> 04:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
think you've got it wrong okay um I I if
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
you look at the side by side that we
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
handed out that shows the existing
 
04:45:28.430 --> 04:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
statute and on the the right column and
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
the language from Amendment 114h on the
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
left column you'll see on the on the
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
first page um going down the right
 
04:45:39.708 --> 04:45:39.718 align:start position:0%
column where the where it says on
 
04:45:42.030 --> 04:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
individual lots and most that's at the
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
end it says
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
or if you go across to the left column
 
04:45:51.150 --> 04:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
it says or wait wait wait on at the end
 
04:45:53.030 --> 04:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
of what
 
04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph oh like three paragraphs down
 
04:45:59.670 --> 04:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay yeah yeah um so it the it says or
 
04:46:03.470 --> 04:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
there so on individual Lots or on
 
04:46:05.470 --> 04:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks in man
 
04:46:07.510 --> 04:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks
 
04:46:11.390 --> 04:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
and manufactured housing subdivisions so
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's the current law and the amendment
 
04:46:17.990 --> 04:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
both say on individual
 
04:46:22.470 --> 04:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
Lots or in parks and
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and and this the
 
04:46:27.190 --> 04:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
municipality's discretion is making the
 
04:46:30.070 --> 04:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
choice between those two on individual
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
Lots or in parks and
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:35.310 align:start position:0%
Lots or in parks and
subdivisions

04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
04:46:37.150 --> 04:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
can I follow
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
up thank you thank you um I was pointing
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
I was not pointing you to lines 15 and
 
04:46:48.590 --> 04:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
12 I was uh on the amendment I was
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
pointing you to line six on the amend on
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
on the amendment where it says citing of
 
04:46:57.270 --> 04:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
all three with ANS in between all of
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
them um and so
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
in in a like Roman Roman 1
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
a it's saying that you should do all
 
04:47:10.670 --> 04:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
three of
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
them is
 
04:47:15.750 --> 04:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
that is that not the interpretation of
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
that that line six I I I think you can
 
04:47:21.510 --> 04:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
interpret it that way but then it is
 
04:47:23.470 --> 04:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
followed by the very specific language
 
04:47:25.628 --> 04:47:25.638 align:start position:0%
that says that the municipality shall
 
04:47:28.270 --> 04:47:28.280 align:start position:0%
have the discretion to choose these
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
these options now okay just bear in
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
mind what what we're doing here is
 
04:47:36.270 --> 04:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
taking the existing language of the
 
04:47:40.390 --> 04:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
statute and and parsing it out if the
 
04:47:42.548 --> 04:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
committee wants to change that we'd be
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
happy to make that Amendment as
 
04:47:48.910 --> 04:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
well go thank you I would thank
 
04:47:48.920 --> 04:47:50.788 align:start position:0%
well go thank you I would thank
you

04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:47:55.230 --> 04:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
that representative de Leno thank you Mr
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
04:47:59.590 --> 04:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know I'm wondering if we're leaving
 
04:48:01.868 --> 04:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
some ideas on the table by not
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
considering commercial land
 
04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
and I say that
 
04:48:09.628 --> 04:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
because I believe that there could be
 
04:48:13.548 --> 04:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity in redevelop redeveloping
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
malls um I know that Newton mall right
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
now the lot the mall looks full look a
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
little closer all the cars there are
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
from car dealers so I I just I see the
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
death of malls and I think they could be
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
a wasteland but there could also be an
 
04:48:37.548 --> 04:48:37.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
that uh sure there are there certainly
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
are opportunities and we've seen one
 
04:48:42.510 --> 04:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
proposed here and conquered with
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
steelgate Mall uh there so so to some
 
04:48:47.548 --> 04:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
extent those sorts of things are
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
happening and there's been separate
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed that would address
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
the uh requirement to allow residential
 
04:48:57.628 --> 04:48:57.638 align:start position:0%
uses in areas where that are zoned
 
04:48:59.590 --> 04:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
commercial I guess that hasn't been part
 
04:49:01.150 --> 04:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
of the conversation here that could be
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
part of allowing reasonable and
 
04:49:04.470 --> 04:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
realistic opport ities for the
 
04:49:06.470 --> 04:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
development of manufactured housing
 
04:49:08.628 --> 04:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions in areas that are
 
04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
Zone commercial but it's not not part of
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
legislation okay anyone
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
else thank you represent Reed thank you
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
um so it's not I don't think it's
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
defined in this particular statute but I
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
was wondering about the definition and
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
I'm apologize because I was stepped out
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
um if someone already addressed this but
 
04:49:37.628 --> 04:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
the definition of manufactured housing
 
04:49:43.350 --> 04:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:46.830 --> 04:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
quanito term and would it be appropriate
 
04:49:48.990 --> 04:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
to use that larger umbrella term for all
 
04:49:53.868 --> 04:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
of those things and have it all apply
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
here thank you for the question the the
 
04:49:59.350 --> 04:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
um these are separate and distinct
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
things so manufactured housing is by by
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
statutory definition and it's
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
in I think the same statute uh 67431 or
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
32 uh it uh is defined as housing that
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
is built according to the federal code
 
04:50:22.310 --> 04:50:22.320 align:start position:0%
that is thank you
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
Katie all right so six you know I said
 
04:50:29.788 --> 04:50:29.798 align:start position:0%
67431 it is uh so that is housing that
 
04:50:31.708 --> 04:50:31.718 align:start position:0%
is buil built according according to the
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
HUD code that was originally adopted in
 
04:50:37.310 --> 04:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
19 74 uh so that is and it has specific
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
size standards uh I think 8T wide 32 ft
 
04:50:40.280 --> 04:50:41.788 align:start position:0%
size standards uh I think 8T wide 32 ft
long

04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
long
 
04:50:44.470 --> 04:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
um we used to call them trailers now we
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
call them manufactured housing because
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
once they're moved into place they
 
04:50:50.070 --> 04:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
typically don't ever move
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
again um modular is different because
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's not built like manufactured housing
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
on a chassis doesn't have a permanent
 
04:51:04.510 --> 04:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
chassis modular is just a block a
 
04:51:06.310 --> 04:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
building block if you will that is built
 
04:51:09.788 --> 04:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
according to the residential code not
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
the federal H HUD code for manufactured
 
04:51:15.590 --> 04:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
housing so modular housing or panelized
 
04:51:17.070 --> 04:51:17.080 align:start position:0%
housing which is you know walls
 
04:51:19.190 --> 04:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
pre-built and you assemble the walls
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
those are built according to the the
 
04:51:23.070 --> 04:51:23.080 align:start position:0%
residential code they these are things
 
04:51:23.080 --> 04:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
residential code they these are things
that

04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:26.750 --> 04:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
are um you know they both serve the
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of providing occupancy dwellings
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
for people to live in but they're built
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
Accord according to different codes and
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
should be treated different
 
04:51:38.830 --> 04:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
ly follow what thank you for that answer
 
04:51:40.948 --> 04:51:40.958 align:start position:0%
because I wasn't seeing the definition
 
04:51:43.470 --> 04:51:43.480 align:start position:0%
but I presumed it was in RSA just not in
 
04:51:47.590 --> 04:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
the RSA dealt with by the bill um are is
 
04:51:51.470 --> 04:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
there a similar statute to this existing
 
04:51:54.510 --> 04:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
one that says that towns should provide
 
04:51:56.868 --> 04:51:56.878 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunities for these other
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:01.868 --> 04:52:01.878 align:start position:0%
housing there there is another statute
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative uh that deals with
 
04:52:07.230 --> 04:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
uh what's called pre-site built housing
 
04:52:09.628 --> 04:52:09.638 align:start position:0%
and it is intended to
 
04:52:12.830 --> 04:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
distinguish uh it from manufactured
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
housing so it captures both panelized
 
04:52:17.788 --> 04:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
and modular housing uh that I think is
 
04:52:17.798 --> 04:52:18.990 align:start position:0%
and modular housing uh that I think is
RSA

04:52:18.990 --> 04:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
67431 a it's right around the same same
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
place in the statutes uh and uh I think
 
04:52:29.150 --> 04:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities are required to allow
 
04:52:30.708 --> 04:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
those because they're being built
 
04:52:33.110 --> 04:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
according to the building code so they
 
04:52:35.430 --> 04:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
the municip IP ality cannot treat a
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
modular or panelized home any
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
differently than a stick built home it's
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
built according to the building code
 
04:52:40.878 --> 04:52:41.948 align:start position:0%
built according to the building code
thank

04:52:41.948 --> 04:52:41.958 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:52:46.030 --> 04:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone else seeing none thank
 
04:52:46.040 --> 04:52:48.628 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone else seeing none thank
you

04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
gentlemen uh Ivy
 
04:53:02.548 --> 04:53:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.558 --> 04:53:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
bill

04:53:06.590 --> 04:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative barudi thank
 
04:53:10.350 --> 04:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
you members of the community of the
 
04:53:13.628 --> 04:53:13.638 align:start position:0%
committee I am here to speak in favor of
 
04:53:16.948 --> 04:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
the bill um in my professional life I'm
 
04:53:19.310 --> 04:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
a land use planner and I've been doing a
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
lot of work in small towns in New
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have received Housing
 
04:53:26.830 --> 04:53:26.840 align:start position:0%
Opportunity planning grants to see what
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
they can do to increase opportunities
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
for housing choice in those communities
 
04:53:34.390 --> 04:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I have come up
 
04:53:36.868 --> 04:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
against this past year while I've been
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
doing that work are uh Town ordinances
 
04:53:43.590 --> 04:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
that discriminate against manufactured
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
housing and you know there's a long
 
04:53:48.990 --> 04:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
whole long history of why they're there
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
but the fact is they are there and they
 
04:53:54.910 --> 04:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
should go away um getting a town
 
04:53:57.548 --> 04:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
individually to make those ordinances go
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
away is really hard it's a heavy lift I
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
am in favor of the statute although I
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
would go a little further I would
 
04:54:10.948 --> 04:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
require I would have the statute say
 
04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
towns shall allow manufactured housing
 
04:54:19.590 --> 04:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
in any place that a stick built or
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
pre-site built residence is allowed
 
04:54:25.708 --> 04:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
subject to the same um ordinance
 
04:54:31.030 --> 04:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
requirements or of not or but and also
 
04:54:34.030 --> 04:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
in parks and manufactured houses
 
04:54:36.390 --> 04:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and that there shall be
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation for the
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
increase in size of manufactured housing
 
04:54:45.670 --> 04:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions so that the towns
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the opportunity of saying
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
well we're complying because we said
 
04:54:52.350 --> 04:54:52.360 align:start position:0%
that they could put them in Parks but
 
04:54:54.750 --> 04:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
the statute the ordinance for the parks
 
04:54:58.070 --> 04:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
in these towns is often so difficult
 
04:55:01.590 --> 04:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
that they actually cannot be reasonably
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
increased in size so I recommend that
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
you take another stab at this relick
 
04:55:10.750 --> 04:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
your calf as my father would say relick
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
your calf on this one and said just say
 
04:55:18.470 --> 04:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
these are housing units and they shall
 
04:55:21.310 --> 04:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
be allowed all the places than any other
 
04:55:25.390 --> 04:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
housing unit can be allowed and also in
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
parks and
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and that's I'm happy to
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
take questions um but that's what I came
 
04:55:34.510 --> 04:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
here to say okay representative
 
04:55:39.430 --> 04:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
y thank you um I believe
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
you you misspoke when you were saying
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
that that that the sites the the housing
 
04:55:51.548 --> 04:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions should
 
04:55:55.708 --> 04:55:55.718 align:start position:0%
not regulate size I think you did you
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
mean to say reasonable accommodations
 
04:56:02.430 --> 04:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
for density instead of like size okay
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
let me explain what I me
 
04:56:05.948 --> 04:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
I meant if you are placing a
 
04:56:10.190 --> 04:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing unit on a on a lot
 
04:56:12.390 --> 04:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
not in a park not in a manufactured
 
04:56:15.310 --> 04:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
housing subdivision if you are placing
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
that unit on a lot that you bought on
 
04:56:20.830 --> 04:56:20.840 align:start position:0%
Elm Street that you have to comply with
 
04:56:22.510 --> 04:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the rules are for putting a
 
04:56:24.670 --> 04:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
single family house on a lot on Elm
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
Street with your terms of your setbacks
 
04:56:29.190 --> 04:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
your frontages your Frontage requirement
 
04:56:32.030 --> 04:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
whatever your parking requirements are
 
04:56:33.788 --> 04:56:33.798 align:start position:0%
that's the rule if you're just placing
 
04:56:36.788 --> 04:56:36.798 align:start position:0%
it on a lot if you're placing it in a
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing park or subdivision
 
04:56:41.990 --> 04:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
then the rule there should be there that
 
04:56:44.270 --> 04:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
the town should allow reasonable
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
increase in size of manufactured housing
 
04:56:49.310 --> 04:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
parks and subdivisions and the creation
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:56.070 --> 04:56:56.080 align:start position:0%
help the parks and sub parks and
 
04:56:58.350 --> 04:56:58.360 align:start position:0%
subdivisions get to make their own rules
 
04:57:01.470 --> 04:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
about how big the lots are but single
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
family houses don't
 
04:57:06.670 --> 04:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
right thanks you kept on saying the
 
04:57:08.868 --> 04:57:08.878 align:start position:0%
parks should be able to decide uh or the
 
04:57:13.510 --> 04:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
park should have uh a size and I was
 
04:57:14.788 --> 04:57:14.798 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
04:57:18.030 --> 04:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
clarifying information about what size
 
04:57:19.590 --> 04:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
you were talking about as far as the
 
04:57:21.990 --> 04:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
parks no that's sorry that I was
 
04:57:25.350 --> 04:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
confusing no what I what I mean is there
 
04:57:27.350 --> 04:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
should be parks and manufactured housing
 
04:57:29.070 --> 04:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
subdivisions they should be allowed to
 
04:57:30.910 --> 04:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
get bigger and you should be able to
 
04:57:34.030 --> 04:57:34.040 align:start position:0%
create a new one um and and you should
 
04:57:35.548 --> 04:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
also be able to put a manufactured
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
housing unit on any single family lot in
 
04:57:38.638 --> 04:57:39.628 align:start position:0%
housing unit on any single family lot in
the

04:57:39.628 --> 04:57:39.638 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
town okay I'll that anyone
 
04:57:46.868 --> 04:57:46.878 align:start position:0%
else representative mcon yep thank you
 
04:57:48.628 --> 04:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:57:51.670 --> 04:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
chairman okay we're on the same page I
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
figured we were the uh and I I believe I
 
04:57:59.470 --> 04:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
heard you add a little language on
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
3132 that I liked uh municipality shall
 
04:58:04.990 --> 04:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
allow reasonable realistic opportunities
 
04:58:07.708 --> 04:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
for expansion manufactured housing Parks
 
04:58:13.230 --> 04:58:13.240 align:start position:0%
existing did you then suggest or new I
 
04:58:15.270 --> 04:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
did what was what was your language on
 
04:58:17.670 --> 04:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
um what I think I said is municipalities
 
04:58:19.910 --> 04:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
shall be required to allow manufactured
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
housing units on any single family lot
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
or in uh manufactured housing Parks or
 
04:58:28.830 --> 04:58:28.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing subdivisions there
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
the town shall allow for the increase in
 
04:58:35.708 --> 04:58:35.718 align:start position:0%
of a manufactured housing park or
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision and the creation of new one
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
of of new manufactured housing Parks or
 
04:58:46.590 --> 04:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions because what I do see is
 
04:58:49.948 --> 04:58:49.958 align:start position:0%
I've seen more than once where the towns
 
04:58:52.708 --> 04:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
kind of skirt this by saying well we've
 
04:58:54.548 --> 04:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
got an existing manufactured housing
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
Park so we're good we don't have to do
 
04:59:01.548 --> 04:59:01.558 align:start position:0%
anything else and that is not helpful in
 
04:59:04.788 --> 04:59:04.798 align:start position:0%
terms of housing people I do also think
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
that a big part of this is going to be
 
04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
um explaining and
 
04:59:14.110 --> 04:59:14.120 align:start position:0%
educating um local municipalities about
 
04:59:16.030 --> 04:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
what manufactured housing is and what it
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
looks like and why it's important
 
04:59:21.948 --> 04:59:21.958 align:start position:0%
because I still have people telling me
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
that if you buy a manufactured housing
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
unit it depreciates like a car well no
 
04:59:29.590 --> 04:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it did before the adoption of
 
04:59:31.830 --> 04:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
the HUD rules in
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
1976 but it is no longer
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
true thank you okay anyone else
 
04:59:40.240 --> 04:59:41.708 align:start position:0%
true thank you okay anyone else
representative

04:59:41.708 --> 04:59:41.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:59:46.430 --> 04:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
question and it's good to see you back
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
um so I have a would you believe
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
followed up with a request sure would
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
you believe that when I spoke to my
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
previous not my current Town planner
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
about some overly restrictive
 
05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances when I was saying we need to
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
do something about the housing crisis
 
05:00:04.830 --> 05:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
and this was four years ago before the
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
housing crisis was as bad as it is now
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
my then Town planner said oh we already
 
05:00:13.030 --> 05:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
do enough for those people they have the
 
05:00:13.040 --> 05:00:14.110 align:start position:0%
do enough for those people they have the
trailer

05:00:14.110 --> 05:00:14.120 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
parks those that's an exact quote to
 
05:00:21.150 --> 05:00:21.160 align:start position:0%
which I said I am one of those people um
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
and the the request is because I
 
05:00:25.390 --> 05:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
completely agree as we already heard
 
05:00:28.750 --> 05:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire housing um that other
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
types of kind of unconventional housing
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
modular prefab are have to be treated
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
the same as stick built and it makes no
 
05:00:39.030 --> 05:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
sense to treat manufactured housing
 
05:00:41.310 --> 05:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
differently would you be willing to get
 
05:00:42.670 --> 05:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
this committee because I did take notes
 
05:00:44.590 --> 05:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
on everything you said but I would
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
prefer it if it came straight from you
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
get this committee your yeah suggested
 
05:00:50.948 --> 05:00:50.958 align:start position:0%
Amendment yes I certainly can do that
 
05:00:53.150 --> 05:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm speaking as a person
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
who spent this first eight years of her
 
05:00:57.270 --> 05:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
W life in a single wide friends and
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
neighbors not even a double wide um I
 
05:01:03.708 --> 05:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
think that it's high time we stopped
 
05:01:08.070 --> 05:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
uh assuming that manufactured housing is
 
05:01:09.470 --> 05:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
and the people who live in it are
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
somehow less than because they're not
 
05:01:12.160 --> 05:01:13.230 align:start position:0%
somehow less than because they're not
we're

05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:01:16.470 --> 05:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
not okay thank you okay anyone else
 
05:01:18.750 --> 05:01:18.760 align:start position:0%

Hampshire has a place to call home um I
 
05:01:55.030 --> 05:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
um have declined to testify on prior
 
05:01:57.590 --> 05:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
bills just because of time and knowing
 
05:01:59.628 --> 05:01:59.638 align:start position:0%
that we've had access to working with so
 
05:02:02.190 --> 05:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
many of you since you started uh your
 
05:02:04.830 --> 05:02:04.840 align:start position:0%
work um as a special committee I do just
 
05:02:06.150 --> 05:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
want to take this opportunity to
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
publicly thank you um I think we were
 
05:02:10.990 --> 05:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
all wondering what was going to come of
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
this effort and you have um shown um a
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
a a patience a knowledge a breadth and a
 
05:02:21.868 --> 05:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
depth in order to really understand this
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
issue and to propose real solutions and
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
I think before you what we had heard was
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
that there was maybe an opportunity to
 
05:02:33.230 --> 05:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
clean up the manufactured housing RSA so
 
05:02:34.548 --> 05:02:34.558 align:start position:0%
that it was more consistent with the
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
workforce housing law and you want to go
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
even further and so we would just like
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
to say that we would support you in that
 
05:02:43.070 --> 05:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a really important part
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
of diverse housing stock um and really
 
05:02:48.110 --> 05:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
important part of Workforce Housing
 
05:02:50.070 --> 05:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
Solutions and so we look forward to
 
05:02:51.750 --> 05:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
working with your committee on this and
 
05:02:53.948 --> 05:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of other proposals and that
 
05:02:55.150 --> 05:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
concludes my
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%

05:03:37.590 --> 05:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
or um that going further might
 
05:03:39.948 --> 05:03:39.958 align:start position:0%
jeopardize you know some cleanup that
 
05:03:42.150 --> 05:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
needs to happen as far as that or do you
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
think that you haven't heard significant
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%

will welcome the expansion I will say
 
05:03:55.868 --> 05:03:55.878 align:start position:0%
that our members are those who develop
 
05:03:57.708 --> 05:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
manage and finance affordable housing
 
05:04:00.270 --> 05:04:00.280 align:start position:0%

like we it's it's what we do um and to
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
the extent we're asking our state policy
 
05:04:10.830 --> 05:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
makers to really help us with that to to
 
05:04:13.868 --> 05:04:13.878 align:start position:0%
to um strengthen state law so that we're
 
05:04:16.750 --> 05:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
facing less confrontation at the local
 
05:04:18.910 --> 05:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
level and then we could um meet this
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
market demand and um and provide
 
05:04:23.990 --> 05:04:24.000 align:start position:0%

group and I'm here behalf excuse me this
 
05:05:11.310 --> 05:05:11.320 align:start position:0%
very on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association uh we
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
represent the manufacturers the
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
installers uh Park owners
 
05:05:21.910 --> 05:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
lenders insurers uh we do support this
 
05:05:24.708 --> 05:05:24.718 align:start position:0%
bill today um I'm not sure that it goes
 
05:05:27.390 --> 05:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
far enough uh I know there's been some
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
discussion about whether or not towns do
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate against manufactured
 
05:05:33.190 --> 05:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
housing and Parks um unfortunately that
 
05:05:35.150 --> 05:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
is our experience that they
 
05:05:40.750 --> 05:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
do we've experienced um a park down in
 
05:05:43.548 --> 05:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
Salem they purchased an adjacent lot to
 
05:05:46.110 --> 05:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
expand um and of course after that
 
05:05:48.830 --> 05:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
purchase they were denied the ability to
 
05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
expand um years back there was another
 
05:05:54.830 --> 05:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
municipality um a park wanted to expand
 
05:05:59.230 --> 05:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
near conquered and they were told that
 
05:06:01.030 --> 05:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
in order to do so they would have to
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
have a twoot minimum
 
05:06:05.948 --> 05:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:09.070 --> 05:06:09.080 align:start position:0%
Park excuse me to Aca thank you very
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
much apologize um so these things do
 
05:06:13.868 --> 05:06:13.878 align:start position:0%
exist exist and that is one way that
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:23.510 --> 05:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
this okay um representative Calla thank
 
05:06:23.520 --> 05:06:24.910 align:start position:0%
this okay um representative Calla thank
you

05:06:24.910 --> 05:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:06:27.708 --> 05:06:27.718 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your testimony and
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
taking this question um you kind of
 
05:06:34.788 --> 05:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
hinted at maybe some way that we could
 
05:06:37.548 --> 05:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
move this legislation a little bit more
 
05:06:40.350 --> 05:06:40.360 align:start position:0%
forward maybe not allowing them to
 
05:06:42.830 --> 05:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
require two acre lots for the for the
 
05:06:47.310 --> 05:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
thing but is there anything um else that
 
05:06:50.670 --> 05:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically you think uh municipalities
 
05:06:53.110 --> 05:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
or anyone is discrimination
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
discriminating against that we could use
 
05:07:00.270 --> 05:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
to uh in this bill to go further if the
 
05:07:02.070 --> 05:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
committee was willing to do that other
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
than you know saying you can't do two
 
05:07:07.708 --> 05:07:07.718 align:start position:0%
acre lot requirements for housing Parks
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
no that is an issue um of course and
 
05:07:12.548 --> 05:07:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's not just an issue for manufactured
 
05:07:15.390 --> 05:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
homes but I think we see in other towns
 
05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
that they have of course the minimum lot
 
05:07:20.390 --> 05:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
standards you know it's minimum size
 
05:07:23.190 --> 05:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
standards for their lots and so who's
 
05:07:25.548 --> 05:07:25.558 align:start position:0%
going to purchase a manufactured home
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
that is you know minimal in size and put
 
05:07:30.750 --> 05:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
it on 4 acres to 10 acres I mean that's
 
05:07:32.910 --> 05:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
another way that you're you're zoning
 
05:07:36.510 --> 05:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
town okay uh we'll start M
 
05:07:39.440 --> 05:07:41.070 align:start position:0%
town okay uh we'll start M
representative

05:07:41.070 --> 05:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:07:43.948 --> 05:07:43.958 align:start position:0%
Gibb thank you and thank you for taking
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
my question um and this is almost a
 
05:07:48.990 --> 05:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe but not
 
05:07:49.000 --> 05:07:51.230 align:start position:0%
would you believe but not
quite

05:07:51.230 --> 05:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
quite
 
05:07:55.708 --> 05:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
um how could anyone argue that a
 
05:07:58.270 --> 05:07:58.280 align:start position:0%
two-acre lot within a two-acre lot
 
05:08:00.750 --> 05:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
requirement within a manufactured
 
05:08:04.070 --> 05:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
housing Park could be
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable do you have any idea how they
 
05:08:11.830 --> 05:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't I've been
 
05:08:16.510 --> 05:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
inter thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question for your testimony um
 
05:08:21.548 --> 05:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
you may not be the right person to ask
 
05:08:25.510 --> 05:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
but um is it accurate to say as I
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
suspect that it is better for a town to
 
05:08:32.390 --> 05:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
have residents who own their home even
 
05:08:35.350 --> 05:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
if those homes are manufactured homes uh
 
05:08:37.150 --> 05:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
despite whatever stigma people may have
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
against manufactured homes it's better
 
05:08:41.470 --> 05:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
for the residents to own their home
 
05:08:43.670 --> 05:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
rather than be renters which is what
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
they would be forced into if they
 
05:08:48.910 --> 05:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
home I would agree um certainly it's
 
05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
still the most right now it's the most
 
05:08:57.868 --> 05:08:57.878 align:start position:0%
affordable form of housing in the state
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
of newshire whether you like it or not I
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:02.910 align:start position:0%
of newshire whether you like it or not I
mean

05:09:02.910 --> 05:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:09:02.920 --> 05:09:04.430 align:start position:0%
mean
representative

05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:09.070 --> 05:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
mcney thank you Mr chairman um in you
 
05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
bring up the same issue that I do about
 
05:09:15.150 --> 05:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh expansion and now having to go by the
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
latest standard which would be
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable uh would you think it might
 
05:09:21.230 --> 05:09:21.240 align:start position:0%
make sense to incorporate in this
 
05:09:23.788 --> 05:09:23.798 align:start position:0%
language we spoke with uh the other
 
05:09:26.190 --> 05:09:26.200 align:start position:0%
gentleman earlier that perhaps tying in
 
05:09:30.310 --> 05:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
uh density using subsurface and Water
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
Division yeah certainly something to
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
consider okay thank
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone oh
 
05:09:42.110 --> 05:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you thank you
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
for Tak my
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
question so we're in a room full of
 
05:09:46.958 --> 05:09:48.430 align:start position:0%
question so we're in a room full of
people

05:09:48.430 --> 05:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:09:53.150 --> 05:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:56.708 --> 05:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
support this bill and I apologize for
 
05:09:58.470 --> 05:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
speaking for everyone you didn't all say
 
05:10:01.470 --> 05:10:01.480 align:start position:0%
that but I think it's the consensus and
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
other measures to improve housing access
 
05:10:05.600 --> 05:10:07.590 align:start position:0%
other measures to improve housing access
and

05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:10:09.590 --> 05:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
quantity and we're going to bring
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
something forward to the legislature
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
which is a much more diverse population
 
05:10:16.430 --> 05:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
and different
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
perspectives I'm wondering what you or
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else might provide in terms
 
05:10:26.070 --> 05:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
of approaches and ways that we help
 
05:10:30.510 --> 05:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
people understand that this is not only
 
05:10:32.670 --> 05:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
needed because every everyone will give
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
lip service to saying we need to address
 
05:10:38.830 --> 05:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
housing but how do we make it appealing
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
to people who are reticent to do this
 
05:10:46.548 --> 05:10:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:50.548 --> 05:10:50.558 align:start position:0%
question um it's difficult I think you
 
05:10:52.708 --> 05:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
know unfortunately there is always that
 
05:10:56.070 --> 05:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
stigma you know that you know it's a a
 
05:10:58.590 --> 05:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
lower form of housing you know it's it's
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
again Ivy Ben spoke perfectly when she
 
05:11:02.910 --> 05:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
said said you know everything's been
 
05:11:04.990 --> 05:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
ramped up with HUD Energy Efficiency
 
05:11:07.390 --> 05:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
everything like that um so people tend
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
to look back and think oh these are your
 
05:11:12.868 --> 05:11:12.878 align:start position:0%
70s homes that fall apart right um and
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
that of course if you have a park you're
 
05:11:16.030 --> 05:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
going to bring in you know five children
 
05:11:18.548 --> 05:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
for a manufactured home it's going to
 
05:11:21.868 --> 05:11:21.878 align:start position:0%
you know drain our education system um
 
05:11:24.230 --> 05:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
so unfortunately that's all education
 
05:11:25.390 --> 05:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
that you're going to have to do at the
 
05:11:28.030 --> 05:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
local level and I would probably start
 
05:11:29.390 --> 05:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:11:35.070 --> 05:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:38.350 --> 05:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
better how
 
05:11:40.750 --> 05:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
perfect come on up
 
05:11:42.948 --> 05:11:42.958 align:start position:0%
n but I mean I would think that they
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
would certainly be in the best position
 
05:11:46.830 --> 05:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:56.350 --> 05:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.868 --> 05:12:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.878 --> 05:12:02.590 align:start position:0%
 
who

05:12:02.590 --> 05:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
who
 
05:12:02.600 --> 05:12:05.190 align:start position:0%
who
card

05:12:05.190 --> 05:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
card
 
05:12:05.200 --> 05:12:07.430 align:start position:0%
card
okay

05:12:07.430 --> 05:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:07.440 --> 05:12:10.030 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

05:12:10.030 --> 05:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:12:10.040 --> 05:12:12.708 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:12:12.708 --> 05:12:12.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:12.718 --> 05:12:15.150 align:start position:0%
um
M

05:12:15.150 --> 05:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
M
 
05:12:15.160 --> 05:12:17.070 align:start position:0%
M
friend

05:12:17.070 --> 05:12:17.080 align:start position:0%
friend
 
05:12:21.948 --> 05:12:21.958 align:start position:0%
okay okay you get sorry about
 
05:12:25.510 --> 05:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
that hi I'm M friedricks um and I'm
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
representing myself um
 
05:12:32.190 --> 05:12:32.200 align:start position:0%
I uh support this bill but I wonder if
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
the committee might consider an
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
amendment um because um my understanding
 
05:12:40.430 --> 05:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
is that manufactured housing can be a
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
really positive opportunity for families
 
05:12:45.590 --> 05:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um if they own their own home it
 
05:12:47.190 --> 05:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
provides all those benefits of home
 
05:12:49.788 --> 05:12:49.798 align:start position:0%
ownership such as stability as well as
 
05:12:52.390 --> 05:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
um the ability to to grow that as an
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
asset um but if it is located on a um
 
05:13:00.310 --> 05:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
park that is not cooperatively owned um
 
05:13:02.510 --> 05:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
and that has a
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh a landlord who is um not particularly
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
responsible or is uh is really looking
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
to just make a return on investment then
 
05:13:15.548 --> 05:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
we've seen in some other states across
 
05:13:18.150 --> 05:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
the country that the rental prices for
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
that land um can really become another
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
housing crisis issue um and so I would
 
05:13:25.750 --> 05:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to look to other
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
states um and consider perhaps an
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that would um provide greater
 
05:13:34.350 --> 05:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
benefit to manufactured housing
 
05:13:35.670 --> 05:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
communities that are owned as
 
05:13:38.590 --> 05:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
cooperatives where residents truly are
 
05:13:41.270 --> 05:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
have a home ownership model um and and
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
really benefit in our knot um because
 
05:13:47.110 --> 05:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
the the difficulty of of owning a home
 
05:13:50.510 --> 05:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
um that then is fixed on a you know on a
 
05:13:51.990 --> 05:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
piece of land if you don't own the land
 
05:13:53.708 --> 05:13:53.718 align:start position:0%
is that you really can't have a choice
 
05:13:56.310 --> 05:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
of moving mean you own the home but now
 
05:13:58.548 --> 05:13:58.558 align:start position:0%
whatever the landlord is charging for
 
05:14:01.270 --> 05:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
that land the rent on that land you're
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
paying um and that's why Roc um my
 
05:14:06.788 --> 05:14:06.798 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's why um rock New
 
05:14:08.910 --> 05:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire got started and why rock you
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
know um is taking that to a national
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
level so so please consider um you know
 
05:14:17.430 --> 05:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
favoring uh a home ownership model um in
 
05:14:19.750 --> 05:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
this legislation and and I'd encourage
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to look more into that
 
05:14:24.310 --> 05:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
issue um and consider how to work with
 
05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
rock on some of that wording or um what
 
05:14:29.310 --> 05:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
could be done to really encourage that
 
05:14:32.910 --> 05:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh cooperatively owned um Park
 
05:14:35.470 --> 05:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
model thank you very much for your
 
05:14:39.150 --> 05:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
time okay any
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
questions okay seeing
 
05:14:43.548 --> 05:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
none uh
 
05:14:43.558 --> 05:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
none uh
Roy

05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
wner did you press the button thank you
 
05:14:56.750 --> 05:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Roy schwe from conquered I
 
05:15:00.910 --> 05:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to respond to a couple
 
05:15:04.750 --> 05:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
things people have said as far as uh the
 
05:15:07.310 --> 05:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
idea of owning a mobile home or a
 
05:15:10.030 --> 05:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
modular home and not the land under it I
 
05:15:12.868 --> 05:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
see that as a real problem because I
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
remember when the rent for a lot was $50
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
a month now it's 500 a month and more
 
05:15:19.390 --> 05:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
there seems to be no limit as to what
 
05:15:21.070 --> 05:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
they can charge you and has been said
 
05:15:23.230 --> 05:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
you really have no method of moving it
 
05:15:26.110 --> 05:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
anywhere else and so I think that we
 
05:15:28.470 --> 05:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
need to you know if we're going to
 
05:15:30.628 --> 05:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
encourage the development of uh mobile
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
homes and modu homes we need to find
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
some way of I hate to say rent control
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
because I know that's not going to fly
 
05:15:41.390 --> 05:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
in the state but some way of keeping you
 
05:15:43.510 --> 05:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
know lot affordable I know a person that
 
05:15:43.520 --> 05:15:44.510 align:start position:0%
know lot affordable I know a person that
owned

05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
owned
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
a mobile home the rent in the lot kept
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
going up and up and they finally
 
05:15:51.430 --> 05:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
committed suicide they just couldn't
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
handle all the expenses so you know I
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea and I'll give you
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
an example if any of you people are
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
familiar with where Walmart and Market
 
05:16:04.510 --> 05:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
Basket are at exit 20 in Tilton that
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
used to be a mobile home park but guess
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
what Walmart and Market Bas and whoever
 
05:16:11.868 --> 05:16:11.878 align:start position:0%
decides the land is more valuable to
 
05:16:13.708 --> 05:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
them I still don't know where all those
 
05:16:13.718 --> 05:16:14.548 align:start position:0%
them I still don't know where all those
people

05:16:14.548 --> 05:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:16:16.830 --> 05:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
went and the second thing I wanted to
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
say is regards of places that are trying
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
to zone out
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh modular homes one of them is
 
05:16:27.030 --> 05:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
conquered they are proposing a new
 
05:16:28.948 --> 05:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance it's trying to
 
05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
eliminate the you know stuff on a chaty
 
05:16:35.230 --> 05:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
like trailers and only allow the uh more
 
05:16:36.910 --> 05:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
expensive ones you know that are set on
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
a foundation so I think that you know
 
05:16:42.110 --> 05:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's a real issue if you want to
 
05:16:45.070 --> 05:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
be expansive you need to say no you
 
05:16:47.910 --> 05:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
cannot you know eliminate the chassis
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
built ones just because they may look
 
05:16:53.350 --> 05:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
tacky because they may be less expensive
 
05:16:54.910 --> 05:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
and the last thing is I think you really
 
05:16:56.948 --> 05:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
need to consider what communities have
 
05:17:00.390 --> 05:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
done already I think it's more important
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
to apply some pressure to communities
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
that don't have any modular home parks
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
than some that already have so many you
 
05:17:10.110 --> 05:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
know we don't need to have communities
 
05:17:12.590 --> 05:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
that are 100% modular homes we need to
 
05:17:14.910 --> 05:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
allow them to upgrade their housing and
 
05:17:16.590 --> 05:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
at the same time allow some of the
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
communities that have none to add them
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
so maybe if you could fit something in
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
if you do not have any yet it's easier
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
to build one than if you already have
 
05:17:27.788 --> 05:17:27.798 align:start position:0%
half the town in them thank you okay
 
05:17:29.310 --> 05:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
05:17:32.000 --> 05:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
much

05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.190 --> 05:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure the first name but
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.110 --> 05:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
Neil oh okay thank thank you Mr chair
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
all right I'm sorry about that no
 
05:17:54.590 --> 05:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
worries uh my handwriting is terrible n
 
05:17:56.548 --> 05:17:56.558 align:start position:0%
GES with the municipal
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
Association um since we were we were
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
called upon I will comment um the
 
05:18:04.030 --> 05:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that representative Alexander
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:10.230 --> 05:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
0114 um in looking at the comparison
 
05:18:13.150 --> 05:18:13.160 align:start position:0%
between that and and the existing law um
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
It Is by and large um just a
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
reformulation of the existing law um
 
05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
except for Section e which which now
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
provides for reasonable realistic
 
05:18:24.110 --> 05:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity for expansion of
 
05:18:26.270 --> 05:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Parks as I believe
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee has already heard that
 
05:18:30.670 --> 05:18:30.680 align:start position:0%
just reflects um what the legislature
 
05:18:32.948 --> 05:18:32.958 align:start position:0%
has done with Workforce
 
05:18:38.670 --> 05:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
housing um as far as any position on
 
05:18:41.510 --> 05:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
um that proposed amendment we don't have
 
05:18:44.030 --> 05:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
one um I've heard several other proposed
 
05:18:46.270 --> 05:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
amendments today uh we would likely
 
05:18:47.948 --> 05:18:47.958 align:start position:0%
object to any of those should the
 
05:18:51.150 --> 05:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
committee consider them um and I guess
 
05:18:52.310 --> 05:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
there are a couple things I want to
 
05:18:53.590 --> 05:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
point out I think the committee's heard
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
some pretty mixed uh information about
 
05:18:59.150 --> 05:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh manufactured home communities and
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
whether they're of the effects they have
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
on residence I'm I'm not the expert on
 
05:19:06.350 --> 05:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
it but I understand that Professor
 
05:19:06.360 --> 05:19:07.310 align:start position:0%
it but I understand that Professor
Esther

05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
Esther
 
05:19:10.750 --> 05:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
Sullivan of um I don't remember what
 
05:19:12.830 --> 05:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
university um but she wrote a book
 
05:19:14.708 --> 05:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
called manufactured in security mobile
 
05:19:16.548 --> 05:19:16.558 align:start position:0%
home parks in America's tenuous rights
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
to place which
 
05:19:20.948 --> 05:19:20.958 align:start position:0%
discusses um effectively how
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks work obviously
 
05:19:25.470 --> 05:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
there are a couple of different models
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
um one of them is the residents own the
 
05:19:30.750 --> 05:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
park um they're in control of their own
 
05:19:33.590 --> 05:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
lot rent rents and the other option is
 
05:19:36.350 --> 05:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
that some Corporation typically owns the
 
05:19:39.910 --> 05:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
lot um and charges lot rents um
 
05:19:41.430 --> 05:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
obviously when we're talking about
 
05:19:44.548 --> 05:19:44.558 align:start position:0%
people living in manufactured homes
 
05:19:46.590 --> 05:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
we're often talking about lower income
 
05:19:48.830 --> 05:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
individuals they often don't have the
 
05:19:51.788 --> 05:19:51.798 align:start position:0%
financial capacity to pay to move their
 
05:19:53.470 --> 05:19:53.480 align:start position:0%
their home so even if they are
 
05:19:55.990 --> 05:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
technically movable they can't afford
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
that um so as a result if they own those
 
05:20:03.150 --> 05:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
homes they're subject to whatever the
 
05:20:05.910 --> 05:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
lot rent is if they don't own that
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
property the problem is is that that
 
05:20:13.150 --> 05:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
creates a monopoly situation where they
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
have to continue to pay for that lot
 
05:20:17.708 --> 05:20:17.718 align:start position:0%
rent because otherwise they're out of a
 
05:20:21.390 --> 05:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
home and they may not be able to um and
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
we've seen that and I've certainly
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony today about how
 
05:20:24.400 --> 05:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony today about how
that

05:20:25.190 --> 05:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:28.750 --> 05:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
occurs and so you end up with renters In
 
05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
This Very tenuous situation who who are
 
05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
paying substantial portions of their
 
05:20:37.390 --> 05:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
income to um corporations to hedge funds
 
05:20:39.910 --> 05:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
in particular um who've capitalize this
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
over the past couple
 
05:20:43.590 --> 05:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
decades so I think the committee should
 
05:20:45.430 --> 05:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
be aware of that that's a serious
 
05:20:49.708 --> 05:20:49.718 align:start position:0%
concern um certainly um it's a policy
 
05:20:51.628 --> 05:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
consideration as you going forward and
 
05:20:54.110 --> 05:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
it affects municipalities because we're
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
the ones responsible for things like
 
05:20:57.230 --> 05:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
local welfare so we're the ones who have
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
to provide Aid if they are not able to
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
afford that um um so that does concern
 
05:21:05.590 --> 05:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
us um the other thing I want to mention
 
05:21:07.110 --> 05:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
is that communities have started to use
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
tools like land value capture that's
 
05:21:13.150 --> 05:21:13.160 align:start position:0%
something that um is promoted by places
 
05:21:15.470 --> 05:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
like the Lincoln Institute for um the
 
05:21:16.910 --> 05:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
Lincoln Institute which which covers
 
05:21:20.350 --> 05:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
land policy um and a lot of that focuses
 
05:21:22.868 --> 05:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
on promoting zoning options that focus
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
on increasing density on mixed use um
 
05:21:28.070 --> 05:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
especially in core urban areas but
 
05:21:31.430 --> 05:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
expanding out from that which allows you
 
05:21:34.830 --> 05:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
to leverage that density to lower costs
 
05:21:38.030 --> 05:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
overall for things for provisions of
 
05:21:40.110 --> 05:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
things like public water and sewer and
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
Roads because you have more people in a
 
05:21:46.350 --> 05:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
smaller space paying for that um and you
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
know if the real were here today and I'm
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
not sure if they've already testified on
 
05:21:50.510 --> 05:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
this but they would tell you that they
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
did some surveys that Americas prefer
 
05:21:55.070 --> 05:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
Americans prefer walkable communities
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
that appears that is something that I
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
think planners Statewide and Nationwide
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
are aiming to help communities move
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
toward but we're not there yet when
 
05:22:07.510 --> 05:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a community like a
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
manufactured home Community that's a
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
single use Community um when we're
 
05:22:13.750 --> 05:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
talking about best use of land that's
 
05:22:15.708 --> 05:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the best use of land in
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
all areas of the municipality it may be
 
05:22:22.110 --> 05:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
a good use of land some places but not
 
05:22:25.270 --> 05:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily everywhere um so that's just
 
05:22:26.670 --> 05:22:26.680 align:start position:0%
some information I want to provide the
 
05:22:29.310 --> 05:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
committee I'm happy to answer any
 
05:22:31.948 --> 05:22:31.958 align:start position:0%
questions okay any question
 
05:22:36.270 --> 05:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
questions no oh representative re thank
 
05:22:38.430 --> 05:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
question um so I'm I'm thank you for
 
05:22:45.470 --> 05:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
raising the issue of and I apologies if
 
05:22:48.070 --> 05:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
I'm over reaching in my description but
 
05:22:50.990 --> 05:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
essentially predatory lot rents by
 
05:22:54.190 --> 05:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
owners of parks
 
05:22:58.110 --> 05:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
um if and again I understand that you do
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
you can't really speak outside of what
 
05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
you've been authorized to to present but
 
05:23:06.750 --> 05:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
to the best as you're able would it be
 
05:23:09.590 --> 05:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um would it would it address the issue
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
if if there's an amendment that's saying
 
05:23:16.030 --> 05:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
you have to allow um manufactured homes
 
05:23:19.230 --> 05:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
in single lots and parks and
 
05:23:23.470 --> 05:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to to um amend that to say
 
05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
cooperatives for parks and subdivisions
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing for the single
 
05:23:30.030 --> 05:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
ownership because if you're forcing
 
05:23:32.910 --> 05:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
towns to allow them across the board
 
05:23:34.590 --> 05:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
then because as I understand the law
 
05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
right now is giving towns the option
 
05:23:38.708 --> 05:23:38.718 align:start position:0%
either to allow it here or to allow it
 
05:23:41.510 --> 05:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
in in lots and if you're forcing them
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
across the board then we're still saying
 
05:23:47.470 --> 05:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
well the the town has to allow these
 
05:23:51.030 --> 05:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
potentially predatory owners of of parks
 
05:23:53.510 --> 05:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
and so by refining it to they have to
 
05:23:55.548 --> 05:23:55.558 align:start position:0%
allow cooperatives but not necessarily
 
05:23:57.830 --> 05:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
the other would that address the issue
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
that you
 
05:24:02.628 --> 05:24:02.638 align:start position:0%
raised I'm not sure how to answer that
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
question um I'm not the person to
 
05:24:08.390 --> 05:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
Advocate on kind of that area
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
specifically um what I will say is you
 
05:24:14.270 --> 05:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
know under current law um municipalities
 
05:24:16.110 --> 05:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
have to provide reasonable opportunities
 
05:24:20.948 --> 05:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
to site um manufactured homes so um that
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
would be a change
 
05:24:23.360 --> 05:24:25.030 align:start position:0%
would be a change
um

05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:28.390 --> 05:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative M
 
05:24:35.390 --> 05:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:38.510 --> 05:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
um currently uh currently in law if
 
05:24:41.070 --> 05:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
there's a manufactured home park and
 
05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
that Park comes up for sale and it has
 
05:24:46.510 --> 05:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
residency in it then the residents are
 
05:24:48.830 --> 05:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
offered the opportunity to purchase the
 
05:24:50.430 --> 05:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
property at the price that was being
 
05:24:53.990 --> 05:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
sold at so there there's a mechanism
 
05:24:57.948 --> 05:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
there um I I need to say
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
that people that own parks are not all
 
05:25:05.110 --> 05:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
predators people wanting to develop
 
05:25:08.788 --> 05:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
parks are not Predators the
 
05:25:11.708 --> 05:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
developers could see a business model
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
that makes
 
05:25:16.070 --> 05:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
sense and providing an
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh for more housing units
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
some places it's seasonal
 
05:25:25.548 --> 05:25:25.558 align:start position:0%
housing uh some of those places are
 
05:25:28.230 --> 05:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
homeownership um I would not be in favor
 
05:25:31.548 --> 05:25:31.558 align:start position:0%
of language that just said Co-op but
 
05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
would you at least agree that not all
 
05:25:37.310 --> 05:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
developers are predatory and that own
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
mobile home
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
parks just to clarify I didn't mean to
 
05:25:43.628 --> 05:25:43.638 align:start position:0%
imply that if that's what the committee
 
05:25:47.510 --> 05:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard I I did not hear you say that sir
 
05:25:50.510 --> 05:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
I I certainly couldn't impute intentions
 
05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
for anyone um I was just reporting that
 
05:25:56.230 --> 05:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
information that has come to me uh what
 
05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
you do with that is up to you follow up
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
I I use you as a sound board and I
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
apologize for that they um would there
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
was discussion earlier about expanding
 
05:26:08.160 --> 05:26:09.510 align:start position:0%
was discussion earlier about expanding
allowing

05:26:09.510 --> 05:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
05:26:12.230 --> 05:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
expansion and in the words
 
05:26:15.030 --> 05:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable uh are you opposed with
 
05:26:16.670 --> 05:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
municipality you'd have to see an
 
05:26:19.470 --> 05:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
amendment but are you are you opposed to
 
05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
at least saying uh to certain standards
 
05:26:26.548 --> 05:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
being subsurface Andor water at least
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
Del laying U some groundwork I'd be
 
05:26:31.310 --> 05:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
happy to work on any any sort of
 
05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think you know as long as
 
05:26:35.868 --> 05:26:35.878 align:start position:0%
we're taking into consideration of the
 
05:26:38.830 --> 05:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
needs for subsurface water Etc I think
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
that is probably a reasonable compromise
 
05:26:44.190 --> 05:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
we can come to thank you
 
05:26:48.430 --> 05:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
sir anyone else represent your col thank
 
05:26:52.070 --> 05:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
you there was there was some um some
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
discussion about the um
 
05:26:57.360 --> 05:26:59.070 align:start position:0%
discussion about the um
allowing

05:26:59.070 --> 05:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
05:27:02.070 --> 05:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing everywhere that
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
other housing is allowed do you believe
 
05:27:07.470 --> 05:27:07.480 align:start position:0%
that municipality should have the right
 
05:27:12.190 --> 05:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
to discriminate as ver the method of the
 
05:27:15.070 --> 05:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
housing or or or do you think that you
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
know if it meets all the other
 
05:27:19.270 --> 05:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of the housing that that
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
that it should you know whether it's
 
05:27:24.830 --> 05:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
single bit uh uh stick built or
 
05:27:26.990 --> 05:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
manufactured that as long as they meet
 
05:27:29.548 --> 05:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
those same requirements it it should be
 
05:27:31.548 --> 05:27:31.558 align:start position:0%
it's able the that you would not oppose
 
05:27:35.948 --> 05:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
them uh the state uh saying that these
 
05:27:37.910 --> 05:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
should be equal treated equally by the
 
05:27:39.750 --> 05:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
municipality or you think that they
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
should be able to
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
discriminate my understanding is
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
existing law requires them to provide
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunities for
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and most
 
05:27:49.470 --> 05:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have interpreted this in
 
05:27:50.750 --> 05:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
a way to
 
05:27:53.350 --> 05:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
allow either option as long as it fits
 
05:27:56.470 --> 05:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
within existing zoning I don't have a
 
05:28:00.470 --> 05:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'm personally don't have a full know
 
05:28:02.948 --> 05:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
know of this area so there may be
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
experts from the state who you could ask
 
05:28:07.390 --> 05:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
um who would provide more information
 
05:28:10.830 --> 05:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
but I that's my understanding of how
 
05:28:12.150 --> 05:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
that has been interpreted based on what
 
05:28:13.750 --> 05:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
my members have told me okay thank you
 
05:28:13.760 --> 05:28:15.270 align:start position:0%
my members have told me okay thank you
very

05:28:15.270 --> 05:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:28:17.868 --> 05:28:17.878 align:start position:0%
much he having no more cards we're going
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:31.070 align:start position:0%
 
1361

05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
1361
 
05:28:33.150 --> 05:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
1399 I don't
 
05:28:41.110 --> 05:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:41.120 --> 05:28:59.310 align:start position:0%
 
think

05:28:59.310 --> 05:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.320 --> 05:29:24.788 align:start position:0%

05:30:20.470 --> 05:30:20.480 align:start position:0%

you today um I am in my day job an
 
05:30:30.548 --> 05:30:30.558 align:start position:0%
architect attorney I've been involved in
 
05:30:32.470 --> 05:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh development projects in New Hampshire
 
05:30:35.548 --> 05:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
for about 10 years and I'm very
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
passionate about expanding access to
 
05:30:39.990 --> 05:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
housing for everyone in New Hampshire I
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
think uh what this committee is charged
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
with is a noble goal and I hope that we
 
05:30:46.030 --> 05:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
are able to work together to come up
 
05:30:48.430 --> 05:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
with some solutions preferably Creative
 
05:30:50.190 --> 05:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
Solutions the architect and me loves
 
05:30:52.948 --> 05:30:52.958 align:start position:0%
Creative Solutions um so uh we're
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
passing out an amendment right now this
 
05:30:57.030 --> 05:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
is the Reed McWilliams amendment to
 
05:30:58.110 --> 05:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:31:00.470 --> 05:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
1399 uh this takes in a little bit of
 
05:31:03.548 --> 05:31:03.558 align:start position:0%
conversation and change to the base bill
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have amendment to HB
 
05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
1399 um let's make sure that you get a
 
05:31:12.628 --> 05:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
copy and they're going
 
05:31:15.510 --> 05:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
around they're over there
 
05:31:18.030 --> 05:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
okay we'll pass them
 
05:31:20.470 --> 05:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
out for like the public if they want to
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
see there's a bunch yeah okay yeah
 
05:31:25.030 --> 05:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
them thank you so much let's make sure
 
05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's looking at the same things so
 
05:31:30.868 --> 05:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
there's no question questions
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
referencing back to the uh as introduced
 
05:31:34.750 --> 05:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we're talking
 
05:31:37.590 --> 05:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
about Amendment U and the actual number
 
05:31:38.910 --> 05:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have you hold on for a
 
05:31:40.628 --> 05:31:40.638 align:start position:0%
second do you not have a copy of the
 
05:31:42.868 --> 05:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
amendment okay can we get representative
 
05:31:51.310 --> 05:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:54.430 --> 05:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
please EXC all right we are organized we
 
05:31:56.990 --> 05:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
are ready to go thank you um all right
 
05:31:59.070 --> 05:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is 202
 
05:32:01.628 --> 05:32:01.638 align:start position:0%
24444 H just so everyone's looking at
 
05:32:04.750 --> 05:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
the same piece of paper
 
05:32:08.270 --> 05:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh the intent here and just to
 
05:32:10.830 --> 05:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of History um is to
 
05:32:13.190 --> 05:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
come up with a way to allow more than
 
05:32:16.230 --> 05:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
one unit on areas that have been zoned
 
05:32:18.670 --> 05:32:18.680 align:start position:0%
as single family provided they meet
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
specific criteria uh if you if you were
 
05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
engaged last year we had a pretty big
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
debate about the fourplex is a house
 
05:32:30.190 --> 05:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill which was allowing up to four units
 
05:32:32.510 --> 05:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
on single family zoning and I I would
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
say that my takea away from that bill
 
05:32:36.708 --> 05:32:36.718 align:start position:0%
was that the appetite for four units may
 
05:32:39.230 --> 05:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
be a little bit too much so if we dial
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
it back to two units let's see if we can
 
05:32:43.270 --> 05:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
be realistic with the checklist criteria
 
05:32:45.390 --> 05:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
for allowing two units um in what is
 
05:32:46.990 --> 05:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise considered single family
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
residential zoning um so that is the
 
05:32:53.548 --> 05:32:53.558 align:start position:0%
intent here is to be allowed to increase
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh if you already own a house or if you
 
05:32:59.470 --> 05:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
are purchasing a house and it's on a lot
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
under 2 Acres right um and this needs to
 
05:33:06.990 --> 05:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
be allowed within your town or city for
 
05:33:08.030 --> 05:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
at least
 
05:33:11.510 --> 05:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
50% of all all Lots in a municipality
 
05:33:13.910 --> 05:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
zone for single family residential so if
 
05:33:16.510 --> 05:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
you live in a small town with mostly
 
05:33:18.590 --> 05:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
single family residential then at least
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
50% of that would need to allow this um
 
05:33:24.990 --> 05:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
you would be allowed as a owner of this
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh house or purchaser of the house or
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
someone who owns a lot and wants to do
 
05:33:31.230 --> 05:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
this Construction proess project you can
 
05:33:33.310 --> 05:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
expand a single family residence to no
 
05:33:35.750 --> 05:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
more than two residential
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
units um if you meet the following
 
05:33:40.510 --> 05:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
checklist of criteria and these are all
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
sort of negotiated points taking in
 
05:33:44.788 --> 05:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
input from all kinds of
 
05:33:46.990 --> 05:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
participants uh the first is that the
 
05:33:48.750 --> 05:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
proposed housing would not require
 
05:33:51.510 --> 05:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
demolition or alteration of housing
 
05:33:54.110 --> 05:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
subject to covenants ordinances or law
 
05:33:55.750 --> 05:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
that restricts rents to affordable
 
05:33:57.548 --> 05:33:57.558 align:start position:0%
housing or persons of families of mar
 
05:33:59.310 --> 05:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
low or very low income so if you're
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
already in a community and that this
 
05:34:03.310 --> 05:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
house is subject to those types of
 
05:34:05.830 --> 05:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
restrictions then you would already be
 
05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
out your proposal to go to two units
 
05:34:11.590 --> 05:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
won't work um second piece of that is if
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
this is already housing that you've
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
either purchased or you currently own
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
and it's been occupied by a tenant in
 
05:34:18.430 --> 05:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
the last three years uh that's housing
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
that we really don't want to start
 
05:34:22.030 --> 05:34:22.040 align:start position:0%
disrupting or changing and so therefore
 
05:34:24.750 --> 05:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
you are out so those two pieces if
 
05:34:26.628 --> 05:34:26.638 align:start position:0%
you're subject to those you can't go to
 
05:34:26.638 --> 05:34:27.590 align:start position:0%
you're subject to those you can't go to
two

05:34:27.590 --> 05:34:27.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
units um the next uh number two in the
 
05:34:34.110 --> 05:34:34.120 align:start position:0%
bill this is line 14 uh the proposed
 
05:34:35.430 --> 05:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
Housing Development does not allow
 
05:34:38.390 --> 05:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
demolition of more than 25% of existing
 
05:34:41.150 --> 05:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
exterior structural walls unless the
 
05:34:42.708 --> 05:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
Housing Development meets at least one
 
05:34:44.030 --> 05:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the following conditions which are
 
05:34:46.510 --> 05:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
the exceptions so 25% of your exterior
 
05:34:48.830 --> 05:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
walls would mean that if you have four
 
05:34:50.430 --> 05:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
exterior walls and the building is a
 
05:34:52.628 --> 05:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
perfect square and plan you can only
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
blow out one of those of the four
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
exterior walls so let's just say it's a
 
05:35:01.030 --> 05:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
20 20 20 20 square 20 ft on each side
 
05:35:02.990 --> 05:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
you can only blow out one of those 20ft
 
05:35:04.628 --> 05:35:04.638 align:start position:0%
walls so that would mean that you can't
 
05:35:07.150 --> 05:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
be expanding on two sides um unless
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
you've got an exception so the
 
05:35:10.670 --> 05:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions to the
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
25% demo is if a local ordinance so
 
05:35:16.990 --> 05:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
allows so there may be some local
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
ordinances that will let you do more
 
05:35:23.310 --> 05:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
than 25% demo or the site has not been
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
occupied by a tenant in the last three
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
years so once again if either of those
 
05:35:31.830 --> 05:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
are um the case then you can get past
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
the 25% demolition limit uh Point number
 
05:35:38.590 --> 05:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
three the development is not located
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
within a historic district or is
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
designated or listed as a state or
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
national landmark or historic property
 
05:35:47.510 --> 05:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
so if your town has taken the effort of
 
05:35:49.948 --> 05:35:49.958 align:start position:0%
designating national landmark historic
 
05:35:53.230 --> 05:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
historic district Etc then you are out
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
your property cannot have this second
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
unit Point number four development is
 
05:36:01.310 --> 05:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
located outside side of Hazard areas as
 
05:36:04.310 --> 05:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
identified by either a hazard risk map
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
or a risk factor rating of minimal for
 
05:36:09.750 --> 05:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
flood and fire risk uh so once again you
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
are allowed to do your second unit but
 
05:36:13.548 --> 05:36:13.558 align:start position:0%
you need to be outside of a hazard risk
 
05:36:15.310 --> 05:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
area so uh we've been having some
 
05:36:17.590 --> 05:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
flooding on the Sea Coast there are some
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about future development in
 
05:36:21.868 --> 05:36:21.878 align:start position:0%
areas that are already heavily flooding
 
05:36:24.868 --> 05:36:24.878 align:start position:0%
uh and so with that in mind uh something
 
05:36:27.030 --> 05:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
like that would probably fall outside of
 
05:36:28.830 --> 05:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to put in a second unit
 
05:36:30.390 --> 05:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
because of your current current concerns
 
05:36:30.400 --> 05:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
because of your current current concerns
about

05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:36:34.070 --> 05:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
flooding uh so then we go on to say
 
05:36:35.948 --> 05:36:35.958 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any local ordinance or
 
05:36:38.150 --> 05:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
bylaw and except as provided in the
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
earlier paragraph Tob your planning
 
05:36:42.948 --> 05:36:42.958 align:start position:0%
board May impose objective zoning
 
05:36:44.910 --> 05:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision and design review standards
 
05:36:47.110 --> 05:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
that don't conflict with this paragraph
 
05:36:50.270 --> 05:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
So some examples of that may be um side
 
05:36:52.830 --> 05:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
yard setbacks front yard setbacks things
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
that they already have on the books for
 
05:36:56.708 --> 05:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
having to conform to how big your
 
05:36:59.150 --> 05:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
structure is uh most towns and cities
 
05:37:00.670 --> 05:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
that have requirement we'll say it can't
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
be more than 2 and a half stories or 35
 
05:37:05.788 --> 05:37:05.798 align:start position:0%
ft all of these things can and do still
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
apply so you can't just come in and do
 
05:37:09.948 --> 05:37:09.958 align:start position:0%
your second unit and go up five stories
 
05:37:11.590 --> 05:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
you won't would not be able to do that
 
05:37:13.230 --> 05:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
because there may be a local ordinance
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
that limits that and that still
 
05:37:19.628 --> 05:37:19.638 align:start position:0%
stands um going to 2A line 29 the
 
05:37:21.750 --> 05:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
planning board shall not impose
 
05:37:23.350 --> 05:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
objective zoning subdivision and
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
objective design review standards that
 
05:37:26.708 --> 05:37:26.718 align:start position:0%
would have the effect of physically
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
precluding construction of up to two
 
05:37:31.548 --> 05:37:31.558 align:start position:0%
units and being at least a th000 square
 
05:37:35.548 --> 05:37:35.558 align:start position:0%
feet in floor area so you can't prevent
 
05:37:37.390 --> 05:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
the construction of the two units and a
 
05:37:39.590 --> 05:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
th000 square feet in floor area provided
 
05:37:41.230 --> 05:37:41.240 align:start position:0%
it meets the checklist we just went
 
05:37:42.830 --> 05:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
through and doesn't get kicked out from
 
05:37:46.110 --> 05:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
criteria so you've got an existing house
 
05:37:50.548 --> 05:37:50.558 align:start position:0%
and you want to add your second unit and
 
05:37:52.910 --> 05:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
you haven't gotten kicked out yet we're
 
05:37:55.390 --> 05:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
on the second page line one not
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding sub paragraph b2a no
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
setback shall be required for an
 
05:38:00.788 --> 05:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
existing structure or a structure
 
05:38:02.628 --> 05:38:02.638 align:start position:0%
constructed in the same location and to
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
the same dimensions as an existing
 
05:38:06.750 --> 05:38:06.760 align:start position:0%
structure so your grandfathered in if
 
05:38:08.590 --> 05:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
you've already got this uh Victorian
 
05:38:10.510 --> 05:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
that's built right up to the lot line um
 
05:38:12.628 --> 05:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
in a downtown site you're not going to
 
05:38:14.150 --> 05:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
be forced to have a setback if you're
 
05:38:16.510 --> 05:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
adding in um another
 
05:38:19.470 --> 05:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
unit moving on not withstanding that
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
paragraph above all other circumstances
 
05:38:23.910 --> 05:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
not described in uh the previous
 
05:38:26.390 --> 05:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
discussion about planning and zoning a
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
planning board may require a setback of
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
up to 4 F feet from the side and rear
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
lot lines so if there isn't one now the
 
05:38:37.230 --> 05:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
the planning board may add one in and
 
05:38:39.948 --> 05:38:39.958 align:start position:0%
say we need that 4 foot offset from side
 
05:38:42.948 --> 05:38:42.958 align:start position:0%
and rear lot lines so in addition to the
 
05:38:45.270 --> 05:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
conditions established a planning board
 
05:38:46.750 --> 05:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
may require any of the following
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
conditions when considering application
 
05:38:50.310 --> 05:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
for two residential units as provided
 
05:38:52.830 --> 05:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
for in this section um a planning board
 
05:38:54.430 --> 05:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
may require that there's off street
 
05:38:57.270 --> 05:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
parking for up to one space per unit so
 
05:38:58.948 --> 05:38:58.958 align:start position:0%
if you already have a pretty small lot
 
05:39:00.990 --> 05:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
let's say we got a downtown quarter acre
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
lot there's an existing house there's a
 
05:39:06.510 --> 05:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
teeny tiny little driveway and you'd
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
like to put a little bump out in the
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
back to do your second unit there can be
 
05:39:12.910 --> 05:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
a requirement for off street parking for
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
one space per unit so you'll need to
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
figure out where to get that extension
 
05:39:17.868 --> 05:39:17.878 align:start position:0%
of the driveway for the second parking
 
05:39:20.430 --> 05:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
space for the second unit and then of
 
05:39:22.750 --> 05:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
course um we had all kinds of discussion
 
05:39:24.510 --> 05:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
about the four PLU is a house bill what
 
05:39:26.750 --> 05:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
do we do about Wastewater um and
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
specifically for cities and towns that
 
05:39:30.310 --> 05:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
have Wastewater issues and cannot handle
 
05:39:31.830 --> 05:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
the capacity that they currently are
 
05:39:34.990 --> 05:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with um so this is a discussion
 
05:39:36.708 --> 05:39:36.718 align:start position:0%
and a plan for how to deal with
 
05:39:36.718 --> 05:39:37.750 align:start position:0%
and a plan for how to deal with
Wastewater

05:39:37.750 --> 05:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
05:39:41.270 --> 05:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
concerns so obviously if you don't have
 
05:39:44.468 --> 05:39:44.478 align:start position:0%
a city sewer City Water um it's a
 
05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
different test than if you do for
 
05:39:48.788 --> 05:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
example residential units connected to
 
05:39:51.590 --> 05:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
an on-site wastewater treatment system a
 
05:39:54.150 --> 05:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
perk test completed within 5 years can
 
05:39:56.670 --> 05:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
be required by the town or if the perk
 
05:39:58.310 --> 05:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
test has been recertified within the
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
last 10 years we're not trying to create
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
an undue burden to someone who has an
 
05:40:03.628 --> 05:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
existing house and wants to add a second
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
unit but we do want to make sure that
 
05:40:08.628 --> 05:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
the water is still good um if the
 
05:40:09.868 --> 05:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
municipality is proven through
 
05:40:11.468 --> 05:40:11.478 align:start position:0%
engineering study that it does not have
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
adequate Water and Sewer city of NASA
 
05:40:16.430 --> 05:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
and to allow this development two units
 
05:40:18.510 --> 05:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
may be disallowed by the planning board
 
05:40:21.310 --> 05:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
for a term of up to 10 years but after
 
05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
the expiration of that term it must be
 
05:40:25.628 --> 05:40:25.638 align:start position:0%
allowed so it gives a period of time for
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
a city or town to get their act together
 
05:40:29.548 --> 05:40:29.558 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they're still
 
05:40:31.548 --> 05:40:31.558 align:start position:0%
allowing housing to happen there but
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
they've got a 10e stay from that would
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
be from the term of 10 years the
 
05:40:38.670 --> 05:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
intention here is from the time the
 
05:40:40.750 --> 05:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
applicant requests the second unit so
 
05:40:42.548 --> 05:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
they're sort of a rolling clock you've
 
05:40:44.390 --> 05:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
got to get your act together in 10 years
 
05:40:46.910 --> 05:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
to allow that um but I I understand that
 
05:40:48.150 --> 05:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
there are some cities and towns where
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's just not possible right now to do
 
05:40:51.270 --> 05:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
additional uh
 
05:40:53.990 --> 05:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
units so not withstanding the subar
 
05:40:56.270 --> 05:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph a a planning board may deny a
 
05:40:57.628 --> 05:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
proposed Housing Development if the
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
building official makes a written
 
05:41:02.070 --> 05:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
finding based upon a preponderance of
 
05:41:03.628 --> 05:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
the evidence that the proposed housing
 
05:41:05.628 --> 05:41:05.638 align:start position:0%
development project under this paragraph
 
05:41:08.868 --> 05:41:08.878 align:start position:0%
would have a specific adverse impact
 
05:41:11.110 --> 05:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
upon public health and safety or the
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
physical environment and for which there
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
is no feasible method to satisfactorily
 
05:41:17.830 --> 05:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate or avoid that specific adverse
 
05:41:19.948 --> 05:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
impact and certainly we've seen some
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
concerns in The Lakes Region when it
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
comes to septic sewage um issues with
 
05:41:26.628 --> 05:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
dealing with an additional unit and the
 
05:41:28.948 --> 05:41:28.958 align:start position:0%
strain that that may cause especially if
 
05:41:32.708 --> 05:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
there is no um there's no town or city
 
05:41:35.190 --> 05:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
provided sewer um and so we don't want
 
05:41:37.590 --> 05:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
to be creating issues with green algae
 
05:41:39.628 --> 05:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
in our beautiful lakes and
 
05:41:41.910 --> 05:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
ponds that's just an example I'm sure
 
05:41:43.468 --> 05:41:43.478 align:start position:0%
there are many other things that towns
 
05:41:46.350 --> 05:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
may find that are specific to them so a
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
planning board may require that a rental
 
05:41:50.350 --> 05:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
of any unit created pursuant to this
 
05:41:52.510 --> 05:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph be for a term longer than 30
 
05:41:54.628 --> 05:41:54.638 align:start position:0%
days we've received concerns about
 
05:41:57.070 --> 05:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals I know Conway just
 
05:41:59.190 --> 05:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
had a big lawsuit last year about
 
05:42:00.830 --> 05:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
finding short-term rentals and what that
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
means for development in the town uh and
 
05:42:06.150 --> 05:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
so really uh we're allowing the towns to
 
05:42:07.948 --> 05:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
push for if you're doing a second unit
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
it can't be a short-term
 
05:42:12.390 --> 05:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
rental um and finally application shall
 
05:42:13.910 --> 05:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
not be rejected solely because it
 
05:42:15.628 --> 05:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
proposes adjacent or connected
 
05:42:17.310 --> 05:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
structures provided that the structures
 
05:42:19.590 --> 05:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
meet building codes safety standards and
 
05:42:21.390 --> 05:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
are sufficient to allow separate
 
05:42:25.110 --> 05:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
conveyance um so obviously if you're
 
05:42:27.788 --> 05:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
doing something that the town officials
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
may be concerned about fire code uh or
 
05:42:32.030 --> 05:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
other safety standards then there would
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
be a conversation about making sure that
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
you meet those requirements uh but it
 
05:42:37.548 --> 05:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
can't be rejected out of hand just
 
05:42:39.230 --> 05:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
because of those concerns there needs to
 
05:42:41.670 --> 05:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
be a way to still get your second
 
05:42:44.350 --> 05:42:44.360 align:start position:0%
unit uh at the end a municipality may
 
05:42:45.868 --> 05:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
require that any or all residential
 
05:42:47.150 --> 05:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
units built under the terms of this
 
05:42:48.548 --> 05:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
section shall meet the definition of
 
05:42:53.670 --> 05:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing uh RSA 674 colon 58
 
05:42:57.190 --> 05:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 as it pertains to rental housing
 
05:42:58.548 --> 05:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
and shall meet the definition of
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
affordable in RSA 674 col 58 Romans 1 a
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
municipality may require restrictive
 
05:43:07.190 --> 05:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
covenant to be recorded in the registry
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
of deeds to enforce compliance with
 
05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
these definitions and so this allows
 
05:43:13.150 --> 05:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that really do want to
 
05:43:15.070 --> 05:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
start putting in a percentage goal for
 
05:43:17.070 --> 05:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing to say all right if
 
05:43:18.788 --> 05:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow a second unit and
 
05:43:21.390 --> 05:43:21.400 align:start position:0%
50% of our residential zoning we want to
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that that is definitely
 
05:43:25.070 --> 05:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing um so that is the
 
05:43:27.670 --> 05:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm absolutely happy to
 
05:43:29.310 --> 05:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
answer questions I understand understand
 
05:43:30.910 --> 05:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
that this is a bit of a change from the
 
05:43:33.150 --> 05:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
initial proposal but I think that it's
 
05:43:34.830 --> 05:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
pretty well negotiated and discussed
 
05:43:37.390 --> 05:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
with the stakeholders so I'm open for
 
05:43:39.948 --> 05:43:39.958 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm gonna um start off
 
05:43:39.958 --> 05:43:42.510 align:start position:0%
questions okay I'm gonna um start off
representative

05:43:42.510 --> 05:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams
 
05:43:51.548 --> 05:43:51.558 align:start position:0%
um assuming I followed you correctly uh
 
05:43:54.190 --> 05:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
this proposal would allow a total of two
 
05:43:56.468 --> 05:43:56.478 align:start position:0%
units where there had previously been
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
one under various circumstances you have
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
described so my questions are how does
 
05:44:07.628 --> 05:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
that relate first of all to the existing
 
05:44:10.910 --> 05:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh accessory D accessory dwell leg unit
 
05:44:14.350 --> 05:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
statute and then how does it relate to
 
05:44:15.590 --> 05:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:44:19.270 --> 05:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
1291 which would allow a total of three
 
05:44:21.270 --> 05:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
units thank you very much for the
 
05:44:23.510 --> 05:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
question I'll start with the first one
 
05:44:25.390 --> 05:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
um the intent here with this bill is to
 
05:44:28.270 --> 05:44:28.280 align:start position:0%
allow you to take an existing house and
 
05:44:29.868 --> 05:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
either put an addition ition on it or
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
subdivide it let's just say it naturally
 
05:44:33.708 --> 05:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
lends itself to having a second
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
staircase and the upper portion of it to
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
be a separate unit um that truly is its
 
05:44:41.310 --> 05:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
own apartment and address we're not
 
05:44:42.868 --> 05:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
calling it an accessory dwelling unit
 
05:44:45.628 --> 05:44:45.638 align:start position:0%
we're calling it unit number two uh and
 
05:44:47.670 --> 05:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
so there are probably people who are way
 
05:44:49.230 --> 05:44:49.240 align:start position:0%
better at explaining this than me who
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
will testify after me about this but the
 
05:44:54.468 --> 05:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
intent here is to make it um an actual
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
unit as opposed to accessory unit um and
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
so I want it to be addressed distinctly
 
05:45:02.990 --> 05:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
and differently um in terms of your
 
05:45:05.430 --> 05:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
second question about the three unit
 
05:45:08.030 --> 05:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
bill um I'm not as familiar with that so
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
I'm probably not going to be able to do
 
05:45:11.310 --> 05:45:11.320 align:start position:0%
you justice on comparing the two but I'm
 
05:45:13.070 --> 05:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
happy to send an email afterwards when
 
05:45:17.070 --> 05:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
I've had some time to digest it thank
 
05:45:19.430 --> 05:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
05:45:22.030 --> 05:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
Kell thank you
 
05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for uh your detailed
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
presentation as we just got the language
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
in front front of us
 
05:45:36.750 --> 05:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
um my cons uh I guess what if
 
05:45:40.230 --> 05:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
anything um or do you have the concerns
 
05:45:43.270 --> 05:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
as far as accessory like when we have
 
05:45:45.590 --> 05:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
put in the laws like requiring accessory
 
05:45:47.548 --> 05:45:47.558 align:start position:0%
dwelling units and you can have you have
 
05:45:49.390 --> 05:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to allow them in certain
 
05:45:53.310 --> 05:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
situations etc etc um
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities essentially took that as
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
a blueprint of this is when we're going
 
05:45:59.390 --> 05:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
to allow accessory
 
05:46:03.590 --> 05:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
dwellings um do you have that same
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
concern that municipalities who may
 
05:46:09.468 --> 05:46:09.478 align:start position:0%
currently allow
 
05:46:14.590 --> 05:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
duplexes um could take this law and say
 
05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
okay you can have duplexes if you meet
 
05:46:19.868 --> 05:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
all of these criteria and that's the
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
only time that you can have duplexes
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
essentially making
 
05:46:26.868 --> 05:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
it way harder than it currently is to
 
05:46:30.310 --> 05:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
have duplicates um
 
05:46:32.708 --> 05:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
do do you see anything in this that
 
05:46:36.750 --> 05:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
would say like you know there's this is
 
05:46:39.788 --> 05:46:39.798 align:start position:0%
in addition to um you know your current
 
05:46:43.990 --> 05:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
like transferring one one singles you
 
05:46:47.070 --> 05:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
know uh family dwelling into multif
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
family or is this just a blueprint for
 
05:46:51.440 --> 05:46:53.350 align:start position:0%
family or is this just a blueprint for
eliminating

05:46:53.350 --> 05:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
05:46:55.548 --> 05:46:55.558 align:start position:0%
duplexes thank you so much for the
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
question um so I was very specific um on
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
line six page one of the amendment where
 
05:47:05.510 --> 05:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
we talk about zoned for single family
 
05:47:07.910 --> 05:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
residences right so we're really talking
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
about um R1 single family zoning
 
05:47:14.468 --> 05:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
generally uh and so if you have duplexes
 
05:47:17.310 --> 05:47:17.320 align:start position:0%
already in single family residential it
 
05:47:20.510 --> 05:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
may have been rezoned to get there um
 
05:47:23.030 --> 05:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
but the intent here is to stretch single
 
05:47:25.910 --> 05:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
family to Encompass plus one if we meet
 
05:47:28.590 --> 05:47:28.600 align:start position:0%
all the checklist criteria um in terms
 
05:47:31.468 --> 05:47:31.478 align:start position:0%
of of being able to do duplexes uh right
 
05:47:33.590 --> 05:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to do a mirrored two equal
 
05:47:36.270 --> 05:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
units on a lot that's zoned single
 
05:47:38.830 --> 05:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
family residential this would allow that
 
05:47:41.310 --> 05:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
to happen you could purchase a lot
 
05:47:43.150 --> 05:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
single family residential that meets all
 
05:47:45.708 --> 05:47:45.718 align:start position:0%
the checklist criteria and construct a
 
05:47:48.430 --> 05:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
duplex side by side or top and bottom
 
05:47:50.590 --> 05:47:50.600 align:start position:0%
either way um because it meets the
 
05:47:53.430 --> 05:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
criteria and it's two units so it's
 
05:47:55.270 --> 05:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
basically stretching single family
 
05:47:57.150 --> 05:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
residential with all the criteria met
 
05:48:00.590 --> 05:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
for 50% of the lot in the municipality
 
05:48:03.628 --> 05:48:03.638 align:start position:0%
to allow that duplex to happen but I'm
 
05:48:05.750 --> 05:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
not saying it has to be a duplex because
 
05:48:08.150 --> 05:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the size of the second unit is left
 
05:48:10.948 --> 05:48:10.958 align:start position:0%
intentionally vague but you can always
 
05:48:13.788 --> 05:48:13.798 align:start position:0%
do at least a th000 square feet right
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
because we're allowing a th000 square
 
05:48:18.350 --> 05:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
feet on line 31 you could obviously do
 
05:48:20.310 --> 05:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
more if it's allowed under the base
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
zoning right in terms of lot area um
 
05:48:25.948 --> 05:48:25.958 align:start position:0%
total footprint of the building um sidey
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
yard setbacks all the other constraints
 
05:48:29.150 --> 05:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
you have to work with when you're doing
 
05:48:31.270 --> 05:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh a renovation addition new
 
05:48:33.590 --> 05:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
construction you still have those same s
 
05:48:34.670 --> 05:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh site
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
requirements um but I think the purpose
 
05:48:39.628 --> 05:48:39.638 align:start position:0%
here is not so much about saying new
 
05:48:41.548 --> 05:48:41.558 align:start position:0%
construction duplexes the purpose here
 
05:48:43.868 --> 05:48:43.878 align:start position:0%
is you get another unit if you meet the
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
criteria so I hope that answers your
 
05:48:46.830 --> 05:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
question but I'm happy to take it
 
05:48:50.830 --> 05:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:52.788 --> 05:48:52.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't I have a different question
 
05:48:55.670 --> 05:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
please be as brief as possible thank
 
05:48:55.680 --> 05:48:57.510 align:start position:0%
please be as brief as possible thank
you

05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:48:57.520 --> 05:48:59.990 align:start position:0%
you
um

05:48:59.990 --> 05:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:04.708 --> 05:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
when on line one it says um at least 50%
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
of the Lots in a municipality zone for
 
05:49:08.670 --> 05:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
single family
 
05:49:08.680 --> 05:49:11.670 align:start position:0%
single family
residences

05:49:11.670 --> 05:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
residences
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
um or a line line six 5 to six sorry um
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
the which Lots is the 50% are are you
 
05:49:24.868 --> 05:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
imagining a Zone created by the
 
05:49:27.788 --> 05:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
municipality that these are the 50% or
 
05:49:29.788 --> 05:49:29.798 align:start position:0%
are you just like like the first 50%
 
05:49:33.270 --> 05:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
that apply or how how is that 50% are
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
you imagining that uh you know to that's
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um I think that
 
05:49:42.468 --> 05:49:42.478 align:start position:0%
it's sort of self selecting and I say
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
that because we have an awful lot of
 
05:49:46.750 --> 05:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
things that kick you out right we have
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the issues with covenants ordinance
 
05:49:53.510 --> 05:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
restricting rent um affordable housing
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
right so if you already have an
 
05:49:54.638 --> 05:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
right so if you already have an
affordable

05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
05:49:59.830 --> 05:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
housing rule on the books then that
 
05:50:01.548 --> 05:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
single family housing Zone with
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing is already out so for
 
05:50:07.070 --> 05:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
your town that piece is not part of the
 
05:50:09.750 --> 05:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
50% Target that we need to achieve right
 
05:50:12.070 --> 05:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it's sort of self- selecting um and
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
the same thing with if you have a
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
historic district that's also single
 
05:50:17.708 --> 05:50:17.718 align:start position:0%
family residential that piece is out of
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
the 50% already so you have to look
 
05:50:27.430 --> 05:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:27.440 --> 05:50:31.230 align:start position:0%
 
goal

05:50:31.230 --> 05:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.510 --> 05:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you Mr chair
 
05:50:37.468 --> 05:50:37.478 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
05:50:39.350 --> 05:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
in relation to both representative yella
 
05:50:41.150 --> 05:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
and representative Gibbs questions it is
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding and my question is is
 
05:50:46.390 --> 05:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
this correct in your understanding that
 
05:50:48.750 --> 05:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
the difference here between this bill
 
05:50:52.030 --> 05:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
and the upcoming Adu bill which is mine
 
05:50:54.430 --> 05:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
um is that this bill because this
 
05:50:56.230 --> 05:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee has heard extensive uh
 
05:50:59.350 --> 05:50:59.360 align:start position:0%
presentation on the benefit of duplexes
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they are um unfairly
 
05:51:06.788 --> 05:51:06.798 align:start position:0%
zoned out and we we need more duplexes
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
in the state they are part of that
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
missing middle that was referenced
 
05:51:11.868 --> 05:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
earlier and so that this would allow
 
05:51:14.548 --> 05:51:14.558 align:start position:0%
duplexes which are different from adus
 
05:51:16.430 --> 05:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
because for a couple things one they
 
05:51:18.628 --> 05:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
aren't restricted to the size that adus
 
05:51:22.070 --> 05:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
are restricted to and um two um your
 
05:51:24.070 --> 05:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
bill would specifically allow developers
 
05:51:26.468 --> 05:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
to develop it whereas the Adu law as it
 
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
exists will allow allows municipalities
 
05:51:32.030 --> 05:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
to limit to owner
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
occupants thank you so much for the
 
05:51:36.468 --> 05:51:36.478 align:start position:0%
layup yes and
 
05:51:38.670 --> 05:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
yes um and and I think it's really
 
05:51:40.390 --> 05:51:40.400 align:start position:0%
important to distinguish that the intent
 
05:51:42.548 --> 05:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
here is to get to missing middle housing
 
05:51:44.910 --> 05:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
and and the the purpose here is that we
 
05:51:46.750 --> 05:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you can have two units
 
05:51:48.190 --> 05:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
where otherwise it would only be one
 
05:51:50.390 --> 05:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
unit and won only ever be one unit but
 
05:51:52.110 --> 05:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
we're sort of piercing the veil of
 
05:51:54.030 --> 05:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
single family residential and allowing
 
05:51:55.990 --> 05:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
it to be to once it meets all these
 
05:51:57.270 --> 05:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
criteria for
 
05:51:57.280 --> 05:51:59.670 align:start position:0%
criteria for
50%

05:51:59.670 --> 05:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
50%
 
05:52:02.548 --> 05:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
briefly please briefly is it also your
 
05:52:04.350 --> 05:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh while the
 
05:52:07.430 --> 05:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
underlying bill as introduced said that
 
05:52:11.190 --> 05:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
all the Lots would allow this extra unit
 
05:52:13.070 --> 05:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
to be built essentially creating
 
05:52:17.030 --> 05:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
potentially a duplex that um the reason
 
05:52:20.590 --> 05:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment amends it down to all lots
 
05:52:23.030 --> 05:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
of two acres and in any case at least
 
05:52:26.430 --> 05:52:26.440 align:start position:0%
50% was to allow the towns to protect
 
05:52:29.070 --> 05:52:29.080 align:start position:0%
agricultural areas um which may be
 
05:52:31.868 --> 05:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
beneficial from an environmental
 
05:52:33.868 --> 05:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
standpoint thank you for the question
 
05:52:35.788 --> 05:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
yes agricultural is certainly a concern
 
05:52:37.670 --> 05:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
I would also add our Timber lots to that
 
05:52:39.788 --> 05:52:39.798 align:start position:0%
as well um we have an awful lot of green
 
05:52:41.310 --> 05:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
space in New Hampshire that we want to
 
05:52:43.750 --> 05:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
preserve and certainly we do have other
 
05:52:44.990 --> 05:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
things that are priorities in the
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
checklist like historic districts um and
 
05:52:50.430 --> 05:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh special areas for affordable
 
05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:57.150 --> 05:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:53:00.590 --> 05:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you um I have a question on
 
05:53:02.230 --> 05:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
a different subject than
 
05:53:07.390 --> 05:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
earlier uh where it says um uh that uh
 
05:53:09.868 --> 05:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
the development is not located within a
 
05:53:13.070 --> 05:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
historic district or is designated or
 
05:53:16.270 --> 05:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
listed uh as a landmark or historic
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
property um that sounds like uh you
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
can't do it if it's located within a
 
05:53:26.150 --> 05:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
historic district but you can do it if
 
05:53:29.430 --> 05:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's designated um as a landmark or
 
05:53:32.430 --> 05:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
historic property did you mean not in a
 
05:53:36.350 --> 05:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
historic district and not designated a
 
05:53:39.670 --> 05:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
Landmark thank you so much for the
 
05:53:43.150 --> 05:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
question uh when we look at this is line
 
05:53:46.150 --> 05:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
19 uh parentheses 3 and
 
05:53:48.548 --> 05:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
parenthesis we're going all the way back
 
05:53:51.430 --> 05:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
up to line eight where it says if the
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
proposed Housing Development meets all
 
05:53:55.788 --> 05:53:55.798 align:start position:0%
of the following requirements so if you
 
05:53:58.990 --> 05:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
jump from line 8 to line 19
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're reading this as if the proposed
 
05:54:03.150 --> 05:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
Housing Development meets all the
 
05:54:06.230 --> 05:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
following requirements and this one is
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh number three the development is not
 
05:54:10.830 --> 05:54:10.840 align:start position:0%
located within a historic district or is
 
05:54:13.548 --> 05:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
and it should say not that was my
 
05:54:15.468 --> 05:54:15.478 align:start position:0%
question designated or listed as a state
 
05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
or national landmark or historic
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
property so that should say not it
 
05:54:21.390 --> 05:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
should say not because obviously we're
 
05:54:24.830 --> 05:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
not looking to to preclude listed or
 
05:54:26.468 --> 05:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
State national landmark or historic
 
05:54:29.910 --> 05:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
property yes thank you
 
05:54:32.110 --> 05:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
05:54:35.708 --> 05:54:35.718 align:start position:0%
makoni thank you Mr chairman if um turn
 
05:54:38.910 --> 05:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
your attention to page two line
 
05:54:42.390 --> 05:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
seven uh C in addition to any conditions
 
05:54:44.628 --> 05:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
established in accordance with
 
05:54:47.070 --> 05:54:47.080 align:start position:0%
subparagraph I wish I could read as fast
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
as you uh
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
representative um a planning board may
 
05:54:53.510 --> 05:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
require any of the following conditions
 
05:54:55.868 --> 05:54:55.878 align:start position:0%
when considering an application for two
 
05:54:59.548 --> 05:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
residential units and I item 11 uh item
 
05:55:01.948 --> 05:55:01.958 align:start position:0%
number two on 11 says for residential
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
units connected to an on-site wastewater
 
05:55:07.230 --> 05:55:07.240 align:start position:0%
treatment system a septic system I
 
05:55:09.070 --> 05:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
believe is what we're is proposed to a
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
municipality yep a percolation test
 
05:55:15.750 --> 05:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
completed within the last five years if
 
05:55:18.830 --> 05:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
the percolation test has been
 
05:55:22.270 --> 05:55:22.280 align:start position:0%
recertified within 10 years what what
 
05:55:24.070 --> 05:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
are you telling me in that language
 
05:55:26.310 --> 05:55:26.320 align:start position:0%
because I I think you need some work and
 
05:55:29.150 --> 05:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'd be willing to help or or send you to
 
05:55:31.830 --> 05:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
subsurface absolutely um the intent here
 
05:55:34.030 --> 05:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
is that you have existing septic already
 
05:55:36.548 --> 05:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
and you know you're adding another unit
 
05:55:38.150 --> 05:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
so we need to do a perk test for your
 
05:55:40.590 --> 05:55:40.600 align:start position:0%
existing septic or provide the perk test
 
05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
within the last five years or if it's
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
older than that it's been recertified
 
05:55:46.548 --> 05:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
within the last 10 years to show that
 
05:55:49.430 --> 05:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
you can handle the uh increased demand
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
and this is allowing the municipality to
 
05:55:55.468 --> 05:55:55.478 align:start position:0%
request the perk test if they want it I
 
05:55:58.670 --> 05:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
if if I could I I might suggest that you
 
05:56:00.750 --> 05:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
look at that language I think you you
 
05:56:04.270 --> 05:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
need to talk about a uh an Adu is
 
05:56:06.468 --> 05:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
allowed by right but you have to you
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
have to have a um a in-pocket
 
05:56:13.628 --> 05:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
subsurface approval for the septic
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
system in the event that the current
 
05:56:19.990 --> 05:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
system fails it's a septic system and a
 
05:56:23.150 --> 05:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
permit but for subsurface not a perk
 
05:56:26.628 --> 05:56:26.638 align:start position:0%
test a perk test uh being a practitioner
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
a perk test is just digging a hole and
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
seeing what the soil is I I think I
 
05:56:34.150 --> 05:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
think you want to some somehow
 
05:56:36.708 --> 05:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
substitute in there that meets current
 
05:56:39.708 --> 05:56:39.718 align:start position:0%
subsurface regulations I don't I don't
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
think the Department's going to be as
 
05:56:46.628 --> 05:56:46.638 align:start position:0%
forgiving as they were with adus so um
 
05:56:50.070 --> 05:56:50.080 align:start position:0%
the towns are going to want to know
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
subsurface going to want to know that it
 
05:56:53.868 --> 05:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
can handle that additional
 
05:56:57.510 --> 05:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
flow love it if there is to help yes
 
05:56:58.510 --> 05:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if there's
 
05:56:59.788 --> 05:56:59.798 align:start position:0%
additional feedback we'll definitely be
 
05:57:01.788 --> 05:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
having a work session on this and I will
 
05:57:03.868 --> 05:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
invite up represent MC Williams to chat
 
05:57:05.868 --> 05:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
with the committee about that um are
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
there any other questions for the prime
 
05:57:11.430 --> 05:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor seeing none thank you thank you
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%

here um if there is anyone here that is
 
05:57:25.110 --> 05:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
specifically testifying on 1291 I
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
overestimated or underestimated how much
 
05:57:29.830 --> 05:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
time these hearings would take um and i'
 
05:57:31.910 --> 05:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
prefer not to make uh General Court
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
staff stay here past 5:00 P p.m. on a

week okay my apologies to everyone that
 
05:57:52.990 --> 05:57:53.000 align:start position:0%

05:57:55.150 --> 05:57:55.160 align:start position:0%
time to um dissect this and I want to
 
05:57:57.310 --> 05:57:57.320 align:start position:0%

are online we'd love to hear your
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
feedback thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:58:21.628 --> 05:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
05:58:23.548 --> 05:58:23.558 align:start position:0%
Alysa margal and housing action New
 
05:58:27.230 --> 05:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we were uh supporters of
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
the for Flex bill um that had been
 
05:58:32.910 --> 05:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
introduced by um former representative
 
05:58:34.750 --> 05:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
van and then by representative Mick
 
05:58:36.670 --> 05:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
Williams and what we learned in that
 
05:58:38.590 --> 05:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
advocacy is that there were a ton of
 
05:58:40.948 --> 05:58:40.958 align:start position:0%
questions and the bill before you does
 
05:58:43.990 --> 05:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of addressing so many
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders concerns what we
 
05:58:48.830 --> 05:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
heard from many members was that it
 
05:58:52.750 --> 05:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't concern about allowing for a
 
05:58:54.750 --> 05:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
duplex on a single family property
 
05:58:56.708 --> 05:58:56.718 align:start position:0%
rather it was all these other uh
 
05:58:58.270 --> 05:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
potential issues
 
05:59:01.030 --> 05:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
in addition I want to note that um this
 
05:59:05.230 --> 05:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
is also uh consistent with what was um
 
05:59:08.830 --> 05:59:08.840 align:start position:0%
considered uh how the fourplex bill was
 
05:59:11.390 --> 05:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
adopted in the state of Maine um housing
 
05:59:12.830 --> 05:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
action New Hampshire provides
 
05:59:14.670 --> 05:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
administrative support to the
 
05:59:16.910 --> 05:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislative housing caucus and we
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
brought um some legislators who led um
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
the zoning Reform Bill LD 2003 and they
 
05:59:26.190 --> 05:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
took a similar approach uh to what
 
05:59:28.350 --> 05:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams has uh before
 
05:59:33.230 --> 05:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
you here by only allowing um this uh
 
05:59:36.230 --> 05:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
Missing middle housing in um Urban
 
05:59:38.990 --> 05:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
growth areas um we think this bill
 
05:59:40.590 --> 05:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
really addresses all so many of the
 
05:59:42.548 --> 05:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
concerns that we heard and we we urge
 
05:59:43.788 --> 05:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
your support for it and I know you're
 
05:59:45.390 --> 05:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
short on time so I'll conclude my
 
05:59:46.948 --> 05:59:46.958 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much for your
 
05:59:49.628 --> 05:59:49.638 align:start position:0%
testimony other questions for miss
 
05:59:52.468 --> 05:59:52.478 align:start position:0%
marglin seeing none thank you very much
 
05:59:56.548 --> 05:59:56.558 align:start position:0%

06:00:07.110 --> 06:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:09.708 --> 06:00:09.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and it's not
 
06:00:11.070 --> 06:00:11.080 align:start position:0%
evening yet good
 
06:00:14.310 --> 06:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon not yet committee members I'm
 
06:00:15.948 --> 06:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
Ben Frost I'm the deputy executive
 
06:00:17.670 --> 06:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
director and chief legal officer for New
 
06:00:19.708 --> 06:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and I'm here to
 
06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
express our support for this
 
06:00:25.510 --> 06:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
legislation um and um having reviewed
 
06:00:28.750 --> 06:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
the um Amendment um I think most of the
 
06:00:31.868 --> 06:00:31.878 align:start position:0%
comments I had on the bill as introduced
 
06:00:33.990 --> 06:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
also apply to the amendment if not all
 
06:00:37.270 --> 06:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
of them um and let me preface my
 
06:00:41.390 --> 06:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
comments by quickly saying um oftentimes
 
06:00:42.830 --> 06:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
people say they're in support of a bill
 
06:00:45.468 --> 06:00:45.478 align:start position:0%
and then offer criticism that trashes it
 
06:00:48.830 --> 06:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
um these uh uh points I'm about to make
 
06:00:50.910 --> 06:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
are only to improve it and I look
 
06:00:52.270 --> 06:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the sponsor and
 
06:00:54.350 --> 06:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
the committee uh to come up with a
 
06:00:57.510 --> 06:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
really really really good Amendment um
 
06:01:01.070 --> 06:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
first I'll note uh on referring to the
 
06:01:02.868 --> 06:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
amendment this is
 
06:01:06.030 --> 06:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
444h uh line seven on page one uh is the
 
06:01:06.040 --> 06:01:07.628 align:start position:0%
444h uh line seven on page one uh is the
word

06:01:07.628 --> 06:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
word
 
06:01:10.628 --> 06:01:10.638 align:start position:0%
ministerially um I as a lawyer I have a
 
06:01:13.708 --> 06:01:13.718 align:start position:0%
I'm comfortable with what it means but
 
06:01:15.548 --> 06:01:15.558 align:start position:0%
uh it does not occur elsewhere in the
 
06:01:17.390 --> 06:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning statutes I did a
 
06:01:19.788 --> 06:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
quick search this morning and the word
 
06:01:22.390 --> 06:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
ministerial occurs 14 times in the
 
06:01:25.628 --> 06:01:25.638 align:start position:0%
entire body of rsas and it mostly refers
 
06:01:28.190 --> 06:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
to actions dealing with Professional
 
06:01:32.350 --> 06:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
Licensing uh I would encourage um us
 
06:01:34.030 --> 06:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
working together to come up with a a
 
06:01:35.708 --> 06:01:35.718 align:start position:0%
different way of looking at
 
06:01:39.830 --> 06:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
that um also and I think far more
 
06:01:42.990 --> 06:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
importantly is the role of the planning
 
06:01:46.590 --> 06:01:46.600 align:start position:0%
board in all of this uh in there are I
 
06:01:48.150 --> 06:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't know how many references to the
 
06:01:50.270 --> 06:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
planning board uh in both the bill as
 
06:01:51.708 --> 06:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
introduced and in the
 
06:01:55.070 --> 06:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
amendment the planning board does not
 
06:01:58.310 --> 06:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
have statutory jurisdiction over single
 
06:02:00.628 --> 06:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
family homes or
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
duplexes so without actually creating
 
06:02:05.280 --> 06:02:06.190 align:start position:0%
duplexes so without actually creating
that

06:02:06.190 --> 06:02:06.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:09.230 --> 06:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction this legislation assumes
 
06:02:13.150 --> 06:02:13.160 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction that does not exist I
 
06:02:16.270 --> 06:02:16.280 align:start position:0%
think it would probably be better to
 
06:02:20.910 --> 06:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
assign the roles here in this bill to a
 
06:02:20.920 --> 06:02:22.430 align:start position:0%
assign the roles here in this bill to a
building

06:02:22.430 --> 06:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
building
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
inspector uh and that really takes it
 
06:02:28.190 --> 06:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
out of the non
 
06:02:31.270 --> 06:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
ministerial discretionary sorts of viiew
 
06:02:33.830 --> 06:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh what the building inspector does is a
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
ministerial function that is does it
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
meet the code if it does then permit
 
06:02:41.310 --> 06:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
granted no hearing no special
 
06:02:41.320 --> 06:02:44.310 align:start position:0%
granted no hearing no special
process

06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:02:49.030 --> 06:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
um I I think overall I and I understand
 
06:02:52.150 --> 06:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
how hard the sponsor and also uh working
 
06:02:54.788 --> 06:02:54.798 align:start position:0%
with her representative Reed have uh
 
06:02:57.468 --> 06:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
worked to address things that they have
 
06:03:00.350 --> 06:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
seen come up in Prior years
 
06:03:03.788 --> 06:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
hearings um I'm hopeful that we could
 
06:03:07.468 --> 06:03:07.478 align:start position:0%
come up with something that has less
 
06:03:09.788 --> 06:03:09.798 align:start position:0%
conditional stuff in it and let fewer
 
06:03:12.868 --> 06:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
limiting factors and is frankly easier
 
06:03:16.110 --> 06:03:16.120 align:start position:0%
to say yes we can do this we can convert
 
06:03:19.510 --> 06:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
this single family home to a a duplex um
 
06:03:24.788 --> 06:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
I will note uh that um the relationship
 
06:03:26.990 --> 06:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
between accessory the accessory dwelling
 
06:03:31.350 --> 06:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
unit law including I think also house B
 
06:03:35.670 --> 06:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
1291 um is is is pretty easy to dispose
 
06:03:38.030 --> 06:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
of because the accessory dwelling unit
 
06:03:40.910 --> 06:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
law is limited exclusively to single
 
06:03:43.628 --> 06:03:43.638 align:start position:0%
family residences so once you've
 
06:03:45.270 --> 06:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
converted a single family home to a
 
06:03:48.910 --> 06:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
duplex the Adu law no longer
 
06:03:48.920 --> 06:03:51.270 align:start position:0%
duplex the Adu law no longer
applies

06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
applies
 
06:03:53.948 --> 06:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
um representative Gibbs talked about
 
06:03:56.070 --> 06:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
history if you could wrap up that' be my
 
06:03:58.990 --> 06:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
last comment and this is wish um
 
06:04:00.910 --> 06:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs talked about
 
06:04:02.510 --> 06:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
historic districts and that provision
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
there um I please don't hold this
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
against against me I grew up in ipswitch
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um in a house that was
 
06:04:10.510 --> 06:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
built in
 
06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
1707 my mom still lives there um
 
06:04:17.070 --> 06:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
ipswitch is has probably the highest
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
concentration of um pre-ol you know
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
Colonial aromes that were built in the
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
um the uh 18th
 
06:04:30.190 --> 06:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
century uh and earlier in fact the house
 
06:04:31.910 --> 06:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
that was next to the house I grew up in
 
06:04:35.310 --> 06:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
was a duplex built in
 
06:04:38.150 --> 06:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
1650 uh there is no reason why duplexes
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
can't exist in historic districts they
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the same
 
06:04:43.548 --> 06:04:43.558 align:start position:0%
architectural controls that any building
 
06:04:46.110 --> 06:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
would be in such a place thank you thank
 
06:04:47.750 --> 06:04:47.760 align:start position:0%

housing is hard to find today the price
 
06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
of a single family home is higher than
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
ever mortgage rates are as high as they
 
06:08:40.310 --> 06:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
have ever been in a long time and the
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
rental market is saturated which drives
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
up the cost of monthly rents because
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
those who are who would have previously
 
06:08:48.670 --> 06:08:48.680 align:start position:0%
been able to buy a house no longer can

the ability to to be creative about land
 
06:08:53.310 --> 06:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
use policies like the ability to build a
 
06:08:57.150 --> 06:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
duplex and adus will allow for housing
 
06:08:58.910 --> 06:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
at a greater density which will allow
 
06:09:00.990 --> 06:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
rent prices to become more affordable
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
for a young person like me who's grown
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
up in New Hampshire affordable housing
 
06:09:07.030 --> 06:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
means a chance to continue to live and
 
06:09:09.350 --> 06:09:09.360 align:start position:0%

Jane Jane

06:09:40.948 --> 06:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
Lane I asked that if you could keep your
 
06:09:43.270 --> 06:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
remarks specifically to 1399 that'd be
 
06:09:46.708 --> 06:09:46.718 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you uh so my name is Lane
 
06:09:49.030 --> 06:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
um my friend couldn't be here today so
 
06:09:50.468 --> 06:09:50.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be testifying on behalf of
 
06:09:52.708 --> 06:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
him so his name is Jack um he currently
 
06:09:54.510 --> 06:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
lives in KY Maine but he's lived in do
 
06:09:56.750 --> 06:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the majority of his life and he also
 
06:10:00.510 --> 06:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
attended UNH and T and I uh support 1399
 
06:10:01.948 --> 06:10:01.958 align:start position:0%
and also
 
06:10:04.510 --> 06:10:04.520 align:start position:0%
1291 so this is Jack's words I graduated
 
06:10:05.990 --> 06:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
from UNH with a degree in civil
 
06:10:08.070 --> 06:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
engineering and got a job working with
 
06:10:10.548 --> 06:10:10.558 align:start position:0%
the USDA I immediately started looking
 
06:10:12.830 --> 06:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
for a one bedroom or studio apartment in
 
06:10:14.788 --> 06:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
Dober or nearby but there are no
 
06:10:16.990 --> 06:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
affordable options and the few in the
 
06:10:18.350 --> 06:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
few places that I could afford were
 
06:10:20.830 --> 06:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
sketchy and run down it was fortunate
 
06:10:22.230 --> 06:10:22.240 align:start position:0%
that I could stay at my mom's during
 
06:10:24.270 --> 06:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
that incredibly stressful time working
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
for my new job and trying to find out
 
06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out housing the
 
06:10:30.110 --> 06:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
apartment I eventually rented in Dober
 
06:10:33.310 --> 06:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
cost $1,300 a month which is more than
 
06:10:35.548 --> 06:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
half my income at the time spending that
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
much on rent put a lot of pressure on my
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
budget fortunately I stayed healthy or
 
06:10:41.750 --> 06:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
medical situation could have pushed me
 
06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
over the financial Edge now I live in KY
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
Maine with three friends in a house
 
06:10:49.868 --> 06:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
owned by my friend's mom she's renting
 
06:10:52.548 --> 06:10:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh it to us at a below market rate as
 
06:10:54.310 --> 06:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
much as I appreciate having roommates I
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
want to eventually live on my own but
 
06:10:57.868 --> 06:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
the current housing market is too
 
06:10:59.788 --> 06:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
expensive for that the idea of actually
 
06:11:01.230 --> 06:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
owning a home feels completely
 
06:11:02.990 --> 06:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
unattainable for most young people in
 
06:11:05.350 --> 06:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right now I urge you to to
 
06:11:08.468 --> 06:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
support HP 1399 I'd very much like to
 
06:11:10.030 --> 06:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
move back to New Hampshire and be a
 
06:11:11.948 --> 06:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
contributing taxpayer in the state that
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
has always been my home thank you thank
 
06:11:16.670 --> 06:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
06:11:19.430 --> 06:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it thank
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.558 --> 06:11:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
van

06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:38.468 --> 06:11:38.478 align:start position:0%
fourplex Ivy van here to talk to you
 
06:11:41.390 --> 06:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me uh did you did
 
06:11:43.548 --> 06:11:43.558 align:start position:0%
you make that nickname or is that no I
 
06:11:45.270 --> 06:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
have been called fourplex Ivy fan for
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
quite a while now um fourplex is in fact
 
06:11:50.110 --> 06:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
a house but that's not what we're here
 
06:11:53.310 --> 06:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
to talk about today um I don't love this
 
06:11:55.708 --> 06:11:55.718 align:start position:0%
bill as probably doesn't come in as in
 
06:11:58.548 --> 06:11:58.558 align:start position:0%
any Supply surprise to you but the piece
 
06:12:01.030 --> 06:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
of it that I really don't love the two
 
06:12:03.510 --> 06:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
pieces are the piece that Ben Frost
 
06:12:05.750 --> 06:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
identified where you're handing over a
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
whole lot of decisions to the local
 
06:12:11.150 --> 06:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
planning board I think that's a bad call
 
06:12:13.190 --> 06:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's going to be complicated and it's
 
06:12:15.150 --> 06:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
really easy to say you know what we
 
06:12:18.468 --> 06:12:18.478 align:start position:0%
don't understand this so no so I'd like
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
to see that moved over to the code
 
06:12:24.468 --> 06:12:24.478 align:start position:0%
officer these are code issues the second
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
uh concern that I have about this bill
 
06:12:31.310 --> 06:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
is the ability for a town to restrict
 
06:12:33.628 --> 06:12:33.638 align:start position:0%
the new unit to affordable housing and
 
06:12:35.628 --> 06:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
this is not because I hate affordable
 
06:12:39.310 --> 06:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
housing this is because in the current
 
06:12:42.548 --> 06:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
construction Market it may not be
 
06:12:47.110 --> 06:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
possible to create a new unit given the
 
06:12:51.310 --> 06:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
costs of Labor Lumber all of that and
 
06:12:56.830 --> 06:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
rent it at the 60% of area median income
 
06:12:59.868 --> 06:12:59.878 align:start position:0%
which is the be is the bar for what is
 
06:13:03.390 --> 06:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
Affordable Workforce housing so I I hate
 
06:13:05.788 --> 06:13:05.798 align:start position:0%
to see that um I will tell a quick
 
06:13:07.830 --> 06:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
anecdote and then get out of your hair
 
06:13:10.270 --> 06:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
uh subal Massachusetts I think three
 
06:13:13.788 --> 06:13:13.798 align:start position:0%
years ago enacted um an ordinance that
 
06:13:17.750 --> 06:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
said if you have three units one of them
 
06:13:21.230 --> 06:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
if you create three units or you rehab a
 
06:13:24.110 --> 06:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
Triple Decker one of the units has to be
 
06:13:26.030 --> 06:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
permanently affordable and registered at
 
06:13:28.910 --> 06:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
the registry of deeds and all of that
 
06:13:32.510 --> 06:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
and in the intervening 3 years exactly
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
11 units were created but what happened
 
06:13:38.830 --> 06:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
was Somerville the land of the Triple
 
06:13:41.830 --> 06:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
Decker became Somerville the land of the
 
06:13:43.468 --> 06:13:43.478 align:start position:0%
two flat Triple
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
Decker the triple Deckers got turned
 
06:13:49.708 --> 06:13:49.718 align:start position:0%
into two because creating that unit and
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
making it permanently affordable doesn't
 
06:13:57.030 --> 06:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
pencil so instead of making more unit
 
06:13:59.070 --> 06:13:59.080 align:start position:0%
and making them permanently affordable
 
06:14:02.110 --> 06:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
they ended up with fewer units which
 
06:14:04.468 --> 06:14:04.478 align:start position:0%
still weren't affordable so I'd like to
 
06:14:08.110 --> 06:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
not I'd like to see us avoid that very
 
06:14:08.120 --> 06:14:09.110 align:start position:0%
not I'd like to see us avoid that very
well-meaning

06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
well-meaning
 
06:14:12.590 --> 06:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
trap so CAU I have
 
06:14:15.868 --> 06:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
a somewhat support for the bill but I'd
 
06:14:17.548 --> 06:14:17.558 align:start position:0%
like to see a better version thanks so
 
06:14:19.468 --> 06:14:19.478 align:start position:0%
much happy to take
 
06:14:22.230 --> 06:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
questions no one wants to ask I actually
 
06:14:24.390 --> 06:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to ask one so on the second on page
 
06:14:25.430 --> 06:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
two at the end you're talking about
 
06:14:26.990 --> 06:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
section g
 
06:14:28.830 --> 06:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
right you want to say you want to remove
 
06:14:31.430 --> 06:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
that because you believe that that will
 
06:14:34.788 --> 06:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
create more if if a municipality chooses
 
06:14:37.468 --> 06:14:37.478 align:start position:0%
to adopt it it would create it would
 
06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
restrict housing more than it would
 
06:14:40.430 --> 06:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
exactly I mean it's incredibly
 
06:14:42.750 --> 06:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
well-meaning but what we've seen in the
 
06:14:44.310 --> 06:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
real world and Somerville is not the
 
06:14:45.948 --> 06:14:45.958 align:start position:0%
only example of this it's just the one
 
06:14:48.430 --> 06:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
that I know best um we have seen in the
 
06:14:52.070 --> 06:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
real world when that doing that ends up
 
06:14:53.948 --> 06:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
restricting housing rather than creating
 
06:14:55.590 --> 06:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
more housing because it's you know we
 
06:14:57.708 --> 06:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
know the rulle for every dollar that
 
06:14:59.110 --> 06:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to get out and rent you can
 
06:15:02.030 --> 06:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
spend $100 creating that unit if I can
 
06:15:04.468 --> 06:15:04.478 align:start position:0%
only rent that unit for $1,200 and it
 
06:15:08.030 --> 06:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
cost me 24 $240,000 to create it which
 
06:15:11.070 --> 06:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
is not an unusual number I can't build
 
06:15:11.080 --> 06:15:11.830 align:start position:0%
is not an unusual number I can't build
that

06:15:11.830 --> 06:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:15.270 --> 06:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
unit so yeah okay thank you
 
06:15:17.708 --> 06:15:17.718 align:start position:0%
thanks okay thank you very much thank
 
06:15:19.990 --> 06:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
you so much always happy to be
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:25.200 --> 06:15:34.868 align:start position:0%
 
zelic

06:15:34.868 --> 06:15:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
do you mind just turning on the mic for
 
06:15:38.590 --> 06:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
me thank you this good perfect it's a
 
06:15:41.548 --> 06:15:41.558 align:start position:0%
little better yeah so um I live in
 
06:15:44.830 --> 06:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester I'm a trucker local and I
 
06:15:47.468 --> 06:15:47.478 align:start position:0%
decided to come up here uh I'm in favor
 
06:15:49.468 --> 06:15:49.478 align:start position:0%
of this bill to allow
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
duplexes I've lived in New Hampshire for
 
06:15:55.390 --> 06:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
about six years I've lived in Rundown
 
06:15:57.670 --> 06:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
units with I've lived in somewhat nice
 
06:16:00.030 --> 06:16:00.040 align:start position:0%
units I spent some time living in in
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
totally illegal Black Market Housing
 
06:16:04.990 --> 06:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
Development no smoke detectors but it
 
06:16:08.270 --> 06:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
was actually affordable and sunny and
 
06:16:11.270 --> 06:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
nice um just a bit of quick math the
 
06:16:14.150 --> 06:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
median income for working people like me
 
06:16:15.628 --> 06:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
per capita it's like
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
50,000 household it's
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
990,000 the median house price right now
 
06:16:23.468 --> 06:16:23.478 align:start position:0%
is about half a mil so we're looking at
 
06:16:26.788 --> 06:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
3600 bucks a month so for a household
 
06:16:29.590 --> 06:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
making median income it's what like 50%
 
06:16:32.070 --> 06:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
of monthly gross that's not doable and
 
06:16:34.390 --> 06:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
for a single individual you got to have
 
06:16:36.990 --> 06:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
roommates roommates are unstable I've
 
06:16:39.070 --> 06:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
known a lot of people who've left the
 
06:16:42.150 --> 06:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
state um I mean people laugh but you
 
06:16:44.190 --> 06:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
know Virginia and Ohio are quite
 
06:16:46.110 --> 06:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
affordable in comparison you know
 
06:16:48.310 --> 06:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
Indiana too and I know working people
 
06:16:50.110 --> 06:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
like me young
 
06:16:53.788 --> 06:16:53.798 align:start position:0%
professionals that are just leaving um
 
06:16:55.708 --> 06:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
I'd like to be able to stay in the state
 
06:16:58.190 --> 06:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
but increasingly because of the lack of
 
06:17:00.990 --> 06:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and a duplex you take
 
06:17:02.990 --> 06:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
a half a Mill House it doesn't scale any
 
06:17:07.110 --> 06:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
aily you maybe tax on 600 700 to get
 
06:17:10.190 --> 06:17:10.200 align:start position:0%
that duplex 350 you get it down to much
 
06:17:12.948 --> 06:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
closer to 30% of uh median household
 
06:17:14.868 --> 06:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
income it is somewhat affordable for
 
06:17:17.270 --> 06:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
someone like me so duplexes could be the
 
06:17:20.468 --> 06:17:20.478 align:start position:0%
reason that I stay in the state you know
 
06:17:22.510 --> 06:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
um there is Black Market housing that's
 
06:17:24.070 --> 06:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
rising to meet demand but it's not
 
06:17:27.190 --> 06:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
Rising fast enough um it'd be really
 
06:17:30.788 --> 06:17:30.798 align:start position:0%
nice if there's safe legal housing
 
06:17:33.868 --> 06:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
that's permitted to meet demand you know
 
06:17:36.468 --> 06:17:36.478 align:start position:0%
um like I I don't want to have to choose
 
06:17:38.670 --> 06:17:38.680 align:start position:0%
between someplace that's run down or
 
06:17:41.510 --> 06:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
someplace that's black market but not
 
06:17:44.110 --> 06:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
rundown or leaving the state and if you
 
06:17:47.990 --> 06:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
just look at the basic math that duplex
 
06:17:50.310 --> 06:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
it it does put it barely within reach
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know at least if I get a roommate um
 
06:17:55.070 --> 06:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure there's a lot of young
 
06:17:56.868 --> 06:17:56.878 align:start position:0%
people in the state would say the same
 
06:17:58.990 --> 06:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
thing the vast majority of the working
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
class human beings in this state that
 
06:18:02.230 --> 06:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
drive your trucks and take care of your
 
06:18:04.910 --> 06:18:04.920 align:start position:0%
kids and make this state function can't
 
06:18:06.948 --> 06:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
really afford to live here and it's only
 
06:18:08.670 --> 06:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
a matter of time before the housing
 
06:18:11.070 --> 06:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
turnover and the population increase
 
06:18:12.990 --> 06:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
means we have to make a decision
 
06:18:15.670 --> 06:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
duplexes increase the density and
 
06:18:17.590 --> 06:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
because the cost doesn't scale any early
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
you get those economies of scale and it
 
06:18:22.468 --> 06:18:22.478 align:start position:0%
gives us a chance to stay in the state
 
06:18:24.310 --> 06:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
this is a good Bill maybe you could make
 
06:18:26.230 --> 06:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it but it's a really really
 
06:18:28.430 --> 06:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
good bill and it's far better than what
 
06:18:31.030 --> 06:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
we have now thank you thank you for your
 
06:18:32.910 --> 06:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I also have to go serve food
 
06:18:35.430 --> 06:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
and sling beers later so I completely
 
06:18:37.910 --> 06:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand the work in class life yeah
 
06:18:41.628 --> 06:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
something okay um any questions all set
 
06:18:45.390 --> 06:18:45.400 align:start position:0%

06:18:54.840 --> 06:19:02.548 align:start position:0%
 
now

06:19:02.548 --> 06:19:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:05.350 --> 06:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
hello um mix M friedricks from Durham
 
06:19:08.110 --> 06:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire representing 350 uh New
 
06:19:10.350 --> 06:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I just want to clarify to
 
06:19:12.270 --> 06:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
earlier I misspoke on the manufactured
 
06:19:13.948 --> 06:19:13.958 align:start position:0%
housing bill that I was here
 
06:19:15.910 --> 06:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
representing 350 New Hampshire at that
 
06:19:17.788 --> 06:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
time as well been wearing a couple
 
06:19:20.430 --> 06:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
different hats today so I got myself
 
06:19:24.230 --> 06:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
confused um I uh mainly wanted to come
 
06:19:28.110 --> 06:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
forth um with uh oral testimony for this
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
um bill today because uh 350 New
 
06:19:32.830 --> 06:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had raised some concerns about
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
the bill as originally written and had
 
06:19:37.830 --> 06:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
reached out to um the primary sponsor
 
06:19:39.990 --> 06:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the co-sponsors about those and I
 
06:19:42.390 --> 06:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
actually um met with representative Reed
 
06:19:44.590 --> 06:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
and um worked on some of the the parts
 
06:19:48.990 --> 06:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
of the amendment um and so um I think
 
06:19:51.390 --> 06:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
we've already heard a lot of um great
 
06:19:52.990 --> 06:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
reasons to support this bill from the
 
06:19:54.788 --> 06:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
public so mainly I'd like to make myself
 
06:19:56.868 --> 06:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
available for any questions that the
 
06:19:59.070 --> 06:19:59.080 align:start position:0%

members my name is Aaron Kilkenny and
 
06:21:07.150 --> 06:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
I'm from Durham New Hampshire I come
 
06:21:09.788 --> 06:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
before you today not as a policy expert
 
06:21:11.390 --> 06:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
but as a Granite State constituent
 
06:21:15.110 --> 06:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
invested in my community um I support HB
 
06:21:18.910 --> 06:21:18.920 align:start position:0%
1399 and hb1 1291 and humbly ask you to
 
06:21:21.510 --> 06:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on both of these bills I
 
06:21:24.110 --> 06:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
believe housing is a human right I
 
06:21:28.430 --> 06:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
believe that um both uh increasing the
 
06:21:31.910 --> 06:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
um access um for municipalities to um
 
06:21:35.868 --> 06:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
build duplexes um could seriously um
 
06:21:39.430 --> 06:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
tackle our housing crisis um that we
 
06:21:41.868 --> 06:21:41.878 align:start position:0%
face in my town of Durham this could
 
06:21:43.868 --> 06:21:43.878 align:start position:0%
significantly alleviate the pain and
 
06:21:47.788 --> 06:21:47.798 align:start position:0%
suffering I see um in my community um
 
06:21:49.910 --> 06:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
I've dedicated much of my time to this
 
06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
issue I study town planning and land
 
06:21:54.070 --> 06:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
economics at the University of New
 
06:21:56.110 --> 06:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've spent hours is exporing
 
06:21:57.910 --> 06:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
over hundreds of pages of Duram Master
 
06:21:59.590 --> 06:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
plans and meeting minutes from our
 
06:22:02.230 --> 06:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
housing task force also attending public
 
06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
and making public comment at our
 
06:22:05.750 --> 06:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
planning board meetings I'd like to
 
06:22:07.390 --> 06:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
speak to you all today on a part of the
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
housing crisis affecting people like me
 
06:22:11.948 --> 06:22:11.958 align:start position:0%
the most I'm disabled both mentally and
 
06:22:14.230 --> 06:22:14.240 align:start position:0%
physically and my home is so vital to
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%
living with my disabilities although I
 
06:22:18.750 --> 06:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
lie on the low end of needs required to
 
06:22:20.868 --> 06:22:20.878 align:start position:0%
handle my disabilities something some
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
days things change I could be perfectly
 
06:22:24.948 --> 06:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
fine or completely shut down because of
 
06:22:27.150 --> 06:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
noises outside side or muscle pain so
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
bad I am bedridden I can imagine my
 
06:22:31.270 --> 06:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
disabled peers needing a place to rest
 
06:22:33.150 --> 06:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
their bodies and minds but not able to
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
do so because of the rising rents or
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
insanely High grocery bills I see stru
 
06:22:39.510 --> 06:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
such strength within my disability
 
06:22:42.468 --> 06:22:42.478 align:start position:0%
Community but this strength cannot um
 
06:22:44.788 --> 06:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
compensate for a roof over your head um
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
I see all the factors um affecting this
 
06:22:50.110 --> 06:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
crisis I'm sure you would do as well um
 
06:22:52.708 --> 06:22:52.718 align:start position:0%
and we can't wave a magic wand but I
 
06:22:54.390 --> 06:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
believe this is a rare opportunity for
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
granite Staters to have more freedom on
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
their properties when uh constructing
 
06:23:01.990 --> 06:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
duplexes or adus um this New Freedom
 
06:23:04.548 --> 06:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
could in turn create more housing and um
 
06:23:07.548 --> 06:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
help those most vulnerable um again I
 
06:23:11.230 --> 06:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
support both of these um bills um and I
 
06:23:13.830 --> 06:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
am happy to answer any questions thank
 
06:23:15.070 --> 06:23:15.080 align:start position:0%

06:23:47.110 --> 06:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
live in Durham as a student at UNH this
 
06:23:48.590 --> 06:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
is my second year and I'm currently
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
living in an off campus apartment in
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
Durham the housing crisis has impacted
 
06:23:56.468 --> 06:23:56.478 align:start position:0%
all students in UNH Reg ation for campus
 
06:23:58.310 --> 06:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
housing happened in October but many
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
students were left without a guaranteed
 
06:24:02.390 --> 06:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
place to stay and sought off housing off
 
06:24:05.548 --> 06:24:05.558 align:start position:0%
campus excuse me they saw housing off
 
06:24:08.070 --> 06:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
campus housing was largely unavailable
 
06:24:09.628 --> 06:24:09.638 align:start position:0%
and unaffordable in Durham and
 
06:24:11.830 --> 06:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns so many students are
 
06:24:13.350 --> 06:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
worried about displacement for the
 
06:24:16.110 --> 06:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
coming school year currently New
 
06:24:18.708 --> 06:24:18.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is facing a housing crisis the
 
06:24:20.350 --> 06:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
creation of more housing will enable
 
06:24:22.628 --> 06:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
more people to have a safe livable roof
 
06:24:24.468 --> 06:24:24.478 align:start position:0%
over their heads especially in these
 
06:24:26.510 --> 06:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
colder months unhoused people face
 
06:24:29.430 --> 06:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
difficulties and dangers I also support
 
06:24:32.190 --> 06:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
adus as a solution to this problem these
 
06:24:33.750 --> 06:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
Solutions can have the potential to
 
06:24:35.350 --> 06:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
double the amount of available housing
 
06:24:37.548 --> 06:24:37.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire every human deserves
 
06:24:39.230 --> 06:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
the warmth and comfort of a home so I
 
06:24:41.468 --> 06:24:41.478 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote in support of Bill 399
 
06:24:44.110 --> 06:24:44.120 align:start position:0%
and 1291 to make New Hampshire a safer
 
06:24:46.830 --> 06:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
state for all thank you and I am open to
 
06:24:49.548 --> 06:24:49.558 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any
 
06:24:51.948 --> 06:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:24:56.708 --> 06:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
y hi thank you thank you for coming um
 
06:25:01.548 --> 06:25:01.558 align:start position:0%
as a student in Durham um have
 
06:25:05.150 --> 06:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
you felt welcome by the community as far
 
06:25:06.830 --> 06:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
as like
 
06:25:09.788 --> 06:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
um being being a student because I've
 
06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
definitely heard of people um in Durham
 
06:25:14.390 --> 06:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
saying like we don't we don't want more
 
06:25:16.430 --> 06:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
students either living on campus or off-
 
06:25:18.990 --> 06:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
campus or something like that um has it
 
06:25:22.510 --> 06:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
been difficult for you uh you know
 
06:25:24.628 --> 06:25:24.638 align:start position:0%
integrating into that community and and
 
06:25:27.750 --> 06:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
specifically around housing um did did
 
06:25:29.468 --> 06:25:29.478 align:start position:0%
you felt discriminated against because
 
06:25:33.310 --> 06:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
of of being a a resident at Durham or a
 
06:25:36.110 --> 06:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
a student at Durham I guess well I
 
06:25:37.990 --> 06:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily use the word
 
06:25:40.868 --> 06:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
discriminated against but I do know that
 
06:25:43.948 --> 06:25:43.958 align:start position:0%
a lot of Durham residents don't consider
 
06:25:46.310 --> 06:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
students at UNH residents of Durham they
 
06:25:48.510 --> 06:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
consider us students as like a separate
 
06:25:51.030 --> 06:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
population um so in terms of
 
06:25:53.430 --> 06:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
housing um I know that off-campus
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
housing is Extreme unaffordable um
 
06:25:58.510 --> 06:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
because there are a
 
06:26:01.868 --> 06:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
few like organizations like around the
 
06:26:04.670 --> 06:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
Durham campus that charge like really
 
06:26:07.510 --> 06:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
high rent rates because of the campus
 
06:26:10.070 --> 06:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
nearby um and I'm lucky I'm very
 
06:26:11.868 --> 06:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
privileged because my parents help pay
 
06:26:15.868 --> 06:26:15.878 align:start position:0%
with my rent um but the reality is that
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
University Housing is largely the most
 
06:26:21.948 --> 06:26:21.958 align:start position:0%
affordable option and it's extremely
 
06:26:25.590 --> 06:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
expensive so I know that finding housing
 
06:26:33.468 --> 06:26:33.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:36.788 --> 06:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
impossible okay thank you is that it
 
06:26:39.708 --> 06:26:39.718 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you and
 
06:26:41.990 --> 06:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have Nicholas Patrick who has
 
06:26:44.270 --> 06:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony you can give it to
 
06:26:44.280 --> 06:26:50.350 align:start position:0%
written testimony you can give it to
representative

06:26:50.350 --> 06:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:52.830 --> 06:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
Gibbs that's okay if you you can email
 
06:26:54.430 --> 06:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
it as well whatever you prefer to do
 
06:26:58.270 --> 06:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:00.110 --> 06:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
so I'll try to keep this brief as saying
 
06:27:01.830 --> 06:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
as uh my colleagues were saying that we
 
06:27:03.310 --> 06:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
do have a really hard time I would say
 
06:27:04.990 --> 06:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely are discriminated
 
06:27:07.190 --> 06:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
against and Durham uh I'd like to also
 
06:27:08.590 --> 06:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
go I should probably start with my
 
06:27:10.110 --> 06:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
introduction my name is Nicholas Patrick
 
06:27:11.390 --> 06:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm from Dublin New Hampshire and
 
06:27:13.468 --> 06:27:13.478 align:start position:0%
I'm here to support House Bill
 
06:27:16.030 --> 06:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
1399 uh balancing the housing need uh
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
with the state's population is a hard
 
06:27:19.190 --> 06:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
balance with the desire to keep the
 
06:27:20.990 --> 06:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
state's aesthetic and beauty while
 
06:27:23.310 --> 06:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with the population growth uh I
 
06:27:24.750 --> 06:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
think this duplex law would be perfect
 
06:27:27.070 --> 06:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
as it D drastically moves along the
 
06:27:29.150 --> 06:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
vital construction we need it also
 
06:27:31.468 --> 06:27:31.478 align:start position:0%
centers and is built as it sees uh says
 
06:27:34.390 --> 06:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
in Clause one paragraph 1 it uh it's
 
06:27:36.468 --> 06:27:36.478 align:start position:0%
mostly focused on urban areas I think
 
06:27:37.868 --> 06:27:37.878 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea because we already are
 
06:27:39.430 --> 06:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
building there and it's not destroying
 
06:27:41.350 --> 06:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
any of the Aesthetics of New Hampshire
 
06:27:43.310 --> 06:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
nor the community I also think
 
06:27:45.468 --> 06:27:45.478 align:start position:0%
urbanizing a lot of our centers would
 
06:27:47.590 --> 06:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
also allow for easier access to use
 
06:27:50.430 --> 06:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
social services and also create a better
 
06:27:52.350 --> 06:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
Community if as long as there built
 
06:27:54.430 --> 06:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you that's it and I'm
 
06:27:55.468 --> 06:27:55.478 align:start position:0%
happy to answer anything questions you
 
06:27:59.670 --> 06:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
might have represent the thank you thank
 
06:28:02.430 --> 06:28:02.440 align:start position:0%
you for uh coming today
 
06:28:05.990 --> 06:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
um would you say what what type of
 
06:28:08.070 --> 06:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
housing uh would be your preference
 
06:28:09.830 --> 06:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
would you prefer like apartment housing
 
06:28:13.548 --> 06:28:13.558 align:start position:0%
or single family on two acre lots or um
 
06:28:16.030 --> 06:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
what or duplexes what what would be your
 
06:28:18.670 --> 06:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
preference to see more in the state yeah
 
06:28:20.430 --> 06:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I think it all
 
06:28:21.830 --> 06:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
depends I think we really have to look
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
at the Town level and where we're
 
06:28:24.990 --> 06:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
building uh I think when you get more
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
more into the rural areas I think more
 
06:28:28.190 --> 06:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
duplexes and family housing would be
 
06:28:29.750 --> 06:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
best just because that's where you want
 
06:28:31.510 --> 06:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
to move a lot of the families in and
 
06:28:32.628 --> 06:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
raise the kids and make the school
 
06:28:34.110 --> 06:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
districts better and I think when you go
 
06:28:36.390 --> 06:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
to more college towns or more urban
 
06:28:37.948 --> 06:28:37.958 align:start position:0%
areas that we should look a little bit
 
06:28:39.708 --> 06:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
more into single family housing and
 
06:28:41.670 --> 06:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
individual housing just so we can move
 
06:28:44.270 --> 06:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
you know single people as well as people
 
06:28:45.948 --> 06:28:45.958 align:start position:0%
without families or students into the
 
06:28:47.468 --> 06:28:47.478 align:start position:0%
smaller apartments or the studio
 
06:28:49.150 --> 06:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
apartments and then open up the bigger
 
06:28:52.390 --> 06:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
housings for family that's what I would
 
06:28:55.150 --> 06:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
think I I have a question for you so
 
06:28:56.910 --> 06:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
when you say you're discriminated
 
06:28:59.190 --> 06:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
against how do you mean that's a great
 
06:29:01.350 --> 06:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
question and so I'd say probably two or
 
06:29:03.750 --> 06:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
three major things number one uh rent
 
06:29:05.310 --> 06:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
control or not rent control but the rent
 
06:29:06.868 --> 06:29:06.878 align:start position:0%
prices specifically in Durham New
 
06:29:09.430 --> 06:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and although that not is that
 
06:29:11.230 --> 06:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
just because there's an increased demand
 
06:29:13.670 --> 06:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
in that region simp not discrimination
 
06:29:15.948 --> 06:29:15.958 align:start position:0%
right well let me finish um part of it
 
06:29:16.990 --> 06:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
is the
 
06:29:19.708 --> 06:29:19.718 align:start position:0%
$2,300 so the rent's really high right
 
06:29:21.670 --> 06:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the question is the you know we
 
06:29:23.190 --> 06:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
haven't seen an enormous boom in the
 
06:29:25.590 --> 06:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
University's population so how come the
 
06:29:27.430 --> 06:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
rent has skyrocketed I mean it has
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed everywhere but why is it so
 
06:29:31.190 --> 06:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
much higher there even though the
 
06:29:32.910 --> 06:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
population hasn't boomed and I think
 
06:29:34.390 --> 06:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
that's because of the types of housing
 
06:29:35.868 --> 06:29:35.878 align:start position:0%
we're building the housing that we're
 
06:29:37.868 --> 06:29:37.878 align:start position:0%
seeing the units that was being built
 
06:29:40.590 --> 06:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
aren't for you know college students
 
06:29:41.788 --> 06:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
they aren't smaller they aren't
 
06:29:43.150 --> 06:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily studio apartments those
 
06:29:44.910 --> 06:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
exist in Durham New Hampshire but not
 
06:29:46.548 --> 06:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
necessarily what we're building and so
 
06:29:47.948 --> 06:29:47.958 align:start position:0%
they're trying to build a lot of stuff
 
06:29:49.628 --> 06:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
like that and of course I don't have
 
06:29:51.310 --> 06:29:51.320 align:start position:0%
specific quotes but if a lot of the Town
 
06:29:52.708 --> 06:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
Hall minutes you can see kind of the
 
06:29:54.350 --> 06:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
policies they're trying to enact that
 
06:29:55.910 --> 06:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
aren't meant to help students and I
 
06:29:58.590 --> 06:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
think that um we've seen a huge uh
 
06:30:00.110 --> 06:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
culling on the buildings that we're
 
06:30:01.788 --> 06:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
trying to make and I think that that
 
06:30:03.510 --> 06:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
holds a lot of progress towards how much
 
06:30:05.310 --> 06:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
housing is in the area as well as the
 
06:30:07.350 --> 06:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
instability of Roommates versus the
 
06:30:10.190 --> 06:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
stability of a family living in one unit
 
06:30:11.548 --> 06:30:11.558 align:start position:0%
well I appreciate your comments and if
 
06:30:12.670 --> 06:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
you if you feel like you're being
 
06:30:14.948 --> 06:30:14.958 align:start position:0%
discriminated against I urge you to vote
 
06:30:17.628 --> 06:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
in your um local Town elections y um
 
06:30:19.350 --> 06:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
because you have a say as well awesome
 
06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:30:24.430 --> 06:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and thank you for coming
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
in today
 
06:30:28.270 --> 06:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
uh did I understand correctly that one
 
06:30:29.830 --> 06:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the things you would really like to
 
06:30:33.230 --> 06:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
see would be more studio apartments um
 
06:30:36.910 --> 06:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
that would be uh reasonably priced for
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
students and other um single people yeah
 
06:30:42.230 --> 06:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean I'm not 100% sure with
 
06:30:44.388 --> 06:30:44.398 align:start position:0%
like the vocabulary of housing units but
 
06:30:46.468 --> 06:30:46.478 align:start position:0%
like studio apartments smaller ones more
 
06:30:48.628 --> 06:30:48.638 align:start position:0%
for individually like one or two people
 
06:30:50.388 --> 06:30:50.398 align:start position:0%
like you know two bedroom one bedroom
 
06:30:52.310 --> 06:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so yeah something like
 
06:30:55.990 --> 06:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
that recently priced represent every
 
06:30:57.110 --> 06:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for your
 
06:30:59.590 --> 06:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
testimony are you aware that in your
 
06:31:03.150 --> 06:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
town of Durham um in addition to a kind
 
06:31:05.230 --> 06:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
of preference for those more expensive
 
06:31:09.548 --> 06:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
units Durham also uh prohibits unrelated
 
06:31:12.030 --> 06:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
individuals from occupying a bedroom
 
06:31:14.868 --> 06:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
together um which is specifically geared
 
06:31:17.990 --> 06:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
towards preventing students from from in
 
06:31:20.468 --> 06:31:20.478 align:start position:0%
a cost-effective way um room
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
mating yeah uh well I heard about it but
 
06:31:25.070 --> 06:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware until now but but that's
 
06:31:26.270 --> 06:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
really interesting it's definitely
 
06:31:28.070 --> 06:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
something that me and my organization
 
06:31:29.670 --> 06:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
will probably look into and work towards
 
06:31:30.910 --> 06:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:31:34.868 --> 06:31:34.878 align:start position:0%
future represent viell thank you uh
 
06:31:38.868 --> 06:31:38.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for for uh allowing this F
 
06:31:41.310 --> 06:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
this question um you keep on referencing
 
06:31:43.868 --> 06:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
your organization and I'm I'm so there
 
06:31:47.310 --> 06:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
was a uh I'm interested in what is the
 
06:31:50.150 --> 06:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
organization that you're referring to
 
06:31:54.990 --> 06:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
and um if you're aware of a bill in min
 
06:31:56.910 --> 06:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
County government that actually tried to
 
06:32:00.150 --> 06:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
limit the uh discrimination based on uh
 
06:32:03.990 --> 06:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
your familial status uh and that Durham
 
06:32:07.948 --> 06:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
came to testify in opposition to that uh
 
06:32:11.070 --> 06:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
restriction being lifted um because
 
06:32:12.868 --> 06:32:12.878 align:start position:0%
maybe you it sounds like you might be
 
06:32:15.030 --> 06:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
interested in such a bill
 
06:32:18.230 --> 06:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
and uh Durham's position on that yeah
 
06:32:19.310 --> 06:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think uh we would
 
06:32:20.708 --> 06:32:20.718 align:start position:0%
definitely be interested in that type of
 
06:32:22.510 --> 06:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill um specifically the organization
 
06:32:23.830 --> 06:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'm with is the New Hampshire youth
 
06:32:25.468 --> 06:32:25.478 align:start position:0%
movement I just don't don't announce it
 
06:32:26.510 --> 06:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
specifically I don't know how the
 
06:32:28.230 --> 06:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
lobbyist laws work and so I don't want
 
06:32:30.110 --> 06:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
to say who I'm representing I come and
 
06:32:31.430 --> 06:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
represent myself but that is an
 
06:32:33.030 --> 06:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
organization I work with you're
 
06:32:35.670 --> 06:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
affiliated with yes
 
06:32:38.548 --> 06:32:38.558 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for your testimony
 
06:32:53.030 --> 06:32:53.040 align:start position:0%

1399 as well as House Bill
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
1291 New Hampshire is currently
 
06:33:10.310 --> 06:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
experiencing a severe housing crisis
 
06:33:11.670 --> 06:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
many people are having difficulty
 
06:33:13.110 --> 06:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
finding places to live for an affordable
 
06:33:15.350 --> 06:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
price high rent costs and a lack of
 
06:33:17.230 --> 06:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
options are pricing people out of New
 
06:33:19.548 --> 06:33:19.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire new units must be built to
 
06:33:21.708 --> 06:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
keep up with the safe population House
 
06:33:24.190 --> 06:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 1399 will take essential steps and
 
06:33:26.430 --> 06:33:26.440 align:start position:0%
Lessing the housing burden by allowing
 
06:33:27.910 --> 06:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
property owners who build a duplex or
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
maintain an Adu on their property you
 
06:33:31.868 --> 06:33:31.878 align:start position:0%
are giving them another source of income
 
06:33:33.310 --> 06:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
while simultaneously creating a new
 
06:33:35.310 --> 06:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
housing unit as a University of New

06:33:38.868 --> 06:33:38.878 align:start position:0%
have the ability to move on from domator
 
06:33:41.070 --> 06:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
living however the current housing
 
06:33:42.868 --> 06:33:42.878 align:start position:0%
situation poses a significant obstacle
 
06:33:45.388 --> 06:33:45.398 align:start position:0%
to achieving this goal houseful 1399
 
06:33:47.990 --> 06:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
along with houseful 1291 would play a
 
06:33:49.708 --> 06:33:49.718 align:start position:0%
crucial role in improving the chances
 
06:33:51.628 --> 06:33:51.638 align:start position:0%
people like myself to find affordable
 
06:33:53.110 --> 06:33:53.120 align:start position:0%

herrian

06:34:21.310 --> 06:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
herrian
 
06:34:23.590 --> 06:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
welcome uh good afternoon housing
 
06:34:25.628 --> 06:34:25.638 align:start position:0%
committee my name is is Reen harrian I'm
 
06:34:27.830 --> 06:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth New Hampshire and I am
 
06:34:31.350 --> 06:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
here to support house bille uh 1399 and
 
06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
1291 and so my story basically is
 
06:34:36.990 --> 06:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
growing up my parents were living
 
06:34:39.670 --> 06:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
separately and so I was grateful enough
 
06:34:42.708 --> 06:34:42.718 align:start position:0%
to have my mother's house as a safe
 
06:34:45.468 --> 06:34:45.478 align:start position:0%
haven as an escape from my other parent
 
06:34:47.990 --> 06:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
um if it wasn't for her I would have had
 
06:34:50.310 --> 06:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
to be making the decision between
 
06:34:53.350 --> 06:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
staying in an abusive household or
 
06:34:54.948 --> 06:34:54.958 align:start position:0%
risking being homeless
 
06:34:57.070 --> 06:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do not have the
 
06:35:00.190 --> 06:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
privilege and the options that I had in
 
06:35:02.948 --> 06:35:02.958 align:start position:0%
living in New Hampshire if somebody has
 
06:35:05.388 --> 06:35:05.398 align:start position:0%
only one or two parents living together
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
who they do not feel safe in that house
 
06:35:09.868 --> 06:35:09.878 align:start position:0%
and they don't have another place to go
 
06:35:12.548 --> 06:35:12.558 align:start position:0%
because the housing is too expensive and
 
06:35:13.868 --> 06:35:13.878 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
06:35:16.868 --> 06:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
accessible I was simply one person away
 
06:35:20.468 --> 06:35:20.478 align:start position:0%
from a really bad situation many people
 
06:35:22.110 --> 06:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the privilege and options
 
06:35:24.628 --> 06:35:24.638 align:start position:0%
that I had and that's why it is so so
 
06:35:26.548 --> 06:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
important for us to have this affordable
 
06:35:28.868 --> 06:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
and accessible housing in New Hampshire
 
06:35:30.750 --> 06:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
so I again ask that you support House
 
06:35:35.948 --> 06:35:35.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 1399 and House Bill 1291 thank you
 
06:35:37.510 --> 06:35:37.520 align:start position:0%

06:35:39.788 --> 06:35:39.798 align:start position:0%

06:35:45.388 --> 06:35:45.398 align:start position:0%
other U members of the public that like

to testify on HB
 
06:35:50.788 --> 06:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
1399 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
06:35:53.150 --> 06:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on that and um open up
 
06:35:55.670 --> 06:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
our last public hearing of the today is
 
06:35:58.350 --> 06:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
going to be House Bill 1400 and I'll
 
06:36:00.150 --> 06:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
call on representative MC Williams
 
06:36:00.160 --> 06:36:11.468 align:start position:0%
call on representative MC Williams
welcome

06:36:11.468 --> 06:36:11.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
back thank you so much chair Alexander
 
06:36:16.030 --> 06:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
it's my pleasure to be here for the
 
06:36:18.590 --> 06:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
record representative Rebecca McWilliams
 
06:36:21.830 --> 06:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
from South conquered um I'm here to
 
06:36:25.070 --> 06:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 1400 and it is not
 
06:36:27.430 --> 06:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
yet amended but we should probably talk
 
06:36:28.750 --> 06:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
because I've been having some good
 
06:36:30.590 --> 06:36:30.600 align:start position:0%
conversations with the New Hampshire
 
06:36:33.070 --> 06:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and there may be
 
06:36:35.070 --> 06:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
some ways to amend this but let's just
 
06:36:38.110 --> 06:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
talk about the need for this bill um as
 
06:36:40.310 --> 06:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in my previous testimony um
 
06:36:42.708 --> 06:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
I am an architect and I do work in
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
Housing and Development in New Hampshire
 
06:36:47.548 --> 06:36:47.558 align:start position:0%
um and parking has become a really
 
06:36:49.788 --> 06:36:49.798 align:start position:0%
interesting and sort of antiquated
 
06:36:52.670 --> 06:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
concern uh I say this because uh we look
 
06:36:54.350 --> 06:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
at at least here where I live in
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
conquered we look at some of the parking
 
06:36:58.990 --> 06:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
lots for um for large housing
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
developments and even off street parking
 
06:37:04.628 --> 06:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
for small housing uh and there's an
 
06:37:07.948 --> 06:37:07.958 align:start position:0%
awful lot of asphalt often more asphalt
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
than it really looks like there needs to
 
06:37:12.670 --> 06:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
be and that is a direct response to
 
06:37:15.430 --> 06:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
zoning uh which in some instances
 
06:37:18.910 --> 06:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
requires um a parking space sometimes
 
06:37:20.628 --> 06:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
per bedroom although that's not the case
 
06:37:22.868 --> 06:37:22.878 align:start position:0%
in conquer we have ordinances across the
 
06:37:24.548 --> 06:37:24.558 align:start position:0%
state that do occasionally say one
 
06:37:28.110 --> 06:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
parking space per bedroom um or uh in
 
06:37:30.430 --> 06:37:30.440 align:start position:0%
some of the other instances at least two
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
parking spaces per unit uh sometimes
 
06:37:35.350 --> 06:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
more sometimes less uh We've certainly
 
06:37:38.590 --> 06:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
seen that with the adoption of the adus
 
06:37:41.910 --> 06:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh a couple years back some towns have
 
06:37:46.110 --> 06:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
chosen to uh require up to four parking
 
06:37:49.350 --> 06:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
spaces for an Adu in addition to the
 
06:37:51.868 --> 06:37:51.878 align:start position:0%
parking spaces required for the house
 
06:37:54.590 --> 06:37:54.600 align:start position:0%
that hosts the Adu and so when you look
 
06:37:56.830 --> 06:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
at that it becomes a bit prohibitive to
 
06:37:59.190 --> 06:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
expand our housing stock because we have
 
06:38:02.510 --> 06:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
to have this paved asphalt on the lot
 
06:38:05.948 --> 06:38:05.958 align:start position:0%
already because zoning requires it um so
 
06:38:09.868 --> 06:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
in response uh this bill seeks to limit
 
06:38:12.310 --> 06:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
the maximum residential parking spaces
 
06:38:16.350 --> 06:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
allowed per unit to one parking space
 
06:38:18.750 --> 06:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
per unit and so we're sort of raining it
 
06:38:20.350 --> 06:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
back in and saying we have too much
 
06:38:23.230 --> 06:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
asphalt so the average household in New
 
06:38:26.910 --> 06:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 1.5 people and I would say
 
06:38:30.430 --> 06:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
to you that those 1.5 people probably
 
06:38:33.628 --> 06:38:33.638 align:start position:0%
have a car and if they have a second car
 
06:38:36.430 --> 06:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
they could choose to pave a second space
 
06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
in the lot that they own for their
 
06:38:41.510 --> 06:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
second car but they should not be forced
 
06:38:44.230 --> 06:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
by the municipality to have two paved
 
06:38:46.708 --> 06:38:46.718 align:start position:0%
parking spaces if the average is
 
06:38:49.990 --> 06:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
1.5 uh and so there are obviously
 
06:38:51.830 --> 06:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions and this is the whole point
 
06:38:54.628 --> 06:38:54.638 align:start position:0%
of having a code minimum is that owners
 
06:38:57.110 --> 06:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
and developers may increase at their own
 
06:38:59.310 --> 06:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
prerogative but when we start making the
 
06:39:02.590 --> 06:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
code minimum a number that prevents
 
06:39:05.430 --> 06:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
additional uh development within a lot
 
06:39:07.430 --> 06:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
then we're holding ourselves back as a
 
06:39:09.788 --> 06:39:09.798 align:start position:0%
state and we're preventing housing um
 
06:39:13.110 --> 06:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
interesting and fun fact is that a
 
06:39:16.590 --> 06:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
parking space uh dimensionally is 9 ft
 
06:39:19.750 --> 06:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
by 18 ft so if you have two parking
 
06:39:22.590 --> 06:39:22.600 align:start position:0%
spaces together next to each other that
 
06:39:26.388 --> 06:39:26.398 align:start position:0%
is 18 by 36 six that is exactly the size
 
06:39:29.388 --> 06:39:29.398 align:start position:0%
of a studio apartment and so if you are
 
06:39:32.708 --> 06:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
requiring four spaces and you only
 
06:39:37.510 --> 06:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
really need two you could dial it back
 
06:39:39.990 --> 06:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
and require less than four and put in a
 
06:39:42.670 --> 06:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
studio Adu or as we discussed in the
 
06:39:46.388 --> 06:39:46.398 align:start position:0%
previous Bill a uh duplex uh and so I
 
06:39:47.708 --> 06:39:47.718 align:start position:0%
really think that it's important that we
 
06:39:50.230 --> 06:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
as a state look at this uh because
 
06:39:52.910 --> 06:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
obviously zoning is very specific town
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
by town uh but when we require so much
 
06:39:57.910 --> 06:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
asphalt that we cannot move forward with
 
06:40:00.388 --> 06:40:00.398 align:start position:0%
construction additions Renovations
 
06:40:02.948 --> 06:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
duplexes Etc um I think that we're
 
06:40:05.590 --> 06:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
standing in our own way um so with that
 
06:40:07.388 --> 06:40:07.398 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions and as I
 
06:40:09.270 --> 06:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
said there may be an amendment on this
 
06:40:10.590 --> 06:40:10.600 align:start position:0%
because I've been having some good
 
06:40:13.468 --> 06:40:13.478 align:start position:0%
conversations about very large housing
 
06:40:16.430 --> 06:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
developments uh but I'd rather start the
 
06:40:18.670 --> 06:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
discussion where we're at so thank you
 
06:40:19.708 --> 06:40:19.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
06:40:19.718 --> 06:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
representative

06:40:21.590 --> 06:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:40:24.110 --> 06:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you and again thank thank
 
06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
you for being here representative MC
 
06:40:28.510 --> 06:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
Williams and bringing this bill forward
 
06:40:30.868 --> 06:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
um I am somewhat confused by the
 
06:40:33.750 --> 06:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
language of the bill uh the bill uses
 
06:40:36.788 --> 06:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
the term maximum number of parking
 
06:40:38.990 --> 06:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
spaces whereas you've just been
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
referring to minimum and what I what I
 
06:40:46.990 --> 06:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand is did you mean that
 
06:40:52.110 --> 06:40:52.120 align:start position:0%
the uh town uh may not require more than
 
06:40:57.030 --> 06:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
one or may not allow more than one um
 
06:40:59.590 --> 06:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question so
 
06:41:01.548 --> 06:41:01.558 align:start position:0%
this is a requirement you may not
 
06:41:04.230 --> 06:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
require as a municipality more than one
 
06:41:06.670 --> 06:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
parking space per housing
 
06:41:10.350 --> 06:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
unit oh did you mean then uh that the
 
06:41:12.788 --> 06:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
requirement is a minimum number not a
 
06:41:12.798 --> 06:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
requirement is a minimum number not a
maximum

06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
06:41:16.628 --> 06:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
number so I think we could massage the
 
06:41:18.430 --> 06:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
language if you have concerns between
 
06:41:21.110 --> 06:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
the use of the word minimum and maximum
 
06:41:24.388 --> 06:41:24.398 align:start position:0%
but the intent is no more than than one
 
06:41:27.190 --> 06:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
space per unit and however you want to
 
06:41:29.830 --> 06:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
phrase that to be super clear the the
 
06:41:33.110 --> 06:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
words I used were code minimum as in we
 
06:41:36.708 --> 06:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
set the baselines the the the threshold
 
06:41:39.948 --> 06:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
is what we set as the code for the state
 
06:41:42.430 --> 06:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
is the very minimum that you can do as a
 
06:41:44.070 --> 06:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
developer so if you're coming in and
 
06:41:46.350 --> 06:41:46.360 align:start position:0%
you're building a you know six-unit
 
06:41:49.830 --> 06:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
complex the code will require six
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
parking spaces let me let me try and
 
06:41:54.548 --> 06:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
clarify my question a little bit
 
06:41:56.948 --> 06:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
um okay I'm the planning board you're
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
the developer and you want to build a
 
06:42:05.430 --> 06:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
4unit building okay so am I allowed to
 
06:42:08.510 --> 06:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
say to you under this bill I'm only
 
06:42:11.548 --> 06:42:11.558 align:start position:0%
allowed to say to you that you have to
 
06:42:15.388 --> 06:42:15.398 align:start position:0%
have at least one parking space per unit
 
06:42:18.590 --> 06:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
or that you have to have no more than
 
06:42:20.830 --> 06:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
one parking space per unit thank you for
 
06:42:24.150 --> 06:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
the clarification no more than one
 
06:42:26.270 --> 06:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
parking space per unit be required by
 
06:42:28.070 --> 06:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
the planning board I'm sorry I'm I'm
 
06:42:30.990 --> 06:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
still confused
 
06:42:33.750 --> 06:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay suppose you want to so suppose
 
06:42:36.510 --> 06:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
you're the developer and you want to put
 
06:42:38.910 --> 06:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
two parking spaces am I the planning
 
06:42:41.468 --> 06:42:41.478 align:start position:0%
board now have to say to you no you
 
06:42:43.548 --> 06:42:43.558 align:start position:0%
can't put two parking spaces per unit
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
you can only put
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
one uh no thank you for the question I
 
06:42:51.110 --> 06:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear the planning board
 
06:42:51.120 --> 06:42:52.070 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear the planning board
is

06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:42:55.270 --> 06:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
setting you must at least provide four
 
06:42:56.750 --> 06:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
because you have four units and
 
06:42:58.708 --> 06:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
therefore four parking spaces anything
 
06:43:00.990 --> 06:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
you do beyond that is on you it's your
 
06:43:02.788 --> 06:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
decision you could provide eight if you
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to but we need to require four as
 
06:43:06.990 --> 06:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board and the developer
 
06:43:09.350 --> 06:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
will go back and say well you know I may
 
06:43:10.788 --> 06:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
actually think that I want some guest
 
06:43:12.388 --> 06:43:12.398 align:start position:0%
parking and I want to I want to put a
 
06:43:14.590 --> 06:43:14.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more in than what you require
 
06:43:17.110 --> 06:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
but they're not mandated to do
 
06:43:19.070 --> 06:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
additional parking beyond the four that
 
06:43:21.270 --> 06:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
are required one per unit for the four
 
06:43:23.110 --> 06:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
you require more than that but you can't
 
06:43:28.030 --> 06:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:31.910 --> 06:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Damon thank you does
 
06:43:33.868 --> 06:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
it specify somewhere in statute and
 
06:43:35.788 --> 06:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question that
 
06:43:38.270 --> 06:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
the parking spaces need to be paved the
 
06:43:40.750 --> 06:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
asphalt I was not aware of that it does
 
06:43:42.948 --> 06:43:42.958 align:start position:0%
not thank you for the question um and
 
06:43:45.110 --> 06:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
the example I was using is from uh my
 
06:43:46.788 --> 06:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
district in conquered which is very much
 
06:43:49.388 --> 06:43:49.398 align:start position:0%
an urban District but there is no
 
06:43:51.990 --> 06:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for paving at all and as an
 
06:43:54.590 --> 06:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
architect I would not encourage Paving I
 
06:43:56.910 --> 06:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
would say porest pavers is the way to go
 
06:43:58.350 --> 06:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
we have all kinds of runoff issues in
 
06:43:59.830 --> 06:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
this state and we want to preserve our
 
06:44:02.270 --> 06:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
green um areas so thank you for the
 
06:44:02.280 --> 06:44:03.868 align:start position:0%
green um areas so thank you for the
question

06:44:03.868 --> 06:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:44:06.548 --> 06:44:06.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate representative Reed thank you
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
06:44:10.310 --> 06:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
question and and not to go back but I
 
06:44:12.430 --> 06:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
suspect the confusion that was mentioned
 
06:44:15.590 --> 06:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
earlier is a result as is been the case
 
06:44:18.750 --> 06:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
very frequently of an OS Cur per fuffle
 
06:44:22.190 --> 06:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
would you agree that the wording of line
 
06:44:24.070 --> 06:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
five shall should
 
06:44:27.670 --> 06:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
to reach your intent the town shall not
 
06:44:29.670 --> 06:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
set the minimum residential parking
 
06:44:31.510 --> 06:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
spaces per unit to greater than one
 
06:44:33.708 --> 06:44:33.718 align:start position:0%
parking space for residential
 
06:44:36.948 --> 06:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
unit not maximum
 
06:44:39.350 --> 06:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't think I want to go there with
 
06:44:41.388 --> 06:44:41.398 align:start position:0%
the word minimum or maximum at this
 
06:44:43.670 --> 06:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
point I think both of those seem to be
 
06:44:47.110 --> 06:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
absolute I think instead um I I would
 
06:44:50.030 --> 06:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
say that uh the goal here is one
 
06:44:52.548 --> 06:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
residential parking space per unit that
 
06:44:56.708 --> 06:44:56.718 align:start position:0%
the town cannot require more than one so
 
06:44:58.750 --> 06:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
yes I we could say that but minimum and
 
06:45:00.468 --> 06:45:00.478 align:start position:0%
maximum are becoming dangerous so
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
perhaps municipality may not require
 
06:45:04.190 --> 06:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
more than one residential parking space
 
06:45:04.200 --> 06:45:04.990 align:start position:0%
more than one residential parking space
per

06:45:04.990 --> 06:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
per
 
06:45:07.388 --> 06:45:07.398 align:start position:0%
unit I'm going to leave it up to some
 
06:45:08.948 --> 06:45:08.958 align:start position:0%
other smart people to come up with the
 
06:45:10.510 --> 06:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
language and hopefully refer an
 
06:45:11.830 --> 06:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
amendment back to this committee that'
 
06:45:11.840 --> 06:45:12.510 align:start position:0%
amendment back to this committee that'
be

06:45:12.510 --> 06:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:45:15.388 --> 06:45:15.398 align:start position:0%
helpful any other
 
06:45:17.948 --> 06:45:17.958 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much thank
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:22.478 --> 06:45:29.628 align:start position:0%
 
Moore

06:45:29.628 --> 06:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:31.110 --> 06:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chairman members of
 
06:45:33.310 --> 06:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
the committee I know how great it is to
 
06:45:34.788 --> 06:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
be standing between you and a long
 
06:45:38.590 --> 06:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
weekend so I'll be mercifully brief um
 
06:45:40.708 --> 06:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
we support uh by the way Greg Moore Reon
 
06:45:42.468 --> 06:45:42.478 align:start position:0%
director for American for Prosperity we
 
06:45:44.270 --> 06:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
support this legislation we believe it's
 
06:45:46.230 --> 06:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
a it's an important protection once
 
06:45:48.990 --> 06:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
again on individuals property rights but
 
06:45:51.110 --> 06:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
I would say that I would say that
 
06:45:54.190 --> 06:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
legislation like this sort of sort of
 
06:45:55.990 --> 06:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the the whack of mole
 
06:45:58.628 --> 06:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
nature of some of these regulations that
 
06:46:01.590 --> 06:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
that that are popping up and uh at a
 
06:46:03.948 --> 06:46:03.958 align:start position:0%
higher level I think it's important for
 
06:46:06.750 --> 06:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
the work of this committee to continue
 
06:46:09.110 --> 06:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
going forward so we can either address
 
06:46:11.910 --> 06:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
each of these whacka problems or
 
06:46:14.150 --> 06:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
secondarily uh just sort of
 
06:46:16.388 --> 06:46:16.398 align:start position:0%
reconsider what what Authority the state
 
06:46:18.430 --> 06:46:18.440 align:start position:0%
grants to municipalities for Z zoning
 
06:46:21.350 --> 06:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
and planning so I think that that's yes
 
06:46:23.190 --> 06:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
we support this but at a higher level I
 
06:46:25.030 --> 06:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
think think that this is a perfect
 
06:46:27.190 --> 06:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
example of of of the type of work that
 
06:46:28.468 --> 06:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
needs to be done regularly by the
 
06:46:30.110 --> 06:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to update these types of
 
06:46:32.430 --> 06:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
statutes and just basically reconsider
 
06:46:34.350 --> 06:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
the over overall relationship as we are
 
06:46:36.350 --> 06:46:36.360 align:start position:0%
not a home rule state uh the state
 
06:46:38.468 --> 06:46:38.478 align:start position:0%
decides what authorities it grants to
 
06:46:40.030 --> 06:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities in these in these
 
06:46:43.948 --> 06:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
examples and and um every two years you
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
can find more of these probably a dozen
 
06:46:48.708 --> 06:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
more of these and so I just hope you you
 
06:46:50.948 --> 06:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
guys uh keep it up and uh continue down
 
06:46:53.190 --> 06:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
this path I think it's important thank
 
06:46:55.510 --> 06:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony any questions
 
06:46:58.948 --> 06:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Sarah
 
06:47:01.150 --> 06:47:01.160 align:start position:0%
Holland New Hampshire Realtors are they
 
06:47:03.948 --> 06:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
here they probably sent this earlier
 
06:47:03.958 --> 06:47:10.868 align:start position:0%
here they probably sent this earlier
Nick

06:47:10.868 --> 06:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:13.430 --> 06:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman and members
 
06:47:15.628 --> 06:47:15.638 align:start position:0%
of the thank you Mr chairman and members
 
06:47:17.830 --> 06:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
of the committee I'm Nick Taylor the
 
06:47:19.150 --> 06:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
executive director of the workforce
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
Housing Coalition of the greater Sea
 
06:47:22.628 --> 06:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
Coast also want to thank you for this
 
06:47:24.230 --> 06:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
long day and for all your work over the
 
06:47:26.350 --> 06:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
last year tackling this important issue
 
06:47:29.030 --> 06:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're here in support of this bill
 
06:47:31.310 --> 06:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
parking mandates are major housing
 
06:47:33.388 --> 06:47:33.398 align:start position:0%
issues as you know excessive parking
 
06:47:36.110 --> 06:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
mandates increase cost limit housing
 
06:47:38.670 --> 06:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
Supply parking is expensive it can cost
 
06:47:40.310 --> 06:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars if not tens of
 
06:47:42.910 --> 06:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars per spot and those
 
06:47:44.868 --> 06:47:44.878 align:start position:0%
costs get passed right down to renters
 
06:47:47.628 --> 06:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
and to potential buyers um when we talk
 
06:47:50.430 --> 06:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
about affordability of potential housing
 
06:47:51.948 --> 06:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
and developers even with this bill can
 
06:47:53.750 --> 06:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
choose to provide more Park if they
 
06:47:55.270 --> 06:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
believe it's necessary but that should
 
06:47:58.070 --> 06:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
be their call they know their tenants
 
06:48:00.948 --> 06:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
they know the intensity of the use um
 
06:48:02.590 --> 06:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
and parking mandates are particularly
 
06:48:04.350 --> 06:48:04.360 align:start position:0%
impactful for developers of Workforce
 
06:48:06.350 --> 06:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
housing and affordable housing as their
 
06:48:08.910 --> 06:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
tenants often either don't have a car or
 
06:48:11.070 --> 06:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
have one car that they share so anything
 
06:48:13.110 --> 06:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
that starts to you know increase that
 
06:48:14.990 --> 06:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
that mandate there hits them
 
06:48:16.788 --> 06:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
particularly hard in a way that they do
 
06:48:19.150 --> 06:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
not have the bandwidth within their
 
06:48:21.150 --> 06:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
their cost to make it work so again
 
06:48:22.868 --> 06:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
we're here and support this bill and
 
06:48:24.788 --> 06:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
thank you you for today's
 
06:48:27.070 --> 06:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you very
 
06:48:29.350 --> 06:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
much appreciate it thank
 
06:48:49.510 --> 06:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:52.070 --> 06:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
gra thank you Mr chair the last time you
 
06:48:53.948 --> 06:48:53.958 align:start position:0%
have to see me today n gra for the
 
06:48:56.468 --> 06:48:56.478 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um we do oppose
 
06:48:56.478 --> 06:48:57.468 align:start position:0%
municipal Association um we do oppose
this

06:48:57.468 --> 06:48:57.478 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:49:00.670 --> 06:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um but I've handed out um
 
06:49:01.788 --> 06:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
both a copy of the letter that I
 
06:49:04.150 --> 06:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
submitted uh digitally as well as a copy
 
06:49:07.150 --> 06:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
of Section 8 of SP
 
06:49:10.990 --> 06:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
538 um that is also pertaining to
 
06:49:12.830 --> 06:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
parking minimums but in a different
 
06:49:15.230 --> 06:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
manner that is something that if you
 
06:49:18.110 --> 06:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
were to enact as a replace all Amendment
 
06:49:24.110 --> 06:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
we would be okay with um the the
 
06:49:27.990 --> 06:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
difference there is that it would still
 
06:49:30.270 --> 06:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
allow local control and then it would
 
06:49:32.670 --> 06:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
allow some uh setting of parking
 
06:49:34.670 --> 06:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
minimums but it would require the
 
06:49:37.590 --> 06:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
planning board consider any
 
06:49:40.230 --> 06:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
alternative um alternative parking
 
06:49:44.350 --> 06:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
solution proposed by the applicant um so
 
06:49:46.430 --> 06:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
basically any applicant that was coming
 
06:49:48.628 --> 06:49:48.638 align:start position:0%
forward that had was going to build on
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know a street that had adequate
 
06:49:52.110 --> 06:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
street parking or something like that
 
06:49:53.708 --> 06:49:53.718 align:start position:0%
they could say look we don't need to
 
06:49:55.270 --> 06:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
meet the minimum parking requirements
 
06:49:57.990 --> 06:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
because you can park on the street and
 
06:49:59.230 --> 06:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
um that would have to be considered by
 
06:50:01.910 --> 06:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
the planning board um the other thing
 
06:50:04.468 --> 06:50:04.478 align:start position:0%
that I want to point out is that parking
 
06:50:07.708 --> 06:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
policy is very complex um you know I'm
 
06:50:09.430 --> 06:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to work with anyone on
 
06:50:11.590 --> 06:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
on further amendments um and I just want
 
06:50:13.628 --> 06:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
to point out that based on car
 
06:50:16.030 --> 06:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
registrations and population Granite
 
06:50:19.750 --> 06:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
Staters own about one car per person um
 
06:50:21.430 --> 06:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
obviously when we're talking about
 
06:50:23.030 --> 06:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
trying to calculate what is the
 
06:50:26.788 --> 06:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate parking for um for people
 
06:50:31.548 --> 06:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
that's very complex um typically it's a
 
06:50:33.788 --> 06:50:33.798 align:start position:0%
it's a more difficult problem in multif
 
06:50:36.948 --> 06:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
family units than it is single family
 
06:50:40.590 --> 06:50:40.600 align:start position:0%
homes um and ultimately at the end of
 
06:50:42.510 --> 06:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
the day most people except those working
 
06:50:45.788 --> 06:50:45.798 align:start position:0%
at third shift have to park their cars
 
06:50:49.070 --> 06:50:49.080 align:start position:0%
um where they live um so we have to make
 
06:50:50.670 --> 06:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
sure that they have adequate parking
 
06:50:54.350 --> 06:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in the correct Loc
 
06:50:57.750 --> 06:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
so that's why we are able to support um
 
06:51:01.388 --> 06:51:01.398 align:start position:0%
the language in Senate Bill 538 but we
 
06:51:03.670 --> 06:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
can't support the minimum that's
 
06:51:05.590 --> 06:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
proposed in this legislation happy to
 
06:51:07.750 --> 06:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
take any questions the Comm may have
 
06:51:09.388 --> 06:51:09.398 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony
 
06:51:11.910 --> 06:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you for taking
 
06:51:14.590 --> 06:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
my question uh you said that Granite
 
06:51:16.990 --> 06:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
Staters on average own one vehicle per
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
person but I presume you mean per adult
 
06:51:26.910 --> 06:51:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:29.190 --> 06:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
06:51:35.910 --> 06:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:42.270 --> 06:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:44.590 --> 06:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
back we got a special committee this
 
06:51:48.590 --> 06:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
time I know so exciting uh I am in fact
 
06:51:50.388 --> 06:51:50.398 align:start position:0%
iy van from Peter bro New Hampshire and
 
06:51:54.150 --> 06:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
I am here to speak in favor of this bill
 
06:51:56.468 --> 06:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I am speaking in
 
06:51:58.910 --> 06:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
favor of it I you know because I always
 
06:52:00.670 --> 06:52:00.680 align:start position:0%
think things should be way more radical
 
06:52:02.510 --> 06:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
than they are I think we should do away
 
06:52:04.788 --> 06:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
with parking requirements alog together
 
06:52:08.350 --> 06:52:08.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you why uh planners and I
 
06:52:11.910 --> 06:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
am one really we're terrible at figuring
 
06:52:14.868 --> 06:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
out how much parking anything needs we
 
06:52:17.350 --> 06:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
have tables that say things like for
 
06:52:19.868 --> 06:52:19.878 align:start position:0%
every 1273 gallons of water in your
 
06:52:22.190 --> 06:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
Municipal swimming pool you require two
 
06:52:24.070 --> 06:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
parking places and I did not make that
 
06:52:26.468 --> 06:52:26.478 align:start position:0%
up that's an actual Institute of Traffic
 
06:52:29.830 --> 06:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
Engineers statistic but the Institute of
 
06:52:33.788 --> 06:52:33.798 align:start position:0%
Traffic Engineers five years ago said
 
06:52:36.388 --> 06:52:36.398 align:start position:0%
the thing that we all knew was true
 
06:52:40.910 --> 06:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
which is they made up those numbers they
 
06:52:43.830 --> 06:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't know we don't know we should stop
 
06:52:46.910 --> 06:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
pretending we do so that's one reason
 
06:52:49.750 --> 06:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
why I'm at least in favor of reducing it
 
06:52:54.070 --> 06:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
to one the other is financial
 
06:52:57.230 --> 06:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
logistical it costs I just checked these
 
06:53:00.468 --> 06:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
numbers to build one off street parking
 
06:53:04.548 --> 06:53:04.558 align:start position:0%
place with correct substrate paved and
 
06:53:07.070 --> 06:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
of course if you live in Coos County or
 
06:53:08.350 --> 06:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
you know out in the country you don't
 
06:53:10.110 --> 06:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
need to PVE it but if we're talking
 
06:53:13.510 --> 06:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
about a parking place in town we're
 
06:53:14.868 --> 06:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:53:18.910 --> 06:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
$6,500 to build one parking place so if
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
I have to build two for my fourplex for
 
06:53:24.070 --> 06:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
every unit in my
 
06:53:28.270 --> 06:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
fourplex um eight I have to charge each
 
06:53:30.628 --> 06:53:30.638 align:start position:0%
one of those units for those parking
 
06:53:33.628 --> 06:53:33.638 align:start position:0%
places and using back of the de of the
 
06:53:37.190 --> 06:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
envelope developer math that's $130 a
 
06:53:41.628 --> 06:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
month in rent for having created those
 
06:53:44.110 --> 06:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
parking places which maybe we don't even
 
06:53:46.070 --> 06:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
need and here's the other part of my
 
06:53:49.030 --> 06:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
reason for supporting this almost 30% of
 
06:53:50.910 --> 06:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
all households in the United States are
 
06:53:55.670 --> 06:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
one person households one one one um the
 
06:53:57.150 --> 06:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
work that I've been doing with all the
 
06:53:58.910 --> 06:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
little towns all over New Hampshire this
 
06:54:03.190 --> 06:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
year I have yet to work in a town where
 
06:54:06.788 --> 06:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
the average household size is more than
 
06:54:09.910 --> 06:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
2.1 which means that in a lot of those
 
06:54:12.468 --> 06:54:12.478 align:start position:0%
towns more than
 
06:54:15.430 --> 06:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
40% of the households are one person
 
06:54:18.150 --> 06:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
they don't need two parking places
 
06:54:21.230 --> 06:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
parking places cost money they um
 
06:54:23.430 --> 06:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
contribute to Rainwater runoff storm
 
06:54:26.430 --> 06:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
water runoff and if you're building in a
 
06:54:29.590 --> 06:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
place where the planning board has rules
 
06:54:33.070 --> 06:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
about um per impervious coverage and
 
06:54:35.510 --> 06:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
storm water management having to produce
 
06:54:37.548 --> 06:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
all those parking places May kick me
 
06:54:40.548 --> 06:54:40.558 align:start position:0%
over into having to create some kind of
 
06:54:42.948 --> 06:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
complicated and sophisticated and by the
 
06:54:44.430 --> 06:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
way that's code for
 
06:54:46.948 --> 06:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
expensive storm water management system
 
06:54:50.190 --> 06:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
involving vaults and tubes and God only
 
06:54:50.200 --> 06:54:51.590 align:start position:0%
involving vaults and tubes and God only
knows

06:54:51.590 --> 06:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
knows
 
06:54:55.030 --> 06:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
what parking requirements make things
 
06:54:55.040 --> 06:54:55.910 align:start position:0%
what parking requirements make things
more

06:54:55.910 --> 06:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:54:58.788 --> 06:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
expensive they make storm water issues
 
06:55:01.788 --> 06:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
worse they encourage people to
 
06:55:04.788 --> 06:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
drive and they're
 
06:55:08.510 --> 06:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so given all of that well I
 
06:55:10.910 --> 06:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
wish you would say that towns can't
 
06:55:13.468 --> 06:55:13.478 align:start position:0%
require parking minimums at all this is
 
06:55:15.708 --> 06:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction and by the
 
06:55:18.510 --> 06:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
way um in speaking of not requiring
 
06:55:21.590 --> 06:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
parking minimums at all in New Hampshire
 
06:55:23.830 --> 06:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
I think there are
 
06:55:25.948 --> 06:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
I think there are 11 jurisdictions that
 
06:55:28.868 --> 06:55:28.878 align:start position:0%
have done just that and Nationwide there
 
06:55:32.468 --> 06:55:32.478 align:start position:0%
are hundreds if you go and look for
 
06:55:36.230 --> 06:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
parking reform Network you can see a big
 
06:55:38.868 --> 06:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
map of the United States that shows you
 
06:55:40.430 --> 06:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
all the places where they have
 
06:55:43.190 --> 06:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
eliminated parking requirements
 
06:55:46.430 --> 06:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
including Buffalo New York 10 years ago
 
06:55:48.070 --> 06:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
pretty sure the world didn't come to an
 
06:55:50.788 --> 06:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
end and I'm happy to take
 
06:55:52.830 --> 06:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your t
 
06:55:52.840 --> 06:55:54.110 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your t
representative

06:55:54.110 --> 06:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:55:57.270 --> 06:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for uh your
 
06:55:57.280 --> 06:55:59.868 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you for uh your
testimony

06:55:59.868 --> 06:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
um in one of my municipalities they're
 
06:56:06.270 --> 06:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
doing a an invest New Hampshire kind of
 
06:56:09.910 --> 06:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
review of their zoning yeah that's the
 
06:56:11.310 --> 06:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
work that I've been doing for a lot of
 
06:56:12.788 --> 06:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
places but go ahead that's one of the
 
06:56:17.030 --> 06:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
reasons why I'm asking sorry so so um
 
06:56:19.388 --> 06:56:19.398 align:start position:0%
one of the things that they in one of
 
06:56:22.030 --> 06:56:22.040 align:start position:0%
their presentations they mentioned that
 
06:56:24.750 --> 06:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
they looked back
 
06:56:29.230 --> 06:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh I think 20 or something years um and
 
06:56:31.468 --> 06:56:31.478 align:start position:0%
they kind of made the makeup of the
 
06:56:33.628 --> 06:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
municipality as far as how many people
 
06:56:36.510 --> 06:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
were living in each um residence and
 
06:56:38.830 --> 06:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
then they compared that to now and a lot
 
06:56:42.270 --> 06:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
and people have been shifting away from
 
06:56:46.030 --> 06:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
having a multiple people in in houses to
 
06:56:49.510 --> 06:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
one person per houses have you
 
06:56:52.670 --> 06:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
um have you seen that Trend across
 
06:56:55.310 --> 06:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
multiple municipalities and not just the
 
06:56:57.708 --> 06:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
one I happen to attend I have seen that
 
06:57:00.190 --> 06:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
Trend across the United States thank you
 
06:57:01.868 --> 06:57:01.878 align:start position:0%
part of the thing that's driving our
 
06:57:04.468 --> 06:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is the fewer numbers of
 
06:57:07.388 --> 06:57:07.398 align:start position:0%
persons living in each household if you
 
06:57:08.990 --> 06:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
go from having four people in a
 
06:57:10.510 --> 06:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
household or having two people in a
 
06:57:12.430 --> 06:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
household you have to have twice as many
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
houses and we're seeing
 
06:57:21.708 --> 06:57:21.718 align:start position:0%
that oh thank you um and do you do you
 
06:57:22.910 --> 06:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:57:25.910 --> 06:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
that spreading out of instead of having
 
06:57:27.910 --> 06:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
four people to a household only having
 
06:57:31.510 --> 06:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
one person to a household um is a
 
06:57:35.548 --> 06:57:35.558 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the housing demand
 
06:57:37.788 --> 06:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
even though there's not necessarily
 
06:57:41.548 --> 06:57:41.558 align:start position:0%
more people even in my municipality I
 
06:57:43.190 --> 06:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
think they they went up by like three
 
06:57:45.350 --> 06:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
people or something in the last 20 years
 
06:57:47.430 --> 06:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
but we needed a lot more housing for
 
06:57:49.788 --> 06:57:49.798 align:start position:0%
that same number of people absolutely
 
06:57:51.788 --> 06:57:51.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely we we are seeing that
 
06:57:54.590 --> 06:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere and it's particularly true um
 
06:57:58.270 --> 06:57:58.280 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire ages um you have more
 
06:58:01.388 --> 06:58:01.398 align:start position:0%
single single person households but they
 
06:58:03.590 --> 06:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
are still living in the big house
 
06:58:05.910 --> 06:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
because they can't move to a smaller
 
06:58:08.430 --> 06:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
house because there is no smaller house
 
06:58:13.190 --> 06:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
so it's part of the problem in so many
 
06:58:16.310 --> 06:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
ways sorry thank you very much okay
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
great Bryce C
 
06:58:21.990 --> 06:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
Kao thank you for the uh pronunciation
 
06:58:37.990 --> 06:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:40.270 --> 06:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
there all right good afternoon chair
 
06:58:41.548 --> 06:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
Alexander and honorable committee
 
06:58:43.510 --> 06:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
members uh the testimony that I've
 
06:58:47.150 --> 06:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
passed out has testimony 4 hb400 as well
 
06:58:51.270 --> 06:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
as 1291 I'll just speak to 1400 today um
 
06:58:52.708 --> 06:58:52.718 align:start position:0%
but thank you for being here here today
 
06:58:55.510 --> 06:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's been a long one um and so for the
 
06:58:57.430 --> 06:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
record my name is Bryce cwo and for the
 
06:58:59.388 --> 06:58:59.398 align:start position:0%
past four years I've been Ser serving on
 
06:59:00.788 --> 06:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
the Manchester planning board the past
 
06:59:04.510 --> 06:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
two I've been serving as the chair um I
 
06:59:07.190 --> 06:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
am here to provide testimony on hb400 in
 
06:59:09.510 --> 06:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
my own personal capacity though not on
 
06:59:12.430 --> 06:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board so without other way
 
06:59:13.910 --> 06:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
I strongly support
 
06:59:16.750 --> 06:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
hb400 and I urge you all to support it
 
06:59:18.788 --> 06:59:18.798 align:start position:0%
as well the reason why is because as you
 
06:59:20.868 --> 06:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
all know parking minimums are the
 
06:59:22.270 --> 06:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
required number of off street parking
 
06:59:23.708 --> 06:59:23.718 align:start position:0%
spaces that a business or Residential
 
06:59:25.910 --> 06:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
Building must provide as specified in a
 
06:59:28.150 --> 06:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipal zoning code um and while
 
06:59:28.160 --> 06:59:29.750 align:start position:0%
municipal zoning code um and while
well-meaning

06:59:29.750 --> 06:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
well-meaning
 
06:59:32.388 --> 06:59:32.398 align:start position:0%
they have an undeniably detrimental
 
06:59:33.750 --> 06:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
effect on housing Supply and
 
06:59:35.430 --> 06:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
affordability other people have talked
 
06:59:38.190 --> 06:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
to this already um developers are
 
06:59:40.350 --> 06:59:40.360 align:start position:0%
already incentivized to provide enough H
 
06:59:42.350 --> 06:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh parking to meet Market demands
 
06:59:43.910 --> 06:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
whether they're building housing or
 
06:59:45.788 --> 06:59:45.798 align:start position:0%
businesses because if they don't have
 
06:59:45.798 --> 06:59:46.628 align:start position:0%
businesses because if they don't have
enough

06:59:46.628 --> 06:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
enough
 
06:59:48.788 --> 06:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
parking people who they want to sell
 
06:59:50.510 --> 06:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
things to or people who they want to
 
06:59:53.948 --> 06:59:53.958 align:start position:0%
rent to aren't going to want to go there
 
06:59:56.750 --> 06:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
now despite that all across New
 
06:59:58.868 --> 06:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including in Manchester cities
 
07:00:00.628 --> 07:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
and towns are forcing developers to
 
07:00:03.628 --> 07:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
build unwanted extra parking spaces if
 
07:00:05.310 --> 07:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
this parking was free and could go under
 
07:00:06.788 --> 07:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
ground at no cost then that would be
 
07:00:06.798 --> 07:00:07.830 align:start position:0%
ground at no cost then that would be
fine

07:00:07.830 --> 07:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
fine
 
07:00:10.788 --> 07:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
but we are Paving over Paradise at a
 
07:00:14.030 --> 07:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
terrible cost iivan mentioned it um as
 
07:00:16.230 --> 07:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
well each unnecessary parking space can
 
07:00:18.270 --> 07:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
take thousands if not tens of thousands
 
07:00:19.788 --> 07:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
of dollars to create depending on
 
07:00:22.670 --> 07:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
whether it is just Standalone or on in a
 
07:00:24.510 --> 07:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
structure like a parking garage or
 
07:00:27.430 --> 07:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
underground um and each dollar that is
 
07:00:31.190 --> 07:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
spent on unnecessary parking is a dollar
 
07:00:33.510 --> 07:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
that is going to be recouped in the form
 
07:00:36.190 --> 07:00:36.200 align:start position:0%
of rent or in the form of sales prices
 
07:00:38.310 --> 07:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
so the bill before you um is pretty
 
07:00:40.070 --> 07:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
simple straightforward and targeted I
 
07:00:41.628 --> 07:00:41.638 align:start position:0%
agree that the language could be refined
 
07:00:44.310 --> 07:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
so that it is a bit clearer um but that
 
07:00:46.868 --> 07:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
being said the question in front of this
 
07:00:48.110 --> 07:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
committee and in front of the state
 
07:00:49.590 --> 07:00:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislator is should the state of New
 
07:00:52.708 --> 07:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire allow cities and towns
 
07:00:55.030 --> 07:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
to have the authority to mandate more
 
07:00:57.070 --> 07:00:57.080 align:start position:0%
than one parking space per housing unit
 
07:00:59.468 --> 07:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
and I think not because we are in a
 
07:01:01.190 --> 07:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
housing crisis we should act accordingly
 
07:01:03.270 --> 07:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
we should be trying to remove barriers
 
07:01:06.230 --> 07:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
to housing as we encounter them um and
 
07:01:08.750 --> 07:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
cities across the country are reducing
 
07:01:10.670 --> 07:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
or eliminating these minimums and I
 
07:01:12.708 --> 07:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire should be next um
 
07:01:14.150 --> 07:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is just bringing it down to one
 
07:01:18.270 --> 07:01:18.280 align:start position:0%
space being required but um in the end
 
07:01:19.990 --> 07:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
providing storage space for cars should
 
07:01:22.190 --> 07:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
never take priority in my opinion over
 
07:01:24.708 --> 07:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
providing housing for people and so in
 
07:01:26.468 --> 07:01:26.478 align:start position:0%
an effort to improve housing Supply and
 
07:01:27.990 --> 07:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
affordability across the entire State I
 
07:01:29.708 --> 07:01:29.718 align:start position:0%
respectfully encourage this committee to
 
07:01:31.110 --> 07:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
support uh
 
07:01:33.548 --> 07:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
hp400 um I do have one more thing real
 
07:01:35.190 --> 07:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
quick uh just in case we don't get to it
 
07:01:38.190 --> 07:01:38.200 align:start position:0%
in a question but some people might
 
07:01:39.628 --> 07:01:39.638 align:start position:0%
wonder why should the state get involved
 
07:01:41.628 --> 07:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
here this is pretty much a local thing
 
07:01:43.708 --> 07:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
people might want local control and my
 
07:01:46.788 --> 07:01:46.798 align:start position:0%
simplest and most honest answer here is
 
07:01:48.110 --> 07:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
if we could actually rely on
 
07:01:49.708 --> 07:01:49.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do this on their own
 
07:01:51.230 --> 07:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
and to fix this on their own they would
 
07:01:53.190 --> 07:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
have already we wouldn't be talking here
 
07:01:55.750 --> 07:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
today about this issue um same goes for
 
07:01:57.310 --> 07:01:57.320 align:start position:0%
many of the other housing bills but
 
07:02:00.030 --> 07:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
State action is being sought because
 
07:02:02.750 --> 07:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
town and City governments have not met
 
07:02:04.868 --> 07:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
this moment so with that thank you for
 
07:02:06.230 --> 07:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
your time be happy to answer any
 
07:02:07.468 --> 07:02:07.478 align:start position:0%
questions but I know it's been a long
 
07:02:09.670 --> 07:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
day thank you for your
 
07:02:11.670 --> 07:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it thank you thank
 
07:02:20.510 --> 07:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:22.910 --> 07:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
schwier I'm Mr Bill Roy schwager from
 
07:02:24.788 --> 07:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
conquer thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:02:26.030 --> 07:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
07:02:28.670 --> 07:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee what I haven't heard yet is
 
07:02:30.628 --> 07:02:30.638 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an idea that we should
 
07:02:34.350 --> 07:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh have less dependence on cars and more
 
07:02:36.670 --> 07:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
on walking and public transportation and
 
07:02:39.190 --> 07:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
so forth and if that's the case this
 
07:02:42.230 --> 07:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill goes exactly the wrong way I
 
07:02:43.590 --> 07:02:43.600 align:start position:0%
remember when conquer didn't allow
 
07:02:45.750 --> 07:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
overnight parking on streets and that
 
07:02:47.190 --> 07:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
meant they didn't plow the snow up on
 
07:02:49.310 --> 07:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
the sidewalks so people would shovel the
 
07:02:50.990 --> 07:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalks you could actually walk on
 
07:02:51.000 --> 07:02:52.628 align:start position:0%
sidewalks you could actually walk on
sidewalks

07:02:52.628 --> 07:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
sidewalks
 
07:02:56.230 --> 07:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
and I remember when uh you know people
 
07:02:58.590 --> 07:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
would actually do that but now because
 
07:03:01.310 --> 07:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
they're trying to you know provide
 
07:03:04.030 --> 07:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
parking the sidewalks R full of snow no
 
07:03:05.788 --> 07:03:05.798 align:start position:0%
one wants to shovel snow from the whole
 
07:03:07.910 --> 07:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
street off the sidewalk so now the
 
07:03:11.510 --> 07:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
people have to walk in the street and if
 
07:03:13.708 --> 07:03:13.718 align:start position:0%
you really want to encourage you know
 
07:03:16.070 --> 07:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
alternative uses you need to make the
 
07:03:17.708 --> 07:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
developers provide the parking in their
 
07:03:20.468 --> 07:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
own Lots so the city can take back their
 
07:03:22.990 --> 07:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
streets and their side walks for people
 
07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
to actually
 
07:03:24.000 --> 07:03:25.628 align:start position:0%
to actually
use

07:03:25.628 --> 07:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
use
 
07:03:28.548 --> 07:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
and I I live in North conquer which is
 
07:03:30.628 --> 07:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
different from represen MC Williams
 
07:03:33.590 --> 07:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
apparently I have issues and I'll email
 
07:03:35.628 --> 07:03:35.638 align:start position:0%
you folks a photo that people are
 
07:03:37.590 --> 07:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
parking overnight on the sidewalk
 
07:03:39.230 --> 07:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
because they don't have enough parking
 
07:03:40.868 --> 07:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
in the photo I'm going to show you there
 
07:03:43.270 --> 07:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
are two duplexes Each of which has five
 
07:03:45.388 --> 07:03:45.398 align:start position:0%
parking spaces and each of them still
 
07:03:47.548 --> 07:03:47.558 align:start position:0%
has a vehicle parked on the street
 
07:03:50.030 --> 07:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
because people own more cars than you
 
07:03:52.750 --> 07:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
think we have a lot of work housing well
 
07:03:54.270 --> 07:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
in my neighborhood Workforce housing
 
07:03:55.990 --> 07:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
means somebody may be a plumber and
 
07:03:57.910 --> 07:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
electrician so in addition to their own
 
07:04:00.270 --> 07:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
car they've got this monster van with
 
07:04:01.670 --> 07:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
stuff they've got to find someplace to
 
07:04:03.868 --> 07:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
park so there's yet one more thing that
 
07:04:05.388 --> 07:04:05.398 align:start position:0%
parked on the street it's even too big
 
07:04:07.388 --> 07:04:07.398 align:start position:0%
for a parking space but you know they
 
07:04:09.708 --> 07:04:09.718 align:start position:0%
park it on the street and they try and
 
07:04:11.948 --> 07:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
cure that problem downtown by having a
 
07:04:14.150 --> 07:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
parking garage but people won't pay to
 
07:04:16.388 --> 07:04:16.398 align:start position:0%
park in the garage unless they subsidize
 
07:04:18.590 --> 07:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
it so we're making everyone's housing in
 
07:04:21.270 --> 07:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
the city more expensive by requiring
 
07:04:24.628 --> 07:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
people to to uh you know subsidize the
 
07:04:27.030 --> 07:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
parking for the developers that don't
 
07:04:30.270 --> 07:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
provide it so I think we need to have a
 
07:04:32.590 --> 07:04:32.600 align:start position:0%
situation where the developer is
 
07:04:34.350 --> 07:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
required to provide a reasonable amount
 
07:04:36.628 --> 07:04:36.638 align:start position:0%
of parking that's is probably based not
 
07:04:39.030 --> 07:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
on the number of units but perhaps on
 
07:04:40.190 --> 07:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
07:04:43.030 --> 07:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
bedrooms I can explain that there's this
 
07:04:44.548 --> 07:04:44.558 align:start position:0%
one duplex I know of it had three
 
07:04:47.430 --> 07:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
bedrooms on each side originally one
 
07:04:49.030 --> 07:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
person lived on one side and rented out
 
07:04:51.110 --> 07:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
one room and the other side had two
 
07:04:53.070 --> 07:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
adults and two kids so they had four
 
07:04:56.230 --> 07:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
cars already that's as many as the lot
 
07:04:58.230 --> 07:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
can hold well guess what when the taxes
 
07:05:00.110 --> 07:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
went up the person decided to run out
 
07:05:01.830 --> 07:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
both bedrooms so there's now three cars
 
07:05:04.350 --> 07:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
on that side plus the teenager it's not
 
07:05:06.548 --> 07:05:06.558 align:start position:0%
just adults that have cars the teenager
 
07:05:08.150 --> 07:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
got a car on the other side so now we
 
07:05:11.030 --> 07:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
have six cars in this duplex and you're
 
07:05:13.468 --> 07:05:13.478 align:start position:0%
saying oh one's enough well I think
 
07:05:14.830 --> 07:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
that's not right I think we should allow
 
07:05:17.070 --> 07:05:17.080 align:start position:0%
the communities to determine how many
 
07:05:19.110 --> 07:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
parking spaces we need if it's downtown
 
07:05:20.868 --> 07:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
you have parking garages that may be
 
07:05:23.868 --> 07:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
zero but it's further out it may mean
 
07:05:26.190 --> 07:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
one per bedroom or something like that
 
07:05:28.030 --> 07:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
once again represent M Williams talks
 
07:05:30.110 --> 07:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
about a quarter acre lot I've got an
 
07:05:31.150 --> 07:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
eighth of an acre and some of my
 
07:05:33.070 --> 07:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors have a 16th of an acre you
 
07:05:34.628 --> 07:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
know why are we trying to cram more
 
07:05:37.110 --> 07:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
people onto those there's better places
 
07:05:38.830 --> 07:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
to put them so I'm going to call this
 
07:05:42.190 --> 07:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
bill your choice of the developers uh
 
07:05:45.430 --> 07:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
Delight or the slum Lord's Delight Andor
 
07:05:46.830 --> 07:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
hate your neighbor bill because you're
 
07:05:48.110 --> 07:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
going to park on the street all the time
 
07:05:50.030 --> 07:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
and take up the space thank
 
07:05:52.948 --> 07:05:52.958 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your time
 
07:05:55.628 --> 07:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
07:06:07.468 --> 07:06:07.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:10.230 --> 07:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
Kramer hello
 
07:06:12.990 --> 07:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
again Ben Kramer I live in New Market
 
07:06:14.190 --> 07:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
organizing director at New Hampshire
 
07:06:16.030 --> 07:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
youth movement um still here to
 
07:06:18.350 --> 07:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
represent young people and my
 
07:06:21.670 --> 07:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
organization um I have two copies of of
 
07:06:22.948 --> 07:06:22.958 align:start position:0%
my full testimony I'll give you the
 
07:06:25.868 --> 07:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
Abridged version um we support this bill
 
07:06:28.750 --> 07:06:28.760 align:start position:0%
I think because it directly
 
07:06:31.270 --> 07:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
addresses the link between the cost of
 
07:06:33.548 --> 07:06:33.558 align:start position:0%
building parking and the cost of housing
 
07:06:35.270 --> 07:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
like so many others have said that cost
 
07:06:38.030 --> 07:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
is passed on to occupants and especially
 
07:06:41.510 --> 07:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
to renters and we have a major rent
 
07:06:44.070 --> 07:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
problem in this state
 
07:06:46.310 --> 07:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah we should do away with parking
 
07:06:48.750 --> 07:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
minimums to let the people who know the
 
07:06:51.070 --> 07:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
projects best decide how much parking is
 
07:06:52.270 --> 07:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
truly needed
 
07:06:53.788 --> 07:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
and cut the red tape between us and
 
07:06:55.430 --> 07:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
building the housing we need to solve
 
07:06:55.440 --> 07:06:56.548 align:start position:0%
building the housing we need to solve
the

07:06:56.548 --> 07:06:56.558 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:06:58.868 --> 07:06:58.878 align:start position:0%
shortage we support this bill I'll leave
 
07:07:00.910 --> 07:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
it at that um I also want to say like I
 
07:07:02.670 --> 07:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
genuinely appreciate the work that this
 
07:07:04.190 --> 07:07:04.200 align:start position:0%
committee has done and like taking this
 
07:07:06.948 --> 07:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
long day we have a major housing crisis
 
07:07:08.948 --> 07:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
in the states and we need solutions that
 
07:07:11.070 --> 07:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
rise to the scale of Crisis and I
 
07:07:12.270 --> 07:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the hard work that has
 
07:07:13.590 --> 07:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
gone into this and the good faith

collaboration that has gone into this
 
07:07:17.628 --> 07:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
and the bills being heard today are an
 
07:07:19.030 --> 07:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
excellent starting place and a
 
07:07:20.750 --> 07:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
foundation that we need to build on to
 
07:07:23.270 --> 07:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually continue to rise to the scale
 
07:07:25.788 --> 07:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
of the crisis um and and address what we
 
07:07:28.070 --> 07:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
really need in the state so thank you
 
07:07:28.080 --> 07:07:28.948 align:start position:0%

organization dedicated to uh empowering
 
07:08:04.910 --> 07:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
educating and activating young people in
 
07:08:07.510 --> 07:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
our state today I'm here to testify in
 
07:08:09.230 --> 07:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
07:08:12.388 --> 07:08:12.398 align:start position:0%
1400 um you know parking requirements
 
07:08:15.430 --> 07:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
play an important role in how many homes
 
07:08:18.708 --> 07:08:18.718 align:start position:0%
are able to be developed in several ways
 
07:08:20.628 --> 07:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
um the added cost of parking to
 
07:08:23.030 --> 07:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
development whether there's enough land
 
07:08:25.868 --> 07:08:25.878 align:start position:0%
to support the required parking and the
 
07:08:28.270 --> 07:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
overall impact on affordability are just
 
07:08:30.468 --> 07:08:30.478 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
07:08:34.430 --> 07:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
um parking requirements are most often
 
07:08:36.590 --> 07:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
minimums that are set either per
 
07:08:39.070 --> 07:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
apartment or per bedroom meaning that
 
07:08:42.030 --> 07:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
for a development to be built there must
 
07:08:45.070 --> 07:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
be a certain number of parking spaces
 
07:08:48.030 --> 07:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
and uh these rules do not allow for
 
07:08:50.590 --> 07:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
assessing the needs of future residents
 
07:08:53.468 --> 07:08:53.478 align:start position:0%
in the building but instead apply a one
 
07:08:56.468 --> 07:08:56.478 align:start position:0%
siiz fits all rule regardless of whether
 
07:08:58.868 --> 07:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
or not for example the unit is on a bus
 
07:09:02.030 --> 07:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
line is going to be a home to seniors or
 
07:09:05.190 --> 07:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
is for working people with cars um also
 
07:09:07.910 --> 07:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
as you heard parking is incredibly
 
07:09:10.388 --> 07:09:10.398 align:start position:0%
expensive so developers often have to
 
07:09:12.670 --> 07:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
charge a higher price in order to cover
 
07:09:15.910 --> 07:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of building that is required of
 
07:09:19.548 --> 07:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
them um these reasons are and more that
 
07:09:21.468 --> 07:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
you've heard today um but mostly the
 
07:09:23.310 --> 07:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
concerns on affordability on tenants are
 
07:09:25.910 --> 07:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
some reasons why uh we encourage you to
 
07:09:28.708 --> 07:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh support this bill and consider uh
 
07:09:30.350 --> 07:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
reconsider parking requirements in New
 
07:09:32.750 --> 07:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um thank you so much for
 
07:09:35.350 --> 07:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
your time and this long day and I'll see
 
07:09:36.868 --> 07:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
you at some hearings in the future after
 
07:09:39.510 --> 07:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
February break I guess wonderful thank
 
07:09:40.868 --> 07:09:40.878 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony representative
 
07:09:42.510 --> 07:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
Vella has a question for you if that's
 
07:09:42.520 --> 07:09:44.430 align:start position:0%
Vella has a question for you if that's
okay

07:09:44.430 --> 07:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:09:47.910 --> 07:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah certainly thank you thank you for
 
07:09:54.190 --> 07:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
for coming um do have you uh found that
 
07:09:57.350 --> 07:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
um the young people that you deal with
 
07:10:00.830 --> 07:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
are taking advantage of more options as
 
07:10:03.868 --> 07:10:03.878 align:start position:0%
far as like electric bikes and maybe one
 
07:10:07.708 --> 07:10:07.718 align:start position:0%
wheels and stuff like that that may be
 
07:10:10.590 --> 07:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
able to transport them a farther
 
07:10:12.388 --> 07:10:12.398 align:start position:0%
distance without actually the
 
07:10:14.270 --> 07:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance cost and the size
 
07:10:18.430 --> 07:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
requirements of that uh a false parking
 
07:10:21.868 --> 07:10:21.878 align:start position:0%
space and may um you know a Avail
 
07:10:25.388 --> 07:10:25.398 align:start position:0%
themselves of that type of uh technology
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
in recent years so that the reduced need
 
07:10:36.110 --> 07:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
for these parking spaces is um is occurs
 
07:10:38.670 --> 07:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
in in that population yeah certainly I
 
07:10:41.110 --> 07:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
think you know a a desire of a lot of
 
07:10:42.270 --> 07:10:42.280 align:start position:0%
young folks is to live in like a
 
07:10:43.670 --> 07:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
walkable downtown where you can get
 
07:10:45.468 --> 07:10:45.478 align:start position:0%
there really easily but even just
 
07:10:47.270 --> 07:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
speaking from my personal experience I
 
07:10:48.830 --> 07:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
have a bike I live you know not the
 
07:10:50.628 --> 07:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
closest to downtown but I think it's a
 
07:10:53.230 --> 07:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
great way to get um I often take my bike
 
07:10:54.750 --> 07:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
downtown I have to ride some errands I
 
07:10:56.150 --> 07:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
have a lot of friends who have like you
 
07:10:59.190 --> 07:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
said ebikes or scooters those like weird
 
07:11:01.070 --> 07:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
onewheel things I think certainly it's a
 
07:11:02.788 --> 07:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
desire of young folks to not have to
 
07:11:05.110 --> 07:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
rely on a traditional vehicle for
 
07:11:07.788 --> 07:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
transportation and um be able to get do
 
07:11:09.070 --> 07:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
things other
 
07:11:12.750 --> 07:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
ways yeah thank you for your testimony
 
07:11:15.270 --> 07:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you have a good day you as well
 
07:11:15.280 --> 07:11:16.548 align:start position:0%
thank you have a good day you as well
Nicholas

07:11:16.548 --> 07:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
Nicholas
 
07:11:19.150 --> 07:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
Patrick is he still
 
07:11:31.350 --> 07:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:33.788 --> 07:11:33.798 align:start position:0%
hey uh good afternoon thank you for
 
07:11:36.070 --> 07:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony um it's been a long
 
07:11:39.310 --> 07:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
day appreciate your patience um I live
 
07:11:42.708 --> 07:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
in Manchester uh Ward one and I work
 
07:11:44.230 --> 07:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
with a group called Manchester housing
 
07:11:46.628 --> 07:11:46.638 align:start position:0%
Alliance welcome back yeah thank you and
 
07:11:50.190 --> 07:11:50.200 align:start position:0%
we uh attempt to make uh incentives for
 
07:11:52.910 --> 07:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
people to build more affordable housing
 
07:11:55.310 --> 07:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that I would agree with Ivy
 
07:11:56.868 --> 07:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
van who says we should just get rid of
 
07:11:59.548 --> 07:11:59.558 align:start position:0%
parking minimums altogether and not
 
07:12:01.910 --> 07:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
allow municipalities to create parking
 
07:12:03.750 --> 07:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
minimums and I think it's up to
 
07:12:07.750 --> 07:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
developers because as um Bryce said uh
 
07:12:10.468 --> 07:12:10.478 align:start position:0%
you know developers have an incentive to
 
07:12:13.030 --> 07:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
create a project that people are going
 
07:12:14.670 --> 07:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
to want to rent and if they think they
 
07:12:16.948 --> 07:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
can rent it with four parking spaces or
 
07:12:20.310 --> 07:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
eight parking spaces I mean so much for
 
07:12:23.510 --> 07:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
that um but when we require them to
 
07:12:25.868 --> 07:12:25.878 align:start position:0%
create parking spaces I don't know if
 
07:12:27.830 --> 07:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
you've ever been to one of Ivy Vans uh
 
07:12:30.708 --> 07:12:30.718 align:start position:0%
little workshops on zoning but if you
 
07:12:33.110 --> 07:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
require parking spaces and there's a
 
07:12:36.110 --> 07:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
maximum amount of lot coverage then
 
07:12:39.030 --> 07:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're making uh requiring the building
 
07:12:41.310 --> 07:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
that they build to be particularly small
 
07:12:42.910 --> 07:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
or smaller than it would be so you're
 
07:12:42.920 --> 07:12:44.030 align:start position:0%
or smaller than it would be so you're
actually

07:12:44.030 --> 07:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:12:46.510 --> 07:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
eliminating um you know maybe three or
 
07:12:48.948 --> 07:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
four housing units just for the sake of
 
07:12:51.750 --> 07:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
having extra parking for everybody
 
07:12:54.548 --> 07:12:54.558 align:start position:0%
and um we've seen developers in uh
 
07:12:57.150 --> 07:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester be creative about this and
 
07:12:59.510 --> 07:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
maybe buy a cheaper lot you know down
 
07:13:00.868 --> 07:13:00.878 align:start position:0%
the street or something for their
 
07:13:02.430 --> 07:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
tenants to park if they think that's
 
07:13:04.670 --> 07:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
going to be an incentive there's also
 
07:13:06.468 --> 07:13:06.478 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for tenants in a
 
07:13:08.910 --> 07:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
particular building to rent a parking
 
07:13:12.310 --> 07:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
space if they need one but when we
 
07:13:14.590 --> 07:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
require the developer to have say eight
 
07:13:16.548 --> 07:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
parking spaces then everybody in the
 
07:13:19.190 --> 07:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
building is basically paying that extra
 
07:13:21.430 --> 07:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
rent whether they happen to need a
 
07:13:25.070 --> 07:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
parking space or not and um so I think
 
07:13:27.990 --> 07:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
it reduces the number of units that
 
07:13:32.708 --> 07:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
we're able to build and um and you know
 
07:13:34.708 --> 07:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
in addition to all the other things that
 
07:13:37.868 --> 07:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
iy van and Bryce said about lot coverage
 
07:13:41.388 --> 07:13:41.398 align:start position:0%
and impermeable surfaces and cost of
 
07:13:44.670 --> 07:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
parking lots etc etc etc so I'll just
 
07:13:47.548 --> 07:13:47.558 align:start position:0%
end it there unless anybody has any
 
07:13:49.910 --> 07:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
07:13:51.468 --> 07:13:51.478 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:13:54.948 --> 07:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Jeremy
 
07:13:57.270 --> 07:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
Olsen I have one more pink card so if
 
07:13:59.230 --> 07:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else wishes to testify please
 
07:14:04.030 --> 07:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:06.110 --> 07:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon members of the
 
07:14:08.110 --> 07:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
committee I hadn't planned on testifying
 
07:14:09.788 --> 07:14:09.798 align:start position:0%
on this bill but I heard some stuff I
 
07:14:13.070 --> 07:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um web basically I look
 
07:14:14.510 --> 07:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
at this I'm absolutely in support of
 
07:14:17.070 --> 07:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
this bill and I look at this as it's
 
07:14:19.150 --> 07:14:19.160 align:start position:0%
both about property rights for the owner
 
07:14:21.110 --> 07:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
and the developer of the property and I
 
07:14:23.430 --> 07:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
also see this as this because this is
 
07:14:25.310 --> 07:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
basically a bipartisan bill because like
 
07:14:26.708 --> 07:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
conservatives and Libertarians should
 
07:14:28.948 --> 07:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
support this as a basic private property
 
07:14:30.948 --> 07:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
rights thing and Progressive support it
 
07:14:32.590 --> 07:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
because it's helping us move away from
 
07:14:35.230 --> 07:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
like such a car-based society if people
 
07:14:36.990 --> 07:14:37.000 align:start position:0%
living in areas where you have people
 
07:14:39.388 --> 07:14:39.398 align:start position:0%
parking cars illegally on the sidewalk
 
07:14:40.548 --> 07:14:40.558 align:start position:0%
parking cars where they're not supposed
 
07:14:42.788 --> 07:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
to be on the road that shouldn't be a
 
07:14:46.310 --> 07:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
problem for the city to then impose
 
07:14:48.788 --> 07:14:48.798 align:start position:0%
something on the property owner to do
 
07:14:50.070 --> 07:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
something about it people are parking on
 
07:14:52.948 --> 07:14:52.958 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk ticket the car tell the car
 
07:14:54.430 --> 07:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
don't tell the property owner they have
 
07:14:56.548 --> 07:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
to build a parking spot for that
 
07:15:00.110 --> 07:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
secondly I own a rental property I tell
 
07:15:01.948 --> 07:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
my tenants that they can or cannot have
 
07:15:03.990 --> 07:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
cars if I did not have a parking lot on
 
07:15:05.548 --> 07:15:05.558 align:start position:0%
my property I'd tell them they can't
 
07:15:06.708 --> 07:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
have a car on the property they're not
 
07:15:07.708 --> 07:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
going to be able to park it on the
 
07:15:09.830 --> 07:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalk or something in front of it so
 
07:15:11.670 --> 07:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
um again I'm I'm entirely in support of
 
07:15:14.190 --> 07:15:14.200 align:start position:0%
this bill it's a private property rights
 
07:15:15.628 --> 07:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
thing and I think it's a good bill to
 
07:15:17.430 --> 07:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
get rid of the parking minimums that
 
07:15:19.670 --> 07:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
they currently have in many cities be
 
07:15:21.388 --> 07:15:21.398 align:start position:0%
Happ to take any questions thank you for
 
07:15:23.350 --> 07:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
your testimony I think we're all set
 
07:15:23.360 --> 07:15:26.628 align:start position:0%
your testimony I think we're all set
thank

07:15:26.628 --> 07:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:29.030 --> 07:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
you Ben
 
07:15:31.468 --> 07:15:31.478 align:start position:0%
Frost for the last time
 
07:15:31.478 --> 07:15:34.468 align:start position:0%
Frost for the last time
today

07:15:34.468 --> 07:15:34.478 align:start position:0%
today
 
07:15:38.868 --> 07:15:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:41.030 --> 07:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
chairman good afternoon thank you Mr
 
07:15:43.468 --> 07:15:43.478 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Ben Frost deputy director
 
07:15:45.110 --> 07:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
and chief legal officer at new hampter
 
07:15:47.150 --> 07:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
housing uh we are in support of this
 
07:15:50.190 --> 07:15:50.200 align:start position:0%
legislation and just by note of
 
07:15:52.230 --> 07:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
reference New Hampshire housing among
 
07:15:54.070 --> 07:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
variety of things that we do we Finance
 
07:15:56.708 --> 07:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
the construction and long-term asset
 
07:15:59.788 --> 07:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
management of affordable rental housing
 
07:16:01.468 --> 07:16:01.478 align:start position:0%
uh when I look at the plans that are
 
07:16:03.750 --> 07:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
submitted To Us by developers I
 
07:16:05.788 --> 07:16:05.798 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that generally speaking
 
07:16:09.350 --> 07:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
about half of the developed area is
 
07:16:13.548 --> 07:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
parking uh and that is often times un
 
07:16:16.150 --> 07:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
well not not unused but it is uh
 
07:16:18.468 --> 07:16:18.478 align:start position:0%
inefficiently used that is there's a lot
 
07:16:21.350 --> 07:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
more parking than is actually needed
 
07:16:22.990 --> 07:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
by the developments that we
 
07:16:26.430 --> 07:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
finance that yields uh additional costs
 
07:16:30.110 --> 07:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
and reduced opportunities for housing
 
07:16:32.548 --> 07:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
because where there is required to be
 
07:16:35.110 --> 07:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
parking we could instead have more
 
07:16:37.590 --> 07:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
buildings housing more people creating
 
07:16:41.310 --> 07:16:41.320 align:start position:0%
more units um in in her testimony Ivy
 
07:16:44.310 --> 07:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
van talked about a a cost per per uh
 
07:16:46.708 --> 07:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
space uh there's been a lot of numbers
 
07:16:48.628 --> 07:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
around this all over the country does
 
07:16:50.350 --> 07:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
depend upon the cost of land wherever
 
07:16:51.990 --> 07:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
you have happen to be I've seen numbers
 
07:16:55.830 --> 07:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
in excess of $440,000 per parking space
 
07:16:59.190 --> 07:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
um which is just added to the cost of
 
07:17:02.030 --> 07:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
development uh and this gets to a notion
 
07:17:04.270 --> 07:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
among planners that's known as the high
 
07:17:07.110 --> 07:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
cost of free parking somebody's paying
 
07:17:09.628 --> 07:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
for it it may be free to the person
 
07:17:11.990 --> 07:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
who's parking the vehicle there as is in
 
07:17:14.548 --> 07:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
the developments that we Finance but the
 
07:17:16.830 --> 07:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
developer paying for that which means
 
07:17:18.270 --> 07:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
we're paying for it because we're
 
07:17:20.150 --> 07:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
financing the development of those those
 
07:17:20.160 --> 07:17:22.150 align:start position:0%
financing the development of those those
properties

07:17:22.150 --> 07:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
properties
 
07:17:26.750 --> 07:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
um I'll close with an object example of
 
07:17:28.868 --> 07:17:28.878 align:start position:0%
uh the Ridiculousness of some parking
 
07:17:31.070 --> 07:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
standards I live in the Town of Warner
 
07:17:32.830 --> 07:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
where I Serv as the planning board chair
 
07:17:35.230 --> 07:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
for uh seven years I was on the board
 
07:17:36.270 --> 07:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
for 12
 
07:17:38.708 --> 07:17:38.718 align:start position:0%
years if I had stayed longer I would
 
07:17:41.190 --> 07:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
have change would have tried to change
 
07:17:43.110 --> 07:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
something uh and that is the parking
 
07:17:45.070 --> 07:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
standards and I would have uh
 
07:17:46.670 --> 07:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
recommended eliminating the parking
 
07:17:49.110 --> 07:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
standards alt together and leave it to
 
07:17:51.750 --> 07:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the private Market to Fig f it out uh
 
07:17:53.590 --> 07:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
this this bill Deals Only with
 
07:17:57.388 --> 07:17:57.398 align:start position:0%
residential uh uses uh that is true but
 
07:18:00.468 --> 07:18:00.478 align:start position:0%
the the example from Warner is probably
 
07:18:02.868 --> 07:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
the best parcel of land in the center of
 
07:18:02.878 --> 07:18:03.590 align:start position:0%
the best parcel of land in the center of
the

07:18:03.590 --> 07:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:18:06.990 --> 07:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
village is a Surface parking lot because
 
07:18:09.150 --> 07:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
the planning board required
 
07:18:12.708 --> 07:18:12.718 align:start position:0%
it for the uh commercial use across the
 
07:18:17.708 --> 07:18:17.718 align:start position:0%
street this is property that should be
 
07:18:21.270 --> 07:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
developed and it's just a parking
 
07:18:26.150 --> 07:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
lot literally one foot away from on
 
07:18:26.160 --> 07:18:27.708 align:start position:0%
lot literally one foot away from on
street

07:18:27.708 --> 07:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
street
 
07:18:30.110 --> 07:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
parking it is totally
 
07:18:32.030 --> 07:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary as is so many of the
 
07:18:35.110 --> 07:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
regulations we face so happy to take any
 
07:18:37.190 --> 07:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
07:18:41.708 --> 07:18:41.718 align:start position:0%
yell thank you um since you do this
 
07:18:46.708 --> 07:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
financing um have you been able to uh in
 
07:18:51.270 --> 07:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
different municipalities or or uh in the
 
07:18:53.548 --> 07:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
different projects that you've you've uh
 
07:18:55.670 --> 07:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
financed have you been able to
 
07:19:03.350 --> 07:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
quantify um the cost in New Hampshire to
 
07:19:08.628 --> 07:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh this increased requirement for for uh
 
07:19:11.388 --> 07:19:11.398 align:start position:0%
parking thank you for the question uh
 
07:19:15.310 --> 07:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
and no we have not done it we are we
 
07:19:17.350 --> 07:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
could do it if we if we chose to and I
 
07:19:18.788 --> 07:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's an interesting
 
07:19:20.708 --> 07:19:20.718 align:start position:0%
research question that I'd be interested
 
07:19:20.718 --> 07:19:23.270 align:start position:0%
research question that I'd be interested
in

07:19:23.270 --> 07:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:27.670 --> 07:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
pursuing I have a question um how would
 
07:19:30.070 --> 07:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
this Bill affect mixed
 
07:19:32.910 --> 07:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
use um development or areas I know it
 
07:19:35.750 --> 07:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
says just residential but I think about
 
07:19:38.590 --> 07:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
you know in the perfect world when you
 
07:19:41.030 --> 07:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
in a world when you have a Whole Foods
 
07:19:42.750 --> 07:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
on the first floor and then a bunch of
 
07:19:44.868 --> 07:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
like like how would this Bill affect
 
07:19:46.708 --> 07:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
that directly when it's zoned for mixed
 
07:19:48.230 --> 07:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
use or is mixed use development Mr
 
07:19:50.150 --> 07:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
chairman that is a terrific question and
 
07:19:52.868 --> 07:19:52.878 align:start position:0%
I think it uh the the way this bill
 
07:19:54.910 --> 07:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
would work is it applies only to
 
07:19:56.548 --> 07:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
residential that are zon solely for
 
07:19:59.830 --> 07:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
residential purposes it it says it says
 
07:20:02.270 --> 07:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
residential parking spaces per unit
 
07:20:04.150 --> 07:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
forget about the zoning is it's it's the
 
07:20:07.150 --> 07:20:07.160 align:start position:0%
use that we're talking about so um let's
 
07:20:09.788 --> 07:20:09.798 align:start position:0%
say you're dealing with a mixed use
 
07:20:13.070 --> 07:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
development this is a great opportunity
 
07:20:16.590 --> 07:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
for what's known as shared parking so
 
07:20:19.590 --> 07:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
daytime commercial use evening time
 
07:20:22.070 --> 07:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
residential use
 
07:20:25.430 --> 07:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you the last
 
07:20:31.388 --> 07:20:31.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:20:34.510 --> 07:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
Kipper welcome thank you chairman thank
 
07:20:37.190 --> 07:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
you my name is John Kyper I'm from New
 
07:20:40.190 --> 07:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
Market and uh I'm here because I own a
 
07:20:43.230 --> 07:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
little restaurant in New Market and I
 
07:20:45.388 --> 07:20:45.398 align:start position:0%
have uh five or six employees most of
 
07:20:47.868 --> 07:20:47.878 align:start position:0%
them walk to work half of them do not
 
07:20:51.150 --> 07:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
own cars uh and there some proposed
 
07:20:53.030 --> 07:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
development of Workforce housing in our
 
07:20:55.510 --> 07:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
town and a lot of the push back about
 
07:20:57.388 --> 07:20:57.398 align:start position:0%
that Workforce housing is based around
 
07:20:59.788 --> 07:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
the parking requirements and whether or
 
07:21:02.548 --> 07:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
not there's enough space for the 60
 
07:21:04.910 --> 07:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
spots required for the 30 units that are
 
07:21:09.510 --> 07:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
proposed um and I just I think that uh
 
07:21:12.430 --> 07:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would help alleviate that
 
07:21:15.708 --> 07:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
issue which um I think parking becomes
 
07:21:17.190 --> 07:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
one of those things that people bring up
 
07:21:18.750 --> 07:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
when they just really don't want any
 
07:21:20.990 --> 07:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
more development in their town and if
 
07:21:22.190 --> 07:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
that's the issue then we should talk
 
07:21:24.030 --> 07:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
about that issue but you know I I hate
 
07:21:25.150 --> 07:21:25.160 align:start position:0%
it when people bring up parking what
 
07:21:26.990 --> 07:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
they really mean is that they don't want
 
07:21:29.270 --> 07:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
any more buildings built anywhere in New
 
07:21:31.070 --> 07:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you I'm having to take
 
07:21:33.030 --> 07:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
07:21:35.310 --> 07:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
07:21:37.468 --> 07:21:37.478 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you for bringing up the
 
07:21:40.750 --> 07:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:43.708 --> 07:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
room represent
 
07:21:46.110 --> 07:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
mononi thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
07:21:49.070 --> 07:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
for waiting all the way through for that
 
07:21:51.910 --> 07:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
um could you just elaborate you you're a
 
07:21:54.510 --> 07:21:54.520 align:start position:0%
business owner uh how many parking
 
07:21:56.830 --> 07:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
spaces have they required you to have
 
07:21:59.388 --> 07:21:59.398 align:start position:0%
for your business and it sounds like
 
07:22:02.910 --> 07:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
you're in a walking area yeah we um the
 
07:22:05.350 --> 07:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
downtown area of our town does not
 
07:22:08.070 --> 07:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
basically waves the parking requirements
 
07:22:11.510 --> 07:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
um that said uh I rent parking I
 
07:22:12.868 --> 07:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
actually rent from a Chinese restaurant
 
07:22:15.070 --> 07:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
next door and from another you know guy
 
07:22:18.070 --> 07:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
around the corner um our downtown area
 
07:22:19.910 --> 07:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
has a lot of apartments that have no
 
07:22:19.920 --> 07:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
has a lot of apartments that have no
parking

07:22:21.030 --> 07:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
parking
 
07:22:22.270 --> 07:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
and people just you know they figure it
 
07:22:24.510 --> 07:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
out if you know and I lived downtown
 
07:22:25.708 --> 07:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
before I opened my restaurant and me and
 
07:22:27.070 --> 07:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
my girlfriend just got one car and
 
07:22:30.070 --> 07:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
honestly it was way cheaper you know and
 
07:22:32.070 --> 07:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
I look at my parents they um they're
 
07:22:34.628 --> 07:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
retired they have two cars and there's
 
07:22:36.548 --> 07:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
almost never a time when both of my
 
07:22:38.030 --> 07:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
parents are leaving the house at the
 
07:22:39.788 --> 07:22:39.798 align:start position:0%
same time and if they moved into an
 
07:22:41.468 --> 07:22:41.478 align:start position:0%
apartment with just one unit you know
 
07:22:43.388 --> 07:22:43.398 align:start position:0%
one parking unit they would be fine with
 
07:22:45.110 --> 07:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
just one car and I think people just
 
07:22:48.670 --> 07:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
learn to adapt thank you
 
07:22:51.788 --> 07:22:51.798 align:start position:0%
sir any other question representative
 
07:22:55.548 --> 07:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
Reed I was waiting I apologize Mr chair
 
07:22:58.150 --> 07:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't really pertinent but thank
 
07:23:00.788 --> 07:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
you illustrious constituent for showing
 
07:23:04.468 --> 07:23:04.478 align:start position:0%
up and I uh would you believe that the
 
07:23:06.430 --> 07:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
food served at your restaurant is quite
 
07:23:08.230 --> 07:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
delicious and I would highly recommend
 
07:23:11.110 --> 07:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
anyone visit Johnny Boston New Market
 
07:23:12.510 --> 07:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much thank you
 
07:23:15.308 --> 07:23:15.318 align:start position:0%
for your testimony okay so with that I'm
 
07:23:17.030 --> 07:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing on
 
07:23:19.270 --> 07:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
hp400 before we all run out of here as
 
07:23:21.670 --> 07:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
committee I guess I want your feedback
 
07:23:23.590 --> 07:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
on the bills we've heard today so
 
07:23:25.230 --> 07:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we will be coming back to here
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
on hb1 1291 but I want to know where
 
07:23:29.670 --> 07:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
everyone is at on the other bills if
 
07:23:32.308 --> 07:23:32.318 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable going to an executive
 
07:23:34.670 --> 07:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
session if we need a work session kind
 
07:23:39.230 --> 07:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:43.388 --> 07:23:43.398 align:start position:0%
gives my feeling is that we or at least
 
07:23:46.070 --> 07:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
I need a little more time to think and
 
07:23:47.708 --> 07:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
go over some of the written
 
07:23:50.308 --> 07:23:50.318 align:start position:0%
documentation that's been given to us
 
07:23:51.910 --> 07:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
and I know that there's at least one
 
07:23:53.430 --> 07:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill that I'm going to work on what
 
07:23:56.388 --> 07:23:56.398 align:start position:0%
should be a pretty simple um Amendment
 
07:23:58.830 --> 07:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation but I I do think that
 
07:24:01.270 --> 07:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to need a general work
 
07:24:03.430 --> 07:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
session um there are a couple of bills
 
07:24:04.948 --> 07:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
where we've said specifically we need a
 
07:24:07.388 --> 07:24:07.398 align:start position:0%
work session and then we can leave it
 
07:24:09.788 --> 07:24:09.798 align:start position:0%
open in case there's anything else so I
 
07:24:11.990 --> 07:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't think we're ready to go into
 
07:24:14.190 --> 07:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
executive session until we've had at
 
07:24:16.628 --> 07:24:16.638 align:start position:0%
least one work session and I I'm not
 
07:24:18.990 --> 07:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
ready to provide feedback uh at this
 
07:24:21.350 --> 07:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
time I don't know I mean I I generally
 
07:24:22.590 --> 07:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
support a lot of the bills that have
 
07:24:25.590 --> 07:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
been presented but beyond that uh I
 
07:24:27.110 --> 07:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm ready to provide
 
07:24:28.868 --> 07:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
feedback I don't know if others are okay
 
07:24:30.308 --> 07:24:30.318 align:start position:0%
so you're saying a day maybe the public
 
07:24:32.150 --> 07:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
Hearing in a work session following the
 
07:24:33.990 --> 07:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
other public hearing we have okay makes
 
07:24:36.308 --> 07:24:36.318 align:start position:0%
sense representative Reed thank you Mr
 
07:24:39.430 --> 07:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
Chair by my count um I believe every
 
07:24:41.230 --> 07:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
single one of the bills we heard we
 
07:24:43.308 --> 07:24:43.318 align:start position:0%
mentioned an amendment um with the
 
07:24:45.708 --> 07:24:45.718 align:start position:0%
possible exception of the very first one
 
07:24:48.708 --> 07:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
which I did have a proposed amendment in
 
07:24:51.190 --> 07:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
mind for that which was merely adding
 
07:24:53.510 --> 07:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
this committee should it continue to
 
07:24:55.830 --> 07:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
exist in the following term to the list
 
07:24:57.670 --> 07:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
of entities that that that study
 
07:25:00.070 --> 07:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee would report to I would
 
07:25:02.788 --> 07:25:02.798 align:start position:0%
support that Amendment but um if people
 
07:25:04.948 --> 07:25:04.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to execute positively right now I
 
07:25:07.190 --> 07:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
would uh go along with that other than
 
07:25:09.548 --> 07:25:09.558 align:start position:0%
that um I think every single one we went
 
07:25:11.510 --> 07:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
through we talked we asked people
 
07:25:14.388 --> 07:25:14.398 align:start position:0%
testifying for Amendment language
 
07:25:17.388 --> 07:25:17.398 align:start position:0%
um I did step out for a bit but I have
 
07:25:20.510 --> 07:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment notes on every single one okay
 
07:25:22.270 --> 07:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
represent makoni thank you Mr chairman I
 
07:25:25.190 --> 07:25:25.200 align:start position:0%

07:25:37.990 --> 07:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
willing to go full day and Hammer out I
 
07:25:39.910 --> 07:25:39.920 align:start position:0%

07:25:42.548 --> 07:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
of thank you represent birdie yeah we
 
07:25:46.670 --> 07:25:46.680 align:start position:0%

representative Gibb sentiments um I
 
07:26:02.548 --> 07:26:02.558 align:start position:0%
believe that uh at this point in time
 
07:26:04.788 --> 07:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm airm uh in support of every
 
07:26:06.468 --> 07:26:06.478 align:start position:0%
one of the bills we've heard with some
 
07:26:09.110 --> 07:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
minor adjustments nothing substantive
 
07:26:12.388 --> 07:26:12.398 align:start position:0%

07:26:14.230 --> 07:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning public hearing on

the remaining bill after that work
 
07:26:19.150 --> 07:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
session exective in the afternoon
 
07:26:21.708 --> 07:26:21.718 align:start position:0%
representa d
 
07:26:25.430 --> 07:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
mostly agreed with what has been said um
 
07:26:27.628 --> 07:26:27.638 align:start position:0%
wondering and I'm not sure if this is
 
07:26:29.708 --> 07:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
protocol if we can do some work on
 
07:26:31.708 --> 07:26:31.718 align:start position:0%
drafting amendments to bring to that
 
07:26:33.708 --> 07:26:33.718 align:start position:0%
work session I'm thinking and I'm sure
 
07:26:34.990 --> 07:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
other folks have seen this in other
 
07:26:36.990 --> 07:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee work OLS is not rolling things
 
07:26:40.788 --> 07:26:40.798 align:start position:0%
out real fast so if we're we might want
 
07:26:43.308 --> 07:26:43.318 align:start position:0%
to be preemptive will get out yeah
 
07:26:44.910 --> 07:26:44.920 align:start position:0%
though if you if you set a deadline on
 
07:26:47.868 --> 07:26:47.878 align:start position:0%
them and let them know um I will say
 
07:26:50.510 --> 07:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
like as long as it's less than a four
 
07:26:52.430 --> 07:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
of the committee so if you want to form
 
07:26:54.110 --> 07:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
your own group and chat real quick about
 
07:26:56.788 --> 07:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
a bill create amendment that works um
 
07:26:56.798 --> 07:26:58.590 align:start position:0%
a bill create amendment that works um
represent

07:26:58.590 --> 07:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
07:27:04.110 --> 07:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
Kell um thank you um my thoughts are on
 
07:27:08.948 --> 07:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
the the um committee Bill the uh study
 
07:27:10.948 --> 07:27:10.958 align:start position:0%
committee the first bill of the day I
 
07:27:14.190 --> 07:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
think that um I would not be in support
 
07:27:16.830 --> 07:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
of creating another committee I think
 
07:27:19.388 --> 07:27:19.398 align:start position:0%
that I think that a subcommittee of this
 
07:27:19.398 --> 07:27:20.628 align:start position:0%
that I think that a subcommittee of this
committee

07:27:20.628 --> 07:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
committee
 
07:27:27.670 --> 07:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
would be fine and I think that uh such a
 
07:27:29.990 --> 07:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee should um
 
07:27:33.868 --> 07:27:33.878 align:start position:0%
have uh hearings in throughout the state
 
07:27:35.990 --> 07:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
or whatever and and just do the work I
 
07:27:38.670 --> 07:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
don't think that um creating another one
 
07:27:41.030 --> 07:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be necessary just to get
 
07:27:44.468 --> 07:27:44.478 align:start position:0%
more State reps involved
 
07:27:50.270 --> 07:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I think that the I would like to see
 
07:27:52.788 --> 07:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
um essentially like work
 
07:27:52.798 --> 07:27:54.510 align:start position:0%
um essentially like work
sessions

07:27:54.510 --> 07:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
07:27:59.670 --> 07:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
um of of significant length probably
 
07:28:03.990 --> 07:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
um the opportunity to do probably
 
07:28:07.548 --> 07:28:07.558 align:start position:0%
one for maybe only one a day or
 
07:28:11.590 --> 07:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
something like that for uh or or it
 
07:28:13.708 --> 07:28:13.718 align:start position:0%
could be just com like combine them all
 
07:28:16.308 --> 07:28:16.318 align:start position:0%
into one work session the problem is I
 
07:28:19.230 --> 07:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
think that we would have people showing
 
07:28:20.948 --> 07:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
up for something that we might not even
 
07:28:26.788 --> 07:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
get to that day um and so I uh either
 
07:28:28.750 --> 07:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
like a subcommittee for each of the
 
07:28:32.070 --> 07:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
bills um except for the parking one I
 
07:28:34.110 --> 07:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
don't think that one requires ve very
 
07:28:39.510 --> 07:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
much much time but um I think that uh
 
07:28:43.430 --> 07:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
the only one I'm really concerned of
 
07:28:46.308 --> 07:28:46.318 align:start position:0%
that has uh requires I think a lot of
 
07:28:53.190 --> 07:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
work is the two the the um two
 
07:28:57.868 --> 07:28:57.878 align:start position:0%
uh duplex unit duplex one because I've
 
07:29:01.230 --> 07:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
that one is just has a lot of
 
07:29:04.788 --> 07:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
requirements and stuff like that so um
 
07:29:07.230 --> 07:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
that's my my thoughts on the subject so
 
07:29:08.150 --> 07:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you take them for what they're
 
07:29:10.990 --> 07:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
worth um representative Reed thank you I
 
07:29:13.350 --> 07:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
actually agree with representative mcc's
 
07:29:15.350 --> 07:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
assessment that
 
07:29:18.510 --> 07:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm presuming is is March 8th the
 
07:29:21.628 --> 07:29:21.638 align:start position:0%
correct the Friday of the week after the
 
07:29:25.868 --> 07:29:25.878 align:start position:0%
vacation okay um 1291 and first thing in
 
07:29:27.830 --> 07:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
the morning followed by a full day full
 
07:29:30.830 --> 07:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee exe or so not exe work session
 
07:29:33.388 --> 07:29:33.398 align:start position:0%
on all the bills that were heard today
 
07:29:35.670 --> 07:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
and that nobody would be showing up
 
07:29:37.910 --> 07:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
because the only hearing is 1291 so
 
07:29:40.070 --> 07:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
people are showing up for 1291 people
 
07:29:41.388 --> 07:29:41.398 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to show up for
 
07:29:42.990 --> 07:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
the work session because they're not
 
07:29:45.468 --> 07:29:45.478 align:start position:0%
automatically given the right to speak
 
07:29:47.830 --> 07:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
but going back to the study committee
 
07:29:51.070 --> 07:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill I think it was we showed our
 
07:29:54.548 --> 07:29:54.558 align:start position:0%
ignorance on issues of disability in
 
07:29:57.548 --> 07:29:57.558 align:start position:0%
this committee today because and I know
 
07:30:00.510 --> 07:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
I personally was in tears um there are
 
07:30:03.948 --> 07:30:03.958 align:start position:0%
members of the House who uh belong to a
 
07:30:06.670 --> 07:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
disability caucus who would be much more
 
07:30:08.628 --> 07:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
Well Suited this is something that needs
 
07:30:10.910 --> 07:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
repeated meetings much like we had much
 
07:30:13.548 --> 07:30:13.558 align:start position:0%
like as the chair had scheduled repeated
 
07:30:15.830 --> 07:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
presentations from different groups uh
 
07:30:18.190 --> 07:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
all last year for us this is something
 
07:30:19.548 --> 07:30:19.558 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to meet repe
 
07:30:22.830 --> 07:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
repeatedly disability issues are complex
 
07:30:25.230 --> 07:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
we went down the rabbit hole on one tiny
 
07:30:28.468 --> 07:30:28.478 align:start position:0%
tiny tiny piece of it so I think this
 
07:30:30.270 --> 07:30:30.280 align:start position:0%
committee should wholeheartedly
 
07:30:33.628 --> 07:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
completely support the study
 
07:30:36.590 --> 07:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
committee okay representative
 
07:30:39.590 --> 07:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you uh I just heard a re
 
07:30:42.150 --> 07:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
reference to uh our next meeting
 
07:30:44.670 --> 07:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
possibly being on March 8th and
 
07:30:46.510 --> 07:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I need I checked my
 
07:30:48.910 --> 07:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
calendar and I need to point out that I
 
07:30:51.110 --> 07:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
have a County delegation meeting uh
 
07:30:53.948 --> 07:30:53.958 align:start position:0%
maram County delegation meeting on March
 
07:30:56.510 --> 07:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
8th um wouldn't that be in the evening
 
07:30:59.230 --> 07:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
no it's in the morning what time uh so
 
07:31:02.308 --> 07:31:02.318 align:start position:0%
in the morning of March 8th um what time
 
07:31:05.270 --> 07:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
sorry what time 10 o'clock okay and it
 
07:31:08.430 --> 07:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
probably go till about noon
 
07:31:14.308 --> 07:31:14.318 align:start position:0%
okay okay any other feedback okay yes oh
 
07:31:17.430 --> 07:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
represent wall uh going back to the uh
 
07:31:19.628 --> 07:31:19.638 align:start position:0%
the disability study committee bill one
 
07:31:21.150 --> 07:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
thing we have to be aware of this is an
 
07:31:23.830 --> 07:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
election year and that bill sets the
 
07:31:27.150 --> 07:31:27.160 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline for November of this
 
07:31:30.388 --> 07:31:30.398 align:start position:0%
year so just keep that in mind folks
 
07:31:32.830 --> 07:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
well I I would be happy amending the
 
07:31:34.788 --> 07:31:34.798 align:start position:0%
reporting deadline as well as like I
 
07:31:36.430 --> 07:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
said I think that this committee is
 
07:31:40.750 --> 07:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
suitable to be reported to by that study
 
07:31:44.150 --> 07:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee okay all right so um standby
 
07:31:46.830 --> 07:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
on a on a date following up on the next
 
07:31:48.468 --> 07:31:48.478 align:start position:0%
public hearing I think I might still do
 
07:31:50.750 --> 07:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
it on March 8th at least the public
 
07:31:53.070 --> 07:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
hearing but um we'll have the work
 
07:31:54.590 --> 07:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
session following that in the afternoon
 
07:31:56.150 --> 07:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
if the work session was at 1 she'd be
 
07:32:00.590 --> 07:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
able to get it I think y y okay well
 
07:32:02.030 --> 07:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much it's been a long day
 
07:32:03.388 --> 07:32:03.398 align:start position:0%
I appreciate everybody slugging along
 
07:32:18.230 --> 07:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:18.240 --> 07:32:21.240 align:start position:0%
