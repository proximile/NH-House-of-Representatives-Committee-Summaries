00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.869 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
Brown will turn that who will turn that
 
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
a pink card when he gets a
 
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 align:start position:0%
chance I say again he couldn't hear you
 
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
who will turn in a pink card when he
 
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
gets the chance I will do that yes uh
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and good morning
 
00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 align:start position:0%
uh fellow committee members it's nice to
 
00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
be here in front of all of you so a
 
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of a story I'm going to tell
 
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
here which will actually carry over to
 
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
the the one I'm going to do at 11:00
 
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
that way I won't have to tell that story
 
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
then so going back to May of 2023 last
 
00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 align:start position:0%
year I had a call from a constituent and
 
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
that constituent said I have a new
 
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
business and the state's business and
 
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
economic development website has not
 
00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
updated my business in five years ago
 
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm getting calls from people saying
 
00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
your website says this and I'm a new
 
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
owner and that's not accurate
 
00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
so this constituent was trying to get a
 
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
hold of someone to fix that and he
 
00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't and it had been on the on the
 
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
on the verge of maybe three weeks he'd
 
00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 align:start position:0%
been waiting for someone to help him out
 
00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
so he called me and I went over and
 
00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
talked to him I said okay let me see
 
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
what I can do so the first thing I did
 
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
was I went to the
 
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
website for visit nh.gov and well I'll
 
00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
talk about that at 11 o'clock and more
 
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
length I couldn't find a phone number
 
00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
there and then um I finally figured out
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
it was business in Economic Development
 
00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
and I went to the state's employee
 
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
directory and found the commissioner's
 
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
office number and called there that
 
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
would have been let me see let me get
 
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 align:start position:0%
this right that was Monday May 21st I
 
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
called left a message at the
 
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioner's Office on on the
 
00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
voicemail by Friday that week the 26th I
 
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
had heard nothing back I called the
 
00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 align:start position:0%
following Monday on the 31st and left
 
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
the message and I heard nothing back and
 
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
finally I called the following day on
 
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
Tuesday Tuesday and did get a human in
 
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office to talk to me
 
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
and they eventually put me through to
 
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
someone who called me back problem
 
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
solved everything taken care of um and
 
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
that got me to thinking that that having
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
as you know been a state employee and
 
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
trying to have been a good public
 
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
servant that that was just way too slow
 
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
and there was something wrong with that
 
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
process so I thought maybe we could
 
00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 align:start position:0%
solve this in in a way that was as I've
 
00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
been told by a a state agent this week
 
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's a blunt object to use a law to do
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
this but that may be the case and that's
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
okay so that's kind of the backstory to
 
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.990 align:start position:0%
okay so that's kind of the backstory to
this

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
um in another meeting from the deputy
 
00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 align:start position:0%
agitant General I on another bill I
 
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 align:start position:0%
heard that there was a problem with this
 
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
that he had heard from some other
 
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
agencies that this might bump into the
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
91a 5day
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
reporting allowance uh call back
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
allowance and the whereas this is only 3
 
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
days so then I said okay I'll I'll I
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
picked six different agencies to call
 
00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
thought probably received a lot of
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
telephone calls heal human services DMV
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
do a
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
Dees and I can't remember what the other
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
two were and spoke to the Commissioner's
 
00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
Office Andor whoever they gave me to as
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
a representative so I had a lot of
 
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 align:start position:0%
um a lot of feedback health and humorous
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
Services said we probably get 3,000
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
calls a week because we have so many
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
programs and and if you were to pass
 
00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 align:start position:0%
this we probably would have to hire
 
00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 align:start position:0%
someone to track every one of those
 
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
calls to make sure I got called back in
 
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
three days seems like a legitimate
 
00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
statement to me and um I had some
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
similar statements from other agencies
 
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh I had one agency say well we're we're
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
not bad with the three days but how
 
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
would we ever do this with a voicemail
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
and track that we'd have to have a
 
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
person tracking every voicemail in the
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
agency so the the short story kind of
 
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
that is agencies were a little bit
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
hesitant on it and I I I understood
 
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
where they were coming from and I think
 
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
fair um what a number of the agents did
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
say agencies did say was maybe an
 
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.909 align:start position:0%
say agencies did say was maybe an
interim

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 align:start position:0%
interim
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
study maybe back up a little bit all of
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
them said every single one of them said
 
00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
this is probably a good idea
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
philosophically and we should be
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
concentrating on customer service as the
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office wants us to and it's
 
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea aidea to look at this in
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
some way and see if it's a problem and
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
the suggestion was that uh from a number
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
of them was to go to interim
 
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.909 align:start position:0%
of them was to go to interim
study

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
um make sure I covered everything I
 
00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.110 align:start position:0%
um make sure I covered everything I
wanted

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
to I also
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
heard interestingly enough as a side
 
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
issue on this from a couple of
 
00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
Representatives and from uh from a
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative in the governor's office
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
that it's not it's it's kind of
 
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
related there were those that wanted me
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
to add into here that there should be a
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
way to force agencies to call state
 
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
representatives back more quickly but
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
obviously I didn't want to clutter this
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
up with that but just for future
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
reference for all of you to consider
 
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
that there was uh there's some concern
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
about that I've never had that problem
 
00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
actually so anyway that's that's where
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
I'm at that's what I've got and I think
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
that the smartest thing might be to
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
interim study this this as we could
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
actually take a look
 
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
at what are the complaints coming in is
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
there a problem or is it just that I
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
happen to have a an individual issue
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
that seemed to be a problem and I I will
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
add to that that I have spoken to a
 
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 align:start position:0%
number of representatives and some of
 
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
them have said yes we we've uh found
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
similar problems uh one of the lawyers
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
in in town where I live said he had he's
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
had tough times with HHS and the court
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
system calls back so I don't think it's
 
00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
a an isolated incident um and I think
 
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
it's from a public service standpoint uh
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably worth following up on any
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
at nope representative goalie you have a
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
question oh okay well I believe
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you've explained it
 
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
so well that we don't have any questions
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:06.390 align:start position:0%

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
director for Health and Human Services
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
and represent Brown explained it so well
 
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 align:start position:0%
that I have no further commentary to
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
provide but otherwise supporting an
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
interm study for this Bill thank you are
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions Pres Smith can always count on
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
you to
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
contribute well my only question would
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
be that this describes the way things
 
00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:40.879 align:start position:0%
obviously should
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
happen and and uh it's not like the
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
people in the in the offices or bureaus
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever so-called bureaucrats are
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
sitting around trying to figure out ways
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
to avoid doing what the public has
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
requested them to do um but if you got
 
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
the proverbial 10 pounds of stuff in a
 
00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
five pound bag situation you got to get
 
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
another bag and or you got to take care
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
of what's backed up in front of you
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
so this is the this describes the ideal
 
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:18.280 align:start position:0%
world and this is not the world we live
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick uh thank you madam chair uh
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
I understand that the uh job of the
 
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
general court is
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
oversight but is
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh creating a mandate on how a member of
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
the executive branch uh performs their
 
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
duties is that an over an an overreach
 
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.160 align:start position:0%
for a legislative body you know se you
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
know separation of
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
powers um so chairman McGuire I do
 
00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and I do believe
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that there is a clear distinction in
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
terms of separations of powers but also
 
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of constitutional analysis
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
there's a meaningful collaboration
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
between the various um uh branches of
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
government that the Judiciary talks with
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
the legislature the legislature talks
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
with the executive branch and it you
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
know pretty much both of them and all
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
three of them communicate with each
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
other well uh I do think that in this
 
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
particular um matter uh that it's an
 
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:25.240 align:start position:0%
important issue I know working with the
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
legislators serving on this committee
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
that they certainly adhere to The
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
Standard of returning calls within three
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
days and for the few who I've had the
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
pleasure of working with they also know
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
I reciprocate and also I want to just
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
point out that representative Brown uh
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
per his tenure at the uh Department of
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services was noted for his
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
Civility and his receptiveness to
 
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
getting back to the public on questions
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly the department would
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
adhere that that goal is an important
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
goal however the legislation is
 
00:09:53.949 --> 00:09:53.959 align:start position:0%
currently drafted would present some
 
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:56.680 align:start position:0%
issues and but support an interim
 
00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
study thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
others thank you seeing none thank you
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
very much does anyone else wish to
 
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
testify on House Bill
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
1420 seeing none I'll close the public
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
hearing okay executive session
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative grer you have a a motion
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
yes I'll move inm study on House Bill
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
1420 and I'll second it
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes I
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
she I have one but I'm leaving this for
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
the day when she forgets to give us one
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's some in my middle left drawer
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
too okay great all right we have a
 
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
motion of interim study by
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
representative grer do you wish to speak
 
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes um occasionally I do
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
hear from constituents who have
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
difficulty in re reaching state
 
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.870 align:start position:0%
difficulty in re reaching state
agencies

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
and I call in their stad and I'm always
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
my calls are
 
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
always um responded to and I don't
 
00:11:07.389 --> 00:11:07.399 align:start position:0%
believe that it's because State
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
agencies don't want to speak to
 
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
constituents it's just that they they
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
realize that we may be calling for a
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
specific thing so I do believe I do
 
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
think that interim study is
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate because I'm torn between
 
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not this should be coming
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office to their
 
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
state agencies as opposed to us to the
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
state agencies I do think that if the
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
governor um thinks that customer service
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
is important then he should Institute a
 
00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:39.030 align:start position:0%
is important then he should Institute a
program

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
that um that that's designed for that so
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
let's take a look at it and see if we
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
can make recommendations and thank you
 
00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
for bringing the bill to us represent
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
lus thank you y i uh you know I think we
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
certainly have the authority and I think
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
the duty to do something like this I
 
00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
understand there's details to work out
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
but I hope that what comes out of inter
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
study is a recommendation for something
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
specific and maybe what happens if it
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
isn't met um but to deal with you know
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
whatever flexibility there might need to
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
be in certain
 
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances okay does anyone else have
 
00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.430 align:start position:0%
circumstances okay does anyone else have
a

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
comment represent BR you can join us
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're uh the testimony is over so
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
you're you're free to uh act as a member
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
committee yes
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
sh it thank you sorry I was moving the
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
mic um I do agree that um that seems to
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
be the case I've had constituents
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
contact me uh who've waited days or
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
weeks for an answer and when I call
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
usually within a day or two I get an
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
answer for them which doesn't seem right
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
but I suppose that is part of the role
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
that we play um I do agree with
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative groda that um this
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
basically involves the executive
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
department so the top executive should
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
be the one uh mandating this uh I will
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
also point out that part of the problem
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
could be that a lot of our departments
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
don't have enough help to handle all the
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
calls and inquiries that they get so
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's my main comment thank you
 
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
represent Blas yeah I agree that you
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
know at least for some the problem might
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
be staff and you know if there if we
 
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
were to give them a mandate something
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
like this whether it's this one or or
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
adjusted then uh you know it'd be their
 
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
job to ask for what they needed to
 
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
actually do it and well I don't like
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
spending money you know do giving good
 
00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
customer service I think is something we
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
have a duty to do yeah I'd like to
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
represent billan thank you madam chair I
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
wonder if this is more of more of just
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
an awareness issue I know um I've had an
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
personally had an issue Department of
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
Safety and I made a phone call and that
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
same day I had four phone calls back to
 
00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
me from different members of the agency
 
00:14:09.069 --> 00:14:09.079 align:start position:0%
to try to resolve the issue same thing
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
with constituent Services constituent
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
has an issue always get an immediate
 
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
response so I I wonder if it's just an
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
awareness in the agencies to be more uh
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
responsive and proactive uh and I I I
 
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
wonder if it really if it really needs
 
00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
an interim study or just
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh a blast back to the to maybe through
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's office that to to be to
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
be aware of the fact that some
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
constituents are having an issue well I
 
00:14:42.749 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
I think that this relates very much to
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative Brown's other bill
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
because I would guess a lot of the
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
problem is people call the first person
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
they think of and that person is not the
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
right person to answer the question and
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
so they say gee I don't know the answer
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
to that do I know anybody who might and
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do and sometimes they
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
don't and if they don't they're likely
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
to say well I'll look into it when I
 
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
have the time and therefore it takes a
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
long time to get to it so I I think that
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
the fact that the programs and the
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
contact points for the programs are not
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
always readily available to our
 
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
constituents is a big part of the
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
problem we call the commissioner and say
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
hey who's who's the point person on such
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
and such an issue and the commissioner
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
finds that person for us it's not the
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
same for somebody that's calling a
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
random person in HHS with a question
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative ly thank you madam chair
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
sorry for coming in late um but my
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
concern I mean a point that I want to
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
make with this regarding to this is even
 
00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:51.519 align:start position:0%
within the agency within the office the
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
shift of personnel I'll give you an
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
example for I asked for a proclamation
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
from this uh governor 's office and I
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
had sent all the information to the
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
individual that was doing that and 3
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
weeks later didn't hear nothing so I
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
went back to the governor's office and
 
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240 align:start position:0%
asked what happened oh that person moved
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
from that position this is the new
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
person I said so I need to know who the
 
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
new person is didn't hear
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
anything so that could happen within any
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
agency the moving of
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
yes okay anyone else have a comment
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%

with it probably won't do
 
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
anything because we were losing interest
 
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:24.679 align:start position:0%

ask

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and committee um my name
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
is uh representative Kelly Penza
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 um this bill came
 
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:15.909 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 um this bill came
to

00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
fruition uh
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
from a a meeting um that took place
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
between um a group of constituents as
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
well as legislators
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
um at the at the Department of
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services um that's where
 
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of this bill came in and then
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
just in talking to um fellow um fellow
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
constituents as well as
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
legislators it seems as if um people
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time in regards with
 
00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
public comment and in that public
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
comment it just kind of seems like it's
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
out in a in a um in a black hole in a
 
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.509 align:start position:0%
out in a in a um in a black hole in a
sense

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill in a sense takes the public
 
00:34:05.909 --> 00:34:05.919 align:start position:0%
comment puts it in a in a fashion that
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
it's online and um and then makes makes
 
00:34:12.669 --> 00:34:12.679 align:start position:0%
it so especially on the with all the
 
00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
agencies makes it so that there's like a
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
response um and some of these things are
 
00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:22.359 align:start position:0%
are huge huge items for the state and so
 
00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:25.639 align:start position:0%
um not knowing uh Specialists come in
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
scientists come in uh you know water
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
specialists in regards with the dees
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
conversation for example that took place
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
so I that's where that's where this bill
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
originated from so uh we have the
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
Technologies very easy to do um if
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
someone is giving a written Tech written
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
testimony it can just be scanned and put
 
00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
online um but it's that's really how
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
this whole uh Bill originated and um
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's got bipartisan support
 
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
this is uh just I think a way that we
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
should be having um some nice
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
transparency especially when people are
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
um spending the time uh sometimes people
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
travel hours on end to come and and
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
speak um at hearings at these agencies
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
and you know with Ru making and so
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where this whole bill
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
originated from if you have any
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.150 align:start position:0%
originated from if you have any
questions

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are you
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
aware that last year we amended the
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
procedure act to require the agency to
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
report and reply to comments received at
 
00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
the at the public hearing and I'm trying
 
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:45.320 align:start position:0%
to find out where exactly the citation
 
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
is but we did make a change to require a
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
response to
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
comments not quite as detailed as your
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
your bill but it's there and I'm trying
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
it I think the difference is there's
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
something that's um versus response
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
versus um an
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
explanation I mean I can tell you that
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
there are there are entities that spend
 
00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to be able to look things
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
over um because average people they're
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
not necessarily they're not scientists
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
and they don't and they don't know and
 
00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:26.839 align:start position:0%
they can't they they take some sometimes
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh what an agency says as you know that
 
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
that's it and and that's the problem if
 
00:36:35.069 --> 00:36:35.079 align:start position:0%
if we don't have if someone can say
 
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
that's not true and can refute that in
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
public testimony and then there's just a
 
00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
response saying okay well we you know
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
thanks for your comment great but don't
 
00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720 align:start position:0%
give an actual reason why something
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's valid especially when I'm talking
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
about something that's scientific um why
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
they're not going to take that into
 
00:36:58.829 --> 00:36:58.839 align:start position:0%
consideration is to me is just
 
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
negligent so I think that that agencies
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
are paid a lot of money and and uh in
 
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
regards and positions are and I think
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the public in a sense um needs
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a true explanation
 
00:37:18.309 --> 00:37:18.319 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't take into account um
 
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:19.670 align:start position:0%
why they wouldn't take into account um
really

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
thoughtful sometimes scientific expert
 
00:37:24.109 --> 00:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
testimony that comes
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
in thank you representative Dolan thank
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair uh in your in the bill
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
when uh the agency is required to
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
respond to public comment is is there
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
any requirement to have the the
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
response by the agency qualified or
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
reviewed for Content what if the
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
agency's response is argumentative or
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
not complete or uh not responsive to the
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
constituent how how how is that
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
captur it or follow it up
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
with well I guess you know in a sense
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
that the you know the public could bring
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
that to their representative uh so
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
someone like me that's the that's part
 
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the reason why this bill um is in
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
place because
 
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
some amazing testimony has just fallen
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
on deaf ear and this is not just in you
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
know that has to do with uh my committee
 
00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
you know in the agencies that we work
 
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
with this has been going on for a long
 
00:38:32.829 --> 00:38:32.839 align:start position:0%
time I I don't know in a sense how we
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
could police that I think putting this
 
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
bill in is holding um agencies
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
accountable and I think it's a step in
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the right direction and and also telling
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
folks that are
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
um that are that are testifying and all
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff that they have
 
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:55.640 align:start position:0%
this now to say okay um can you can you
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
here's the law can you give me a better
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
response this it's saying that you you
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
have to give me a full explanation about
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
why you know why this expert testimony
 
00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
considered any other questions
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
chair uh I guess following up on
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan's question um the
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
only thing that I noticed in the bill
 
00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
which I I have some experience with this
 
00:39:28.109 --> 00:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
deal deal with landfill setting
 
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:29.720 align:start position:0%
requirements in main where they do it
 
00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:31.079 align:start position:0%
and it's very helpful I mean in my
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
opinion uh my experience with it is very
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
helpful um the word significant in line
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
11 I'm just questioning whether or not
 
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's the right word there um what
 
00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:43.720 align:start position:0%
signifies significant I don't know if a
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
word like pertinence might be more
 
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.589 align:start position:0%
word like pertinence might be more
applicable

00:39:47.589 --> 00:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh what do you have any thoughts on that
 
00:39:52.829 --> 00:39:52.839 align:start position:0%
no that's a great question and a great
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
point right because that that is um what
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
qualifies that statement I'd be willing
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
to to you know I could make a word
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
change there not a problem
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
um pertinent would probably be a better
 
00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:08.490 align:start position:0%
um pertinent would probably be a better
choice

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:08.500 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:13.550 align:start position:0%
choice
[Music]

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
um okay that's that's fine I just wasn't
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
sure if you had any particular no I
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
just fair enough you when someone
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
responds with public combat right you
 
00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
know I oppose this bill I you know it
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't fit into my you know doesn't fit
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
into my agenda or whatever but versus
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
someone saying I oppose this bill
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
because it affects my life and this D D
 
00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:36.839 align:start position:0%
D D D D you know what I mean so
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
something that's significant meaning
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
like that's not just a you know I oppose
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
this bill in in a oneline sentence so
 
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:47.720 align:start position:0%
significant was substantial but but I
 
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
think maybe pertinent or something could
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
be better choice or even removing that
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
um even removing significant allog
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
together and just having it be
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
argument followup um yeah I want to be
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
careful that I'm actually asking a
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
question um but so you're you're okay
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
with a word change there yeah I'd be
 
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
hesitant to take the word out altogether
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
because then it becomes somebody wants
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
to change the font on it and you know
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
then the department has to respond and
 
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
you don't want to get frivolous so I
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
understand the the need for the word
 
00:41:22.589 --> 00:41:22.599 align:start position:0%
there um so that's fine um other just
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
real quick comment if I might I would
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
assume that the somebody go to the
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
courts as well if they felt like I mean
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
there's obviously no civil or criminal
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
penalty involved but they could sue to
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
get the Department to make a response
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be my
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
assumption they can also Sue to overturn
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
the rule if they like right representa
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I I think
 
00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:47.720 align:start position:0%
maybe following up by representative
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
Dolan a little bit so if if you have
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
have the wonderful experience of reading
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
the Federal Register and the development
 
00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
of rules in the CFR
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
when there's a rule that's coming out
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
they have a generally a fairly lengthy
 
00:42:03.829 --> 00:42:03.839 align:start position:0%
piece at the beginning of that that
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
explains how many people had comments
 
00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then they address every
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
comment in the beginning of the the
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
Federal Register but what happens is
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
they basically address those comments
 
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
and say here's our decision end of story
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
is is that kind of so this is just going
 
00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
to be we heard your argument here's our
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
answer to you and then moving forward is
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
guess I'm familiar uh a person that
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
helped me craft this is very familiar
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
with the federal process so
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
um the federal process is ex is they do
 
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
a good job right in regards with listing
 
00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
all of that and but the piece that's
 
00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
different here is it's not um this is
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
before the decision we want these things
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be disc we don't want this to come of
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
course after the decision so um
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
there there would have to there has to
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
be a reason so let's say if it it has to
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
do with
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
um let's say it has to do with landfill
 
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.710 align:start position:0%
um let's say it has to do with landfill
sighting

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:11.720 align:start position:0%
sighting
 
00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:15.559 align:start position:0%
if if specifically there's 10 items that
 
00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
are on there that are you know 10 issues
 
00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.309 align:start position:0%
are on there that are you know 10 issues
with

00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
um with with the rules that are being
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
proposed and none of those issues have
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
really had an argument that's come back
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
that it from the agency that has said
 
00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay well you know we're able to prove
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
that you know this is not a problem this
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
is not a problem this is not a
 
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
problem then we're hoping that this is
 
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:44.680 align:start position:0%
going to make them reconsider before
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
they just blanketly say oh no we've just
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
decided so that's the point I I
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
understand where you're coming from the
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
FED they they do they very transparent I
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
love how um I actually looked at where
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
the comments are uh you know for all to
 
00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
see which is wonderful that's what we're
 
00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
looking for here as well um but this is
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
kind of like we would really like them
 
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more intentional so
 
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
when we had this meeting for example
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
with Dees it was it was clear there was
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of stakeholders around the table
 
00:44:20.549 --> 00:44:20.559 align:start position:0%
and um it was a really good conversation
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
but that's why this came out and to be
 
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
honest one of the gentlemen that deals
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
with all of the public you know kind of
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
the public comment piece in his division
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
um and I think he was in in air
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
resources um was he thought that this
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
was great so you know I don't know this
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
isn't specific to any one agency so I'm
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if there's going to be people
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
behind me that are going to say they
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't want this I don't I don't know
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
but so um but uh I I think that this
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is great because it should in a
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
sense help keep people feeling like
 
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:03.640 align:start position:0%
their voices are heard I mean right the
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
I work for the people and um and that's
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
the whole point of this and I just want
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
to make as
 
00:45:13.069 --> 00:45:13.079 align:start position:0%
transparence transparency but also the
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
amount of amazing citizen experts that
 
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.280 align:start position:0%
we have is huge and I want people to be
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
able to see that kind of testimony
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
online and that's the kind of stuff that
 
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
you can see on the federal side that no
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
one even knows about you wouldn't I have
 
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's such a well um a wealth of
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
resource for so many people so thank you
 
00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.630 align:start position:0%
resource for so many people so thank you
other

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions okay are you aware of RSA 541
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
A2 Roman
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
2E which in case you don't have it
 
00:45:50.549 --> 00:45:50.559 align:start position:0%
memorized I do not probably not says
 
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
that when they're issuing the final rule
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
which that will then come before Jael
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
car is that they must include a report
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
of public comments received and an
 
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:03.640 align:start position:0%
explanation of how they were addressed
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe it's redundant I
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
think this is prior to and if it could
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
um that could also
 
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.549 align:start position:0%
um that could also
[Music]

00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
um that could also alleviate maybe that
 
00:46:28.549 --> 00:46:28.559 align:start position:0%
piece too so if it's happening um if
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
they've already done it like the this
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
way then they probably would just maybe
 
00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
have to do a copy paste it wouldn't have
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
to do a second set of work if I'm making
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
myself clear yes okay what was that
 
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
reference 541 a colon 12 Roman 2 little
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
e thank you i' got to find
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
that okay but that all right thank you
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
yes represent G on that reference in
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
that that you're reading does it say who
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
the report needs to go to it is issu it
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
is part of the final package of of the
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
package of the final rule which is being
 
00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:17.000 align:start position:0%
brought to before Jael car for approval
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
so Jael car is the only one that
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
receives the report it's a public
 
00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
document it's posted on the website
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
prior to the jel car meeting okay thank
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
you not the easiest to find but it is
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
there I was just going to say that's
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
before I um before I became a legislator
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
I was kind of an activist if that's what
 
00:47:41.349 --> 00:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
you want to call me um so and I didn't
 
00:47:44.549 --> 00:47:44.559 align:start position:0%
understand and most people don't um they
 
00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
don't I mean it's really even hard for
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
people to understand like they get the
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
basics how a bill becomes a law but just
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
even from committee and then
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the voting in the
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee and then going to the house
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
and and then to have to realize that
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
there's also this other piece with JL
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
car um I would have to say 90 99% of
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire um that are not
 
00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
in politics have no idea about that
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
piece at all so you would I would not be
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
correct okay anyone else representative
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um having
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
served on jel car myself
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh I'm well aware of the complaints that
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
we hear constantly how long it takes to
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
get things through
 
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
rules um and seeing in um section two
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral 3 uh provided
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
that the rule shall not be effective or
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
its adob adoption shall be postponed
 
00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
until 90 days after the agency
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
explanation required is posted on the
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
agency's website so would you not say
 
00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:00.799 align:start position:0%
that that is further prolonging the
 
00:49:00.799 --> 00:49:02.710 align:start position:0%
that that is further prolonging the
whole

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:12.829 align:start position:0%
whole
process

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
um I guess it could be I wasn't looking
 
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.030 align:start position:0%
at it that way
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:20.549 align:start position:0%
at it that way
[Music]

00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
um I was I was looking at from the time
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
that you know the rul making piece kind
 
00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
of begins to um with public comment and
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
and I actually use that
 
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:36.680 align:start position:0%
90day based upon that conversation with
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
that person from Dees but I would be
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
happy to look at that if it was going to
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
um we don't I don't want anything to be
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
rushed because I want people to be have
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
to have enough time of course but I also
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to hold things up either so
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
um some of these rules that we have as
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know are in effect for some that
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
have they don't get changed they're in
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
effect for over a decade and so I I
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
think we have to be pretty smart I don't
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
mind being slow and steady but and and
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
not rush things but I'll look at that
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
specifically if that
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you like I said we do hear that
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
and and we know the process can be
 
00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:22.720 align:start position:0%
lengthy and uh this looks like it would
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
be in addition to the lengthy process it
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
already exists yes other uh
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
questions represent Simon actually
 
00:50:34.349 --> 00:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
question for the chair just for
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
clarification um because there are
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
people in the committee who have more
 
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
experience in this than I do um the 90
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
days how long does it usually take a
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
rule how how long is that process to get
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
to its completion and would the 90 days
 
00:50:50.109 --> 00:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
be an addition to or would it be just
 
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:51.720 align:start position:0%
kind of lost in the shuffle of how long
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
it typically takes space there are
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
specific time rules for for everything
 
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the rul making process most of them
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
like after considering the comment the
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
agency establishes the final text of the
 
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
rule and then file it no earlier than 21
 
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
days and no later than 180 days so that
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
if the process is they develop their
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
final rule write these explanations
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
then this this would be additive okay
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
because this might be more appropriate
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
for EXA session but into that if they
 
00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:29.960 align:start position:0%
have to ride that to jel car and then
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
jel car has to act there's actually more
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
time before the rule it's her thing is
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
when the rule goes into effect which is
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
not going to be till after jail Car Act
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
Right it seems like a lot of it maybe
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
all of it would be in parallel but it
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
would depend but I think the agency work
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
this would be in serious with their
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
rule so yeah except that they have to
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
present pretty much this information at
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
J car anyway don't they uh not in this
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
not as detail or something right but
 
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
anyway yes we'd have to look at it in
 
00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.510 align:start position:0%
anyway yes we'd have to look at it in
Greater

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
Greater
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
detail I love that you guys are talking
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to say that it was um
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
there was a comment this was not made to
 
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
prolong this was made to be in parallel
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
with the process so if this doesn't jive
 
00:52:25.829 --> 00:52:25.839 align:start position:0%
then um
 
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
then I'd be happy to make that change or
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
make it clear the one piece excuse me
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
you don't make the changes at this point
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
oh that's true you guys make the changes
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's true that's right just to save
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
you the bother of trying to do
 
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:42.520 align:start position:0%
it um the the other piece that has to do
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
with that is I'm looking at so from
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
where the rules making process
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
started um in my committee that we're
 
00:52:56.109 --> 00:52:56.119 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with I mean they were
 
00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:58.599 align:start position:0%
we were talking about this in the summer
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
um there were you know the official I
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the official process started
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
like in October and here we are uh in
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
February and then we've got another
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
meeting in March I mean we're that it's
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
a real it was a it's a real long process
 
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:18.040 align:start position:0%
so I know we're talking about a you
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
know major rules that we're that we're
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
dealing in regards with permitting um um
 
00:53:24.839 --> 00:53:25.670 align:start position:0%
dealing in regards with permitting um um
per

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
per
 
00:53:29.870 --> 00:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
landfill sighting but I don't know I I I
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
thought that it made sense in the scheme
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
of things but if it doesn't because this
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
needs to apply to all then you know
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
please make changes or let me know if I
 
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
need to look into something okay thank
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%

of you this which is a pictures of web
 
01:03:31.470 --> 01:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
pages and a little spreadsheet and an
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm going to start off if
 
01:03:37.309 --> 01:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
you if you go to this the pictures of
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
the web pages I'm going to go backwards
 
01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
here actually if you go to the second
 
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
page the third page
 
01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
technically it didn't come out very good
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
in copying there's three there's three
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
pictures here this is the visit nh.gov
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
website that the constituent tried to go
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
find the telephone number on um the top
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
picture is the when you first open the
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
web page up the very top picture the top
 
01:04:03.150 --> 01:04:03.160 align:start position:0%
third of the page it doesn't come it
 
01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:05.319 align:start position:0%
didn't come out very well uh there's no
 
01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:07.279 align:start position:0%
phone number it's a it's a nice picture
 
01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:09.279 align:start position:0%
and it says about uh Discovery in New
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire places that say ET
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
T if you scroll down and go to the very
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page you can see where I
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
made the arrow on the left and that
 
01:04:19.549 --> 01:04:19.559 align:start position:0%
there's a little tiny contact dust
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
button way down at the bottom of the
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
page when you open that at the very
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page the only thing you
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
get is that form that you fill out with
 
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
your name and email address you don't
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
get a telephone number you just that's
 
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
all you get so this is what kind of
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
prompted me to say this doesn't seem
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
very uh user friendly you can't even
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
find a phone number on there which is
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
what the constituent has
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
said um so I I took a look and if you go
 
01:04:47.109 --> 01:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
back to the first page we can go through
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
these um Department of Justice on front
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.710 align:start position:0%
these um Department of Justice on front
page

01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
there's an arrow on the top right you
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
can see they have contact by division
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
it's actually when you open it up it's
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
very very thorough and it's really good
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh the next one down a number of
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
websites have this type of an idea where
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
the contact us button I have an arrow
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
down there is way down in the bottom
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
left which it's it's obviously not uh
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
prioritized in that list be beyond all
 
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
the other things and page two kind of
 
01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
gives you the same
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
idea uh State Police there so on page
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
two you see the arrow their contact us
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
button you have to go to about us first
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
before you get to the contact us button
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
and the fuel assistance program weirdly
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
enough their contact us button is again
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page like others so
 
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
I thought this all seems very
 
01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.710 align:start position:0%
I thought this all seems very
inconsistent

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
and I said okay well I'll let me take a
 
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
look at every single agency's website
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
well I I abandoned that
 
01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:56.950 align:start position:0%
well I I abandoned that
idea

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
Well I this you don't have to look at
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet closely but this is as
 
01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
far as I got before I talked to
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
doit um so I just took a look and said
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
what's visible on the main page so my
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
idea is at least if you open the website
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
up when you first open it up you
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go hunting anywhere
 
01:06:16.269 --> 01:06:16.279 align:start position:0%
for a phone number so all of the ones
 
01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:18.200 align:start position:0%
that have an X in this very first column
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
did have that and the ones that didn't
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
did not have that and then I kep track
 
01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:23.839 align:start position:0%
of what they had inside the button which
 
01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
is not really it's it's too much
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
information for you but that's just how
 
01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I approached it um
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
so uh I I decided to make the same calls
 
01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:37.640 align:start position:0%
I made for the phone call to different
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
agencies to see what their take was on
 
01:06:44.069 --> 01:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
this and um I eventually ended up uh a
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
couple days ago talking to the
 
01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:47.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner of doit Department of
 
01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:48.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner of doit Department of
Information

01:06:48.470 --> 01:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
Information
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
Technology he told me
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
that the uh the standard they're working
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
on they have been given a standard web
 
01:07:01.470 --> 01:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
page designed by the governor's office
 
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
and they're working through getting all
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
of the web pages to match that standard
 
01:07:09.390 --> 01:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
web page design he said they're about
 
01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
73% of the way through if I or 75%
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
somewhere in there um it's a it's a slow
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
process of changing that um he said that
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
that standard web page the only
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
requirement for wear contact information
 
01:07:26.069 --> 01:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
is is at the bottom of the web page as
 
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
you saw in a couple of
 
01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
those um so that's kind of where that's
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
coming out of the governor's office he
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
also said if if I'm not misquoting what
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
he said that the governor is directly
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for changes to the standard
 
01:07:42.069 --> 01:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
web page design and whenever that comes
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
up he talks to the governor directly for
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
that so that's kind of the background of
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
where all this is at uh I have an you
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
have an amendment in front of
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
you that
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
um addressed a couple of the concerns
 
01:08:01.150 --> 01:08:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
agencies and if I can find my own copy
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
second too many papers as usual okay so
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
I I can quick run through the
 
01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendment one of the big pieces was I
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
deleted um B and E I think from the
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
original in line in part three hang on I
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
got to find the original here we go on
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
the original
 
01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill I'll take it from the top so it's
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
this says some
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
consistency um I added a definition in
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
for button because I kept using that
 
01:08:50.070 --> 01:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
word button and I wanted to make sure it
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
was clear what that meant um doit hasn't
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
looked at that yet they might have a a a
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
better definition for what that means so
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
that as I use that word throughout it
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
made some sense
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
um and I added on line 10 I added a
 
01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
standalone item at the top of the web
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
page as it so that it wasn't within
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
another menu or within another
 
01:09:13.759 --> 01:09:15.789 align:start position:0%
another menu or within another
button

01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
button
 
01:09:18.269 --> 01:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh and I put to direct the user to the
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
agency's contact information to be a
 
01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
little more clear and this button sh
 
01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
label contact contact us and after
 
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
talking to doit or other similar wording
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
which would readily indicate its purpose
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
so as Department of Justice says contact
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
by division I'm not 100% sure that I
 
01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:37.960 align:start position:0%
would think that's I would agree with
 
01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
that but it's I think it's
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
fine uh in in part
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
amendment which is part two in the
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
original bill I Chang contact or contact
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
us just to button so we we could we
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
didn't make them Define what it was
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
called and and then I put also in there
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
on line
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
15 to State the uniform design color and
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
size based upon the most recent webpage
 
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
design standards followed by doit that
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
means that this won't handcuff them if
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
the governor says I'd like to see it
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
done a little bit
 
01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:22.390 align:start position:0%
done a little bit
differently

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
10 is now 3A on the
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and I just wanted to draw your
 
01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
attention to this and I don't know no
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
nobody caught it nobody nobody commented
 
01:10:46.510 --> 01:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
to me about it messages on this
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
telephone line from the public will will
 
01:10:48.159 --> 01:10:48.910 align:start position:0%
telephone line from the public will will
be

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
monitored I had daily and I change that
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
to each state of New Hampshire business
 
01:10:55.229 --> 01:10:55.239 align:start position:0%
day to ensure a prompt
 
01:10:58.669 --> 01:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
response and then on the original Bill
 
01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
line 13 uh doit caught and and this
 
01:11:04.669 --> 01:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
could have been an OS translation of
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
what I originally wrote it said a direct
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
email link to the individual from the
 
01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
public directly to the appropriate
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
employee within the agency division or
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
Bureau that actually would make no sense
 
01:11:18.350 --> 01:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
to have a direct link to each
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
employee on the on the contact us button
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
so I I deleted that
 
01:11:26.669 --> 01:11:26.679 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
line line 13 deleted
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
that I left in um I didn't get any push
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
back on this I thought I might what's
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
line what's now line 22 formerly line uh
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
15 a direct link to the Govern the sorry
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
line 21 a direct link to the state of
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employee telephone
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
directory if you don't know that exists
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's amazing you should you should
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
check that out uh gives you every state
 
01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
employees phone number
 
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
basically uh
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
line and line 15 and 16 on the original
 
01:12:04.189 --> 01:12:04.199 align:start position:0%
stay the same I believe line 17 in the
 
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
deleted at the suggestion of the
 
01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner doit it said a direct link
 
01:12:14.110 --> 01:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
to all websites that exist for the
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
Department well that's that could be a
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
huge list obviously so and and they
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
every agency has other ways to go there
 
01:12:23.470 --> 01:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
within their website
 
01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:28.790 align:start position:0%
within their website
[Music]

01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
um and then the the commissioner of doit
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
said 60 days if you want me to do this
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
money he said within 36 I'm I wasn't
 
01:12:45.550 --> 01:12:45.560 align:start position:0%
trying to be funny I'm sorry within 365
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
days it would make sense that they could
 
01:12:49.149 --> 01:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
accomplish that maybe without funding
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
but if we want to make it go quicker we
 
01:12:55.149 --> 01:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
would have to to uh to fund some some uh
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
someone to do that and I think that's
 
01:12:59.229 --> 01:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
very fair so that's where I am in the
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's the idea of where
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going and so the basic idea is
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
following up on this morning if someone
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
wants to call the state you know
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about maybe some of our older
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
citizens aren't as good with the
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
computer um you should be able to go to
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
the when you open the website contact us
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's a phone number or or or as fact
 
01:13:24.669 --> 01:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
number or email that you can easily find
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.629 --> 01:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
questions represent Dolan thank you
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh thank you representative
 
01:13:37.709 --> 01:13:37.719 align:start position:0%
uh excellent work on this
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
uh question so as our technology screams
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
forward at the speed of light I'm
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that um very soon we're going
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
to be in a voice activated world uh
 
01:13:51.550 --> 01:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
everything appears that almost
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
everything you you've captured here is
 
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
push a
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
button is has any thought or input being
 
01:14:01.030 --> 01:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
thought to be given to the
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
state as they move forward to think
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
about voice activated uh access to to
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
the websites um that's a great point and
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
I hadn't had that conversation with
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
anyone and I'm sure that uh doit would
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
have some input on that and it could
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
be uh I could certainly talk them we
 
01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
be uh I could certainly talk them we
could

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
you could reward that as you thought it
 
01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
was as you thought it was fitting um but
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
point um I I I will follow up myself I
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
think um the commissioner at doit said
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
that he would have no problem with just
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
adding a a button to the top of web
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
pages without using this blunt
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
instrument of a law as as he thought and
 
01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's also Fair um uh
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner is here can and he will
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
speak for
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
himself hi hello have I said anything
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
you didn't say oh boy okay good well you
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
can you can speak to that yourself um so
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I I think we also had the
 
01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
conversation that uh as as this comes
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office I I did not
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
go to the governor's office and have
 
01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:17.400 align:start position:0%
that conversation with them so that
 
01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
might be a step to take as well okay
 
01:15:22.950 --> 01:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and seeing no other
 
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.030 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and seeing no other
questions

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:15:24.040 --> 01:15:35.590 align:start position:0%
questions
commissioner

01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
goule

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes uh good morning uh Madame chair
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um my name is
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
Dennis goule I am the commissioner of
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Information
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
Technology um I came here today to
 
01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
testify in favor of of this bill um you
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
know I I I really want to thank the
 
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:01.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor for for calling me and and
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
talking through uh because we you know
 
01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
that Amendment does address any concerns
 
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
that we have with the bill and you know
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
I think his point his main point that he
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
made to me which I thought was a good
 
01:16:14.629 --> 01:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
one is our standard template that um
 
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
that we're rolling out to all the
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
agencies and he was pretty close to
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
correct were about 72% through um had to
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
contact us in the bottom
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
part which is kind of standard but his
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
point was you know that's not very
 
01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
friendly you know up top right is better
 
01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:34.600 align:start position:0%
and you know I I would agree and some of
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
the agencies have chosen to put uh their
 
01:16:39.870 --> 01:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
contact us in the top right so I'm I'm
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine with doing that and um
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll we'll get on that I I think
 
01:16:47.629 --> 01:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that we do it as we
 
01:16:49.950 --> 01:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
move we're moving we have a a really
 
01:16:52.669 --> 01:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
nice new format that we use and and that
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
the all a we intend that all agencies
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
will be on we'll make it standard that
 
01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
the contact us be in the top right
 
01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
should um regardless whether this passes
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
or not and um and I think that's just
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
good it's good uh practice to make it
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
easier to get a hold of us we're happy
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
to place the a link to the employee
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
directory in there um and again the the
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
the line that was struck around you know
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
the you know kind of org chart of the of
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
the department in the contact us it
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
would make it kind of messy and hard to
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
absorb and it's it's different from what
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do which is to represent
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
our websites in terms of what what a
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
person going there might want to do
 
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
versus the or chart of the state so kind
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
of taking that you know abstracting it
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
out to what somebody might want to
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
accomplish by virtue of going to the
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
site and rather than oh here's a
 
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
department list so that was so I do
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsors flexibility on
 
01:17:52.629 --> 01:17:52.639 align:start position:0%
that and uh that's it for my tech uh my
 
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
test happy to answer any questions
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
represent man
 
01:17:59.629 --> 01:17:59.639 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair thank you uh
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question uh
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
how often do you update
 
01:18:09.629 --> 01:18:09.639 align:start position:0%
upgrade uh websites or
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
information digital information
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
public um great question um so one of
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
the things we do is I have a a a staff
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
of about three people that are
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for over 100 um executive
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
branch website properties so uh the vast
 
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
majority of all content updates happen
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
at the agency level and it really varies
 
01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:35.199 align:start position:0%
by agency but you know on the larger
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
agencies the content continually
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
changing um and and in fact uh HHS has
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
tens of people that are trained to
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
update content because they have so much
 
01:18:48.629 --> 01:18:48.639 align:start position:0%
of it and there's so much activity there
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
for example smaller agency may only have
 
01:18:53.189 --> 01:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
one person that updates contact uh
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
content on the website so so that that
 
01:18:59.070 --> 01:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
happens um based on the agency and and
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
their Staffing level and what their
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
business needs are uh so there's no one
 
01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh one answer to that okay represent
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
blackis thank you um could you send the
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
to the committee email uh if you have a
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
mockup image whatever of the template
 
01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
that you you're recommending for the
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
various Departments of what their the
 
01:19:19.390 --> 01:19:19.400 align:start position:0%
web pages should look like sure once we
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
get it U I think the Department of
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation is really close to what
 
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to you know they what they
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
have now is pretty I think is compliant
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
with this language so I'll I'll double
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
check that and we'll we'll point you at
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam Cher so morning
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner good morning I mean it
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
occurs to me that that we are undergoing
 
01:19:51.790 --> 01:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
a fundamental uh switch and change from
 
01:19:54.430 --> 01:19:54.440 align:start position:0%
a society where the
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
for decades ever since the telephone
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
became ver virtually uniform Universal I
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
meant to say in the country where you
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
first thing you did was you picked up
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
your telephone you dial the name of the
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
company and and you try to get a hold of
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
a person okay and those of us who are
 
01:20:17.639 --> 01:20:18.830 align:start position:0%
a person okay and those of us who are
longtime

01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
longtime
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
adults uh we've been trained by
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
the existence existing Society to do it
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
that way and relatively suddenly we are
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
in a different situation where that
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't work anymore very well because
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
companies do not want to have people
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
call them in my
 
01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
opinion because you got you have to have
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
a very elaborate Network to hand handle
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
a tremendous influx of requests for
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
information and help
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
right and now we have a situation where
 
01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
you have to look something up on a
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
website and so what is
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
the the degree of
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
uniformity if you could just tell us
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that currently because I'm sure you're
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
striving for much greater uniformity so
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
that when people look some something up
 
01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
as representative Brown has been doing
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
and and I go online and look stuff up
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
I'm sure most of us do and the first
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
thing we look for is how to get in touch
 
01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.310 align:start position:0%
thing we look for is how to get in touch
with

01:21:29.310 --> 01:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
somebody um but I I think that the web
 
01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
the websites web pages generally are
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get the people to find the
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
information on the web on the web page
 
01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
yes and your question is
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
so I you've been talking about this but
 
01:21:51.430 --> 01:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
where are we in terms of
 
01:21:54.430 --> 01:21:54.440 align:start position:0%
converting uh
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
the the the to the existing you've
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
already described in your testimony that
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh that it's being currently being done
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
agency by agency right that that is not
 
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
user friendly for the people it would be
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
much better to have uniformity so that
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
something there's always a first step
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
and and if it's going to be that contact
 
01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:23.629 align:start position:0%
and and if it's going to be that contact
button

01:22:23.629 --> 01:22:23.639 align:start position:0%
button
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh I predict that that
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
will uh that will not
 
01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:32.199 align:start position:0%
work but it will be be where people are
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
go commissioner um so I think what
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I I would tend to
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
agree I think step one was uniformity in
 
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
how we represent our agency websites to
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
me the next step would be you know
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
aggregating content in a way that was
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
not agency specific which is I think
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
what you just said in fact we have a
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
procurement out there right now for a
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
business services portal that we're
 
01:22:59.550 --> 01:22:59.560 align:start position:0%
doing a competitive procurement and that
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
would you know the vision there would be
 
01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
to take you know this business services
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
that could be delivered from multiple
 
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
agencies and house them in a single
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
place in an easy way and organize them
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
by business type or what they call Web
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
Geeks call it Persona I am I'm a car I'm
 
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
a car dealer at a titled person at Bley
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
Chevrolet have certain things I care
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
about that's what I should see when I go
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
there so I think that's what you're
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
talking about we don't have uh funding I
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
I'd love to U work on um a citizen
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
portal that was similar in other words
 
01:23:37.149 --> 01:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
you you have somebody coming in who's a
 
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
certain you know uh type of person and
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
then we present content to them that's
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
specific to them regardless of what
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
agency it's coming from that's a great
 
01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
vision some states are doing that many
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
are not we aren't yet but but it is a
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
good it would be a good good thing to do
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
and and we're starting on the business
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
side of that with that business services
 
01:23:59.790 --> 01:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
portal procurement um I I also wanted to
 
01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
answer the question from grip Dolan
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
around the the voice activated um we're
 
01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:06.280 align:start position:0%
going to one of the nice things about
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
our content platform now is it's it's
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
standards-based open source uh some
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
people care about that and um and um
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's changing as part of our service so
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
as as what's the norm evolves from a
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
website perspective I think it'll be
 
01:24:28.350 --> 01:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
pretty easy for us to adapt to that
 
01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.790 align:start position:0%
pretty easy for us to adapt to that
follow

01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
up a follow-up question thank you um so
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm experiencing
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
in my Outreach um um is uh a
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
portal concept we that word hasn't been
 
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:51.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned yet this morning I believe um
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
and the hospitals for example or health
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
care services they are many of them
 
01:24:59.790 --> 01:24:59.800 align:start position:0%
maybe all of them now I haven't been to
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
all of them thank God but but uh they
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
are they have a portals and and um the
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
Democratic office has a portal as well
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh so is that something that is kind of
 
01:25:14.669 --> 01:25:14.679 align:start position:0%
one of
 
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
the strategies you're already following
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that yes in fact um
 
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
that procurement that's out there now um
 
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're working with the Bea on that uh
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's the we call it the business
 
01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
services portal and that would be a
 
01:25:32.350 --> 01:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
place where um you know businesses we V
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
our vision is where business would go to
 
01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
have you know um content that they may
 
01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
care about without having to hunt it
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
down in an agency
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
website thank
 
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
you represent of gold thank you madam
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you commissioner for
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I understand
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
correctly what I'm hearing you say is
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
that you have three um employees who are
 
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
able to code or um handle things on for
 
01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
the website that basically are handling
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
the main
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
um Conformity across state agencies and
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
then within each agency there are people
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
who can manipulate data within that
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
agency to uh to keep it agency specific
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
for the variety that's needed to cover
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
their agency and then when there are big
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
projects like business portals or um I'm
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
sure that you could name us 500 L your
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
list of requests from the various
 
01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
agencies that are
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
prioritized um when those come in those
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
are contracted out thus the request if
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
you want something really complicated
 
01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost money is that correct
 
01:26:51.910 --> 01:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
yes it it it it's almost exactly correct
 
01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
in fact in fact as we're moving sites to
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
the new design structure one of the
 
01:26:59.590 --> 01:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
things we're suggesting is that agencies
 
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
go through that effort of identifying
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
Persona and then organizing their
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
content um around Persona which is a
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
non-trivial task it's not a technical
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
task it's a it's a Brute Force effort uh
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
but it it it it works really well and
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
you can see that reflected in some of
 
01:27:21.629 --> 01:27:21.639 align:start position:0%
the newer websites like if you were to
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
take a look Environmental Services or do
 
01:27:28.109 --> 01:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
or the education sites that those and U
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
or HHS some of the newer sites there
 
01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:33.679 align:start position:0%
they've they've invested in that um in
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller sites are relatively
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
simple there may only be one Persona so
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require that
 
01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
complexity um the that K bringing in
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
outside expertise to help with that can
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
can can be good because um not all
 
01:27:52.390 --> 01:27:52.400 align:start position:0%
humans are programmed to think think
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
like your customers so that's one of the
 
01:27:56.950 --> 01:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
things about that to do a good website
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
you really don't want to use your own
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
opinion about what's good or not you
 
01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
want to use the opinion of those folks
 
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
who are going to be accessing the
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
website to determine whether we're doing
 
01:28:07.830 --> 01:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
well or
 
01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.390 align:start position:0%
well or
not

01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
follow so getting back to this bill what
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
I think I hear you say is that if if the
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
intent here is simply which I would
 
01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
support 100% to make contact clear at
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
the top right hand corner that's
 
01:28:25.390 --> 01:28:25.400 align:start position:0%
something that your staff can do and
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
that'll translate on that main template
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
all across all agencies right and and
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked for more time is
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're working on the remaining 20
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
some percent of websites and if we made
 
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
that a standard it would come you know
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't cost anything extra we'd
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
just do it as part of transferring those
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
sites from their old format to the
 
01:28:53.070 --> 01:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
new thank you questions
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
MRA py thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
for taking another question I have two
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
part one is the content relevancy and
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
how quickly the content changes and also
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
with the communication interf phasing is
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
there a chat option that comes of how
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
can I help you kind of thing
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
um with the contact and communication
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
with the customers
 
01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
so um we uh agencies have experimented
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
with chat Bots which I think is what
 
01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:29.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking about we don't really have
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
any um broad deployment of that it
 
01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:34.360 align:start position:0%
actually takes a
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
um it's interesting it takes a different
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
psychology and it's just I think maybe
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
where you're getting at is to implement
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
a good chatbot is not it's not an FAQ
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
it's not question answer it has to have
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
some intelligence and you can't just
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
throw it out
 
01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
there you have to watch watch it
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
carefully and help it learn how to serve
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
our customers better so that's the
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
coaching I give to agencies who are
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
considering a chatbot is that they have
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
to assign people to to watching the
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
metrics watching how often it solves a
 
01:30:10.189 --> 01:30:10.199 align:start position:0%
problem or not and addressing those
 
01:30:12.510 --> 01:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
problems right away which is is is a
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
commitment um it it it it hearkens back
 
01:30:17.189 --> 01:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit to social media early days
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
of social media when when entities were
 
01:30:21.229 --> 01:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
putting up social media links they
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
weren't watching their own social media
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
link links which made them kind of nonv
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
valuable and even potentially harmful
 
01:30:30.109 --> 01:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
and and chats the same way so my
 
01:30:33.629 --> 01:30:33.639 align:start position:0%
coaching to agencies is chat chat bot
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
can be a really good thing as long as we
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
pay attention to it and it has been has
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
not been broadly adopted in the state
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
yet in the executive
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
branch thank you representative gold
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
thank you one last question uh
 
01:30:52.830 --> 01:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner So within the rated items
 
01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
of change requests that you have to the
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
system where would add a contact button
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the top right corner across all pages
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
fall in my priority list well um if it's
 
01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
fall in my priority list well um if it's
made

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
important um I it's already been made
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
important to me so I'm going to we're
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know I've talked to the folks that
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
run this and we're like oh yeah we can
 
01:31:18.229 --> 01:31:18.239 align:start position:0%
do that so it's it would be high in in
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
the priority list thank you
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
right seeing no further questions thank
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony thank you is
 
01:31:29.109 --> 01:31:29.119 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to testify
 
01:31:31.870 --> 01:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
1606 all right not seeing any I will
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing and open the
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.669 align:start position:0%
 
Corman

01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh for those who
 
01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't remember from 20 and one a half
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
hours ago I am Tom Corman uh I represent
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 which is Ward three of the
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
city of
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
Lebanon uh before I talk about the bill
 
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
I just want to give you a little
 
01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
background about myself to establish my
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
Bona fitas in the area as they were I am
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
an Emeritus professor of computer
 
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:23.719 align:start position:0%
science at Dartmouth College I was on
 
01:32:26.270 --> 01:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
the faculty there for 29 and a half
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
years I retired off cycle I chaired the
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
computer science department for six
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
years from
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
2019 uh excuse me 2009 to
 
01:32:40.350 --> 01:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
2015 I've been in computer science since
 
01:32:43.070 --> 01:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
1974 you don't need a computer to do the
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
math and realize that's 50 years so I've
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
been doing this stuff for a long time I
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
have uh eecs electrical engineering and
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
computer science degrees my undergrad
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
from Princeton a BSE and a master's in
 
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
PhD from
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
MIT I am actually best known as the lead
 
01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
author of a textbook called introduction
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
to algorithms it is a 1300 plus page
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
textbook on computer algorithms it is
 
01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
the standard computer algorithms
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
textbook in computer science it is the
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
best known book in all of computer
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
science we've sold over 1 million copies
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
of this worldwide in ious translations
 
01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
and I know for a fact that at least one
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
member of this committee owns a
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
copy that said I did not do research in
 
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
in artificial intelligence AI uh but I
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
had to keep up with developments in AI
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
in large part because as the chair of
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
the computer science department I needed
 
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
to keep up with the entire field and
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
understand what was going on and what I
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
do know is that AI has made astounding
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
progress in the last few years when I
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
was in graduate at school in the 1980s
 
01:33:55.629 --> 01:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
AI just seemed dead in the water the big
 
01:33:58.109 --> 01:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
thing was expert systems where you would
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
actually encode knowledge into a system
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
and then the system could answer
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
questions about it and it would be
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
really Arcane stuff for example there
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
was a system called cats and maybe with
 
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
a number it had nothing to do with cats
 
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
it was about locomotive repair so you
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
know doesn't get much more Arcane and
 
01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
locomotive repair but what we've seen in
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
the last few years is that we have what
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
are called Deep neural Nets neural Nets
 
01:34:24.109 --> 01:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
have been around for a long time but
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
people finally figured out how to use
 
01:34:28.030 --> 01:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
them and something called large language
 
01:34:30.229 --> 01:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
models where you're training these
 
01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
systems on a a huge Corpus possibly the
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
whole internet now I'm a quantitative
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
guy I know math I know what exponential
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
means and I know that people often
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
misuse exponential to mean fast growing
 
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
I know what exponential really means and
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
I think the progress in AI really has
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
been exponential it really has been
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
something something but there's a big
 
01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
concern which is bias in artificial
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
intelligence systems and that's due in
 
01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
large part to the bias in the data that
 
01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
the neural Nets are trained on whatever
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
data set you give there's going to be
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
some inherent bias so I'm really
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
concerned about Artificial Intelligence
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
impinging on our rights especially in
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the face of the the potential of biased
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
algorithms not just the potential but
 
01:35:22.030 --> 01:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
the reality of biased algorithms
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
so I drafted this bill hb1 1688 to
 
01:35:28.109 --> 01:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of granite Staters
 
01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
from AI systems now I modeled it on two
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation there's a lot of
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
legislation out there and if you get the
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
same new Fe news feeds I do you know
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that uh various states are looking at Ai
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
and in fact various committees in our
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
house are looking at bills related to
 
01:35:50.270 --> 01:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
AI I modeled this on legislation in
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and and also the European
 
01:35:56.350 --> 01:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
Union but I tailored it to New Hampshire
 
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:58.280 align:start position:0%
the bill is about protecting the rights
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
of granite Staters from AI systems used
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
by state agencies it places no
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
restrictions on anyone or anything else
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
including private Enterprise and the
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors if you look at the
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors they really represent a
 
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of political thought uh
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
because we all want to protect
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
everyone's rights the bill exempts
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
systems used by state funded
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
institutions of Higher Learning I have
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
friends at UNH and I don't want to
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing re research in
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
AI so it's not about research it's not
 
01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
about universities it's about the state
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
agencies uh and also it exempts any
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
systems in common personal use so uh one
 
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
of the things that the bill talks about
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
is facial recognition well if you're
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
using facial recognition to unlock your
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
smartphone that's not under the the bill
 
01:36:50.830 --> 01:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
right that's a personal system in common
 
01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
use that's it's not a state agency using
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
it for something so the bill defines uh
 
01:36:58.950 --> 01:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
three terms AI artificial int
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
intelligence generative Ai and deep
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
fakes so it defines AI as the ability of
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
a machine to display humanlike
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities for cognitive tasks such as
 
01:37:11.790 --> 01:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
reasoning learning planning and
 
01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
creativity and that AI can adapt Its
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
Behavior by analyzing the effects of
 
01:37:18.910 --> 01:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
previous actions and operating under
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
varying and unpredictable circumstan an
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
es without human oversight now I do want
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
to say that I've sent this bill out to
 
01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
various people and one of the people I
 
01:37:31.669 --> 01:37:31.679 align:start position:0%
sent it to is a man named Ronald revest
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
who's one of my co-authors on the
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
textbook he's also a touring Award
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
winner the touring award is like the
 
01:37:39.310 --> 01:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
Nobel Prize of computer science uh he
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
knows of stuff and he suggested uh maybe
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
say that they may adapt their behavior
 
01:37:46.709 --> 01:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
rather than they can adapt their
 
01:37:48.870 --> 01:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
behavior but what's I think really
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
important about the definition of AI
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
that I gave compared with where you see
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
it in other bills and other places is
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
that I've defined AI only in terms of
 
01:38:01.589 --> 01:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
behavior of the system not in terms of
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
its implementation you will see if you
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
look at bills from other states where
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
they talk about neural Nets and training
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not defining it that way I'm just
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
saying it's systems that behave in a
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
certain way regardless of how they're
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
implemented because implementations are
 
01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
going to change over time generative AI
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
is AI that can generate text images or
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
other media in response to prompts um
 
01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.229 align:start position:0%
other media in response to prompts um
chat

01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:25.239 align:start position:0%
chat
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
GPT um uh Dolly things like that and a
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
deep fake uh the bill defines as a video
 
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
in which a person's face or body is
 
01:38:34.990 --> 01:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
digitally altered so that they appear to
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
be someone else saying something they
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
never said or doing something that they
 
01:38:42.589 --> 01:38:42.599 align:start position:0%
never did and I realize uh oh and it
 
01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:44.679 align:start position:0%
it's typically used maliciously or to
 
01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
spread false information but not always
 
01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I could imagine you know we
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
put out a PSA of Abraham Lincoln talking
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
about preventing forest fires or
 
01:38:54.750 --> 01:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
something like that but typically
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're used maliciously and actually as
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
I think about it uh the the bill
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
actually says video but it could apply
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
to any media right for example um as we
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
all know Joe Biden didn't really call up
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
people and say to not vote on primary
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
day and that wasn't video that was
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
audio so the bill has prohibited uses by
 
01:39:18.270 --> 01:39:18.280 align:start position:0%
state agencies and these are drawn again
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
from the Connecticut bill and the EU
 
01:39:20.159 --> 01:39:21.629 align:start position:0%
from the Connecticut bill and the EU
restrictions

01:39:21.629 --> 01:39:21.639 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh so the first thing that's listed is
 
01:39:26.550 --> 01:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral manipulation now I
 
01:39:29.589 --> 01:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
heard from uh commissioner goule of the
 
01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
state it a uh Department yesterday that
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
there may be cases where we do want
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
cognitive behavioral manipulation and he
 
01:39:40.589 --> 01:39:40.599 align:start position:0%
gave a great example of a uh a veteran
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
calling a a helpline and the helpline
 
01:39:45.470 --> 01:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
actually directs the veteran to the
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
right place using AI so I can imagine
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
making some sort of amendment uh for
 
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:53.320 align:start position:0%
that that or maybe removing it uh
 
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:55.480 align:start position:0%
classifying People based on Behavior
 
01:39:57.709 --> 01:39:57.719 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic status or personal
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
characteristics resulting in unlawful
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
discrimination or disperate impact based
 
01:40:04.830 --> 01:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
on actual or perceived
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
characteristics real time and remote
 
01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
biometric identification for public
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
surveillance such as facial recognition
 
01:40:13.629 --> 01:40:13.639 align:start position:0%
and the bill has an exception for
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
locating a missing or abducted person
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
and again uh commissioner goule gave me
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
another case where we actually might
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to use surveillance and uh imagine
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
a school shooting where we want to
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
actually figure out where the shooter is
 
01:40:29.669 --> 01:40:29.679 align:start position:0%
so again I can imagine um a another
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
restriction on that and then deep fakes
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
when used for any deceptive or malicious
 
01:40:37.629 --> 01:40:37.639 align:start position:0%
purpose so those would be prohibited and
 
01:40:39.510 --> 01:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
then the bill has uses that are
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
permitted but with
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
restrictions if an AI system produces a
 
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation or a decision that once
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
you execute you can't undo it then there
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
must be an appropriate human in the loop
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
and an example that I think of is
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
imagine a hostage situation and the
 
01:41:00.790 --> 01:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
state police send in a robot the robot
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
does not decide what to do right if the
 
01:41:05.669 --> 01:41:05.679 align:start position:0%
robot shoots someone there's no way to
 
01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
unsho them so I would want an
 
01:41:11.950 --> 01:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate human in the loop um other
 
01:41:14.270 --> 01:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
examples when rights and freedoms of an
 
01:41:16.830 --> 01:41:16.840 align:start position:0%
individual are determined uh again this
 
01:41:18.510 --> 01:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
is where there has to be a human in the
 
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
loop uh biometric identification
 
01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:24.040 align:start position:0%
to verify identity management and
 
01:41:26.669 --> 01:41:26.679 align:start position:0%
operation of critical infrastructure
 
01:41:29.229 --> 01:41:29.239 align:start position:0%
state and local law enforcement actions
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
and interpreting and applying laws
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
including sentencing and we know that
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
elsewhere AI has proven biased in s
 
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
sentencing so sentencing should not be
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
done only by AI the bill also says that
 
01:41:45.390 --> 01:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
if you have material produced by
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
generative AI without a human in the
 
01:41:50.350 --> 01:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
loop that must be disclosed as generated
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
by AI I and that whenever a human is
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
interacting with AI directly or
 
01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:56.440 align:start position:0%
indirectly they must be told that they
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
are you need to know if you're
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
interacting with AI rather than a
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
person the bill also has a section on
 
01:42:05.550 --> 01:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
compliance uh it says that within nine
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
months of the effective date All State
 
01:42:09.750 --> 01:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
agencies must report compliance to the
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
reviewing Ai and systems to verify
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
compliance removing any AI not in
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
compliance and modifying all procedures
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
relative to AOG
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
sorry modifying um all procedures
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
relative to AI as um as needed to be in
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
compliance and any new AI systems need
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
to comply and one year after the
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
effective date of the ACT uh the
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
department of it would produce a report
 
01:42:41.950 --> 01:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
summarizing what state agencies have
 
01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:43.400 align:start position:0%
done with
 
01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.990 align:start position:0%
done with
AI

01:42:44.990 --> 01:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
AI
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
now one question that I hope is in your
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
mind is why a bill for this why why
 
01:42:54.750 --> 01:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
can't we do this with what we have the
 
01:42:56.990 --> 01:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Information Technology
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
already has New Hampshire state
 
01:43:00.990 --> 01:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
government code of ethics for the use
 
01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
and development of generative artificial
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
intelligence and automated decision
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
systems and it does overlap with uh some
 
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
of the areas in the bill but the bill
 
01:43:11.790 --> 01:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
goes beyond that but the main thing is
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
this the bill is about rights it's about
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
our rights and our citizens rights it
 
01:43:21.589 --> 01:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
should be enshrined in statute not just
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules administrative
 
01:43:26.030 --> 01:43:26.040 align:start position:0%
rules can change quickly or when a new
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
Administration comes in so I really feel
 
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:31.400 align:start position:0%
like whatever rights we want to have to
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens from AI should be
 
01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.270 align:start position:0%
protect our citizens from AI should be
in

01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
statute uh so there are other suggested
 
01:43:41.109 --> 01:43:41.119 align:start position:0%
changes that I've heard from people and
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the main thing is I'm happy to work
 
01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
with the committee or subcommittee and
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
with agencies on any amendments to
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
improve the bill it's not an early bill
 
01:43:52.589 --> 01:43:52.599 align:start position:0%
so we do have have some time to work on
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
it and with that I'm happy to take
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent Dolan and
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
then Schmidt and man goody thank you
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you representative
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh my my concern is specifically about
 
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
election interference and you mentioned
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
one with President Biden was a victim of
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh of some already uh my question
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
is uh have you intersected with our
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee on Election law that's also
 
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
working on some bills on AI and has they
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
how they relate to elections thank you
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm actually a co-sponsor on that
 
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
bill that representative Brennan has has
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor for and actually I
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
know of bills in at least four
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
committees related to AI um so what one
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the things that we need to do is is
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
look at at AI holistically take a a
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
broader view of AI rather than committee
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
by committee and I've actually spoken
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
with chairman Roy of Criminal Justice
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety about that and there
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
may be something that we can do but I
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't know that that's going to happen
 
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
anytime soon so I think for now we're
 
01:45:05.589 --> 01:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
going to have to go with this peacemeal
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
approach committee by committee but
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
you're right we do need for example a
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
standard definition of AI in statute not
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
RSA by
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
RSA follow up follow up uh committee
 
01:45:24.589 --> 01:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
chair Perry has is is has that that
 
01:45:26.589 --> 01:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
other bill in the election law just as a
 
01:45:28.109 --> 01:45:28.119 align:start position:0%
point of reference that if you want to
 
01:45:29.550 --> 01:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
talk to him about it thank you madam
 
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you representative
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so
 
01:45:38.430 --> 01:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
question number one of the chair is this
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee if we think it needs it yes
 
01:45:46.910 --> 01:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
I it's up to
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
me this is a dipping our toe into the
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
Atlantic ocean instead of just the
 
01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
bathtub um so probably yes yeah thank
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
you uh Professor Corman if I may so uh
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
the thing is um is there a component in
 
01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
your bill setting up a study committee
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
because th this really
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
is getting into a whole Terror
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
incognit the bill that I submitted does
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
not set up a study committee um I spoke
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
with chairman Roy
 
01:46:26.229 --> 01:46:26.239 align:start position:0%
about a study committee one one of the
 
01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
things he had suggested was that uh the
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
speaker set up a special committee on AI
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
and apparently speaker is not interested
 
01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:35.599 align:start position:0%
in doing that at this time so another
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to take a bill that's
 
01:46:40.589 --> 01:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
currently in committee somewhere and
 
01:46:43.709 --> 01:46:43.719 align:start position:0%
have it set up uh a study commission not
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
just a committee but a commission that
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
would have experts from outside the
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
legislature we certainly have plenty of
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
people people within the state who are
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable about AI than any of
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
us in the building here uh so that would
 
01:46:58.470 --> 01:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
be one possibility but my bill doesn't
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
do that just a quick follow so we you
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
you could submit an amendment to this
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill that would that would establish
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
such a study committee we we could do
 
01:47:12.750 --> 01:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
that I know there's also a bill in
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
judiciary uh that that is about Ai and
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary maybe doing something like
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
that so what I think we need to do if if
 
01:47:21.629 --> 01:47:21.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that we need to make
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we're Co coordinating among
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
the Committees to make sure that we
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
don't have five bills that are setting
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
up a
 
01:47:30.589 --> 01:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
commission yes thank you for that
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
thought representative maputi thank you
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh very specific to system
 
01:47:41.149 --> 01:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
approach to computer in computer
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
technology field things change very
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
rapidly right it used to be twoe cycle
 
01:47:50.350 --> 01:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
and six month cycle now two week cycle
 
01:47:54.669 --> 01:47:54.679 align:start position:0%
kind of thing so how far
 
01:47:58.830 --> 01:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
behind is the entire computer system in
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
the state that are all the Departments
 
01:48:05.830 --> 01:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
connected with the same technology
 
01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:09.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's needed to handle
 
01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:10.669 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that's needed to handle
this

01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:13.000 align:start position:0%
leap representative I
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
think commissioner gulay might be a
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
better person to answer that question to
 
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
be honest with you right but I I I I
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
will say that um the way the bill is
 
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
written it's really technology
 
01:48:27.950 --> 01:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
independent that that's why I was very
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
careful to craft it to define AI in
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
terms of behavior rather than technology
 
01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.270 align:start position:0%
terms of behavior rather than technology
or

01:48:34.270 --> 01:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
implementation uh I I will also say that
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
we had a bill last year that would have
 
01:48:44.030 --> 01:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
set up a uh a it would have said that
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
the uh there's there is an IT Advisory
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
Board I believe and they meet twice a
 
01:48:51.790 --> 01:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
year and it would have had them looking
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
at Ai and that came to to my committee
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy and uh we
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
recommended itl on that bill and it was
 
01:49:02.830 --> 01:49:02.840 align:start position:0%
ited um because with things moving so
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
fast that that Council or or or board
 
01:49:09.589 --> 01:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
meets only twice a year which isn't fast
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
enough okay representative broa thank
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
you I have a comment to the chair um I
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
think this bill is Well written I don't
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
believe it needs to go to committee but
 
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:22.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to do that that's your
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
prerogative I just think he needs a
 
01:49:24.199 --> 01:49:25.229 align:start position:0%
prerogative I just think he needs a
couple

01:49:25.229 --> 01:49:25.239 align:start position:0%
couple
 
01:49:28.589 --> 01:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
of you know fixes that um representative
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
Corman rep um recommended to us and I'll
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
be glad to take that on if you wish
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you we will we've got two other
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
people who wish to speak so we'll see
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
what they have to say about
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
it okay other questions thank you very
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.119 --> 01:50:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
Maguire

01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Madam chair and
 
01:50:06.189 --> 01:50:06.199 align:start position:0%
Happy Valentine's Day to you and the
 
01:50:09.310 --> 01:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee um as you as you
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
may recall I represent the town of
 
01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:15.400 align:start position:0%
Epsom and uh while I'm not quite as
 
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
accomplished as representative Corman I
 
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
too uh received the PhD in computer
 
01:50:25.229 --> 01:50:25.239 align:start position:0%
science from MIT 30 plus years
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
ago and um I'm happy to be a co-sponsor
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill um you know despite my
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
background I've never been what you
 
01:50:36.270 --> 01:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
might call an early
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
adopter I I tend to have a go slow
 
01:50:41.550 --> 01:50:41.560 align:start position:0%
approach to technology and that's sort
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
of how I see this bill as telling the
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
state you know let's go slow and be
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
careful uh we got something new here
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
we don't have to be way out in front we
 
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:56.440 align:start position:0%
can we can be slow we can be thoughtful
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
and so on um I think the key part of the
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
bill is um on the first page line
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
24 the prohibition
 
01:51:10.629 --> 01:51:10.639 align:start position:0%
section um uh representative Corman
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
already talked about the first one
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral um manipulation that might
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
need slight um slight Amendment to sort
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
of informational purposes and and
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
possibly therapeutic
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
purposes um but the one that I think is
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
key is on the second page number Roman
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
three um surveillance type of stuff and
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
so I think that's very much in line with
 
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
our latest uh change to the Constitution
 
01:51:46.069 --> 01:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
regarding privacy um I I think I think
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
that's excellent and obviously number
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
five uh deceptive and malicious stuff
 
01:51:54.750 --> 01:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
you know that that's very important um
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
in general I would assume or you know I
 
01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised to learn if the
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
state is in violation of any of these
 
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
things currently right so so I think I
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
think this is kind of ahead of the curve
 
01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
this is just to make sure we don't
 
01:52:13.109 --> 01:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
accidentally kind of step off the off
 
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
the edge and into these kind of things
 
01:52:17.430 --> 01:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
but I I would assume that you know it's
 
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
it's be relatively quick to to discover
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
you know to just to you know determine
 
01:52:27.709 --> 01:52:27.719 align:start position:0%
that we're not in in violation here um
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
and if so to to clean up those one or
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
two small cases but I'm happy to answer
 
01:52:38.270 --> 01:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
questions Schmid thank you madam
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
chair uh so your statement you don't
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
think that the state is probably in
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
violation but how about private entities
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
and should we not be thinking about that
 
01:52:51.189 --> 01:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
as well thank you for the question
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative this bill does not as as
 
01:52:55.629 --> 01:52:55.639 align:start position:0%
representative Corman said this bill is
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
not about private action this is
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
actions question follow up well that's
 
01:53:08.830 --> 01:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
my question if if it's much more it
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
would be certainly pernicious if the
 
01:53:14.270 --> 01:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
state were yeah heavy-handedly involved
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
but to the degree that private entities
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
um are are almost certainly doing that
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
already uh should we not be mindful of
 
01:53:27.750 --> 01:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
some way of getting at that yeah all
 
01:53:30.149 --> 01:53:30.159 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question so in
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
general I would say no um because I
 
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
think we already have sort of General
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
Provisions for example on um uh the
 
01:53:43.870 --> 01:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
first page line 26 classifying People
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
based on Behavior Etc notice that that
 
01:53:49.229 --> 01:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
sub paragraph A and B both start with
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
the word unlawful so we already have
 
01:53:54.669 --> 01:53:54.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions that people can't un
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
unlawfully discriminate based on you
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
know the the laundry list of of
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
characteristics so um so the answer is
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
is sort of to me is no I think let's
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
start with this and and sort of see how
 
01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:10.589 align:start position:0%
start with this and and sort of see how
it

01:54:10.589 --> 01:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
goes other
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative gold has a
 
01:54:20.350 --> 01:54:20.360 align:start position:0%
question just one quick one a little
 
01:54:23.229 --> 01:54:23.239 align:start position:0%
concerned about a peac meal
 
01:54:25.430 --> 01:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
approach and I want to thank all of you
 
01:54:27.270 --> 01:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
for bringing this to our attention
 
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
because this is huge and it's important
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
and I love getting ahead of the
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
eightball but I'm not convinced we are
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
ahead of it but um my question has to do
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
with do you think that one bigger
 
01:54:45.589 --> 01:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
centralized approach I would serve the
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
state better than a peace meal approach
 
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for the question so I
 
01:54:52.990 --> 01:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
think you have in mind you know a
 
01:54:56.109 --> 01:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
director of AI or something of that sort
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
maybe um so no I I guess I don't think
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
so I I really like I agree with
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative groa that this is a very
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
well-written bill I think uh
 
01:55:08.510 --> 01:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Corman did a very careful
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
simple but my question had to do with
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
the possibility there was talk that they
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
were like four other bills and we could
 
01:55:25.149 --> 01:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
have four different peac meal bills
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
happening um thank you for the question
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm only personally familiar with
 
01:55:32.109 --> 01:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
one of them there's a bill in election
 
01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
law uh to pre which I am also a
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of which is to prevent
 
01:55:40.589 --> 01:55:40.599 align:start position:0%
deceptive advertising so similar to that
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
um Roman 4 but but in the in the realm
 
01:55:46.629 --> 01:55:46.639 align:start position:0%
of political advertising
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
so I again I think that this bill is is
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
strictly about um State actions right
 
01:55:56.790 --> 01:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
things that the state would do on its
 
01:55:59.790 --> 01:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
own whereas these other bills have more
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
to do with the the the public and and
 
01:56:04.990 --> 01:56:05.000 align:start position:0%
the political Arena and so on so it's
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to have more than one I
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's that bad okay anyone
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
else thank you very much for your
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
testimony director
 
01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
gay commissioner GLE
 
01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:34.870 align:start position:0%
gay commissioner GLE
sorry

01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
good morning again uh Madam chair
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Dennis goule
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for the Department of
 
01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.189 align:start position:0%
the commissioner for the Department of
Information

01:56:42.189 --> 01:56:42.199 align:start position:0%
Information
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
Technology um I'm here today to uh
 
01:56:47.510 --> 01:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
testify in opposition to this bill I'll
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll explain that as I as as I go
 
01:56:53.069 --> 01:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
uh but first of all I I want to say that
 
01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
um I think U representative Corman and
 
01:56:59.310 --> 01:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
myself share passion for for doing AI
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
correctly um it's one of the reasons why
 
01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire was one of
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
the very first states in the union to
 
01:57:07.629 --> 01:57:07.639 align:start position:0%
have a code of ethics which is passing
 
01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
around and and a policy for agencies to
 
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.109 align:start position:0%
around and and a policy for agencies to
to

01:57:12.109 --> 01:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
follow um I'll I'll take uh a couple of
 
01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
a moment to to talk about a couple
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
things first I think the the compliance
 
01:57:24.510 --> 01:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
section is is not feasible to implement
 
01:57:27.629 --> 01:57:27.639 align:start position:0%
or enforce uh the the executive branch
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
is running hundreds of application
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
Solutions many of the vendors are adding
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
AI capabilities right now as we speak to
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
their platforms and despite that we're
 
01:57:40.750 --> 01:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no impetus to transgress our AI
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
our existing code of ethics or policies
 
01:57:47.069 --> 01:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
on the behalf of the agencies in fact
 
01:57:49.069 --> 01:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing from a our agency
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
partner Partners is they're coming to us
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
and asking about things they're saying
 
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
well you know what we're thinking about
 
01:57:56.109 --> 01:57:56.119 align:start position:0%
AI what should we be doing and that's
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
part of how we came up with the we were
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
talking earlier about the chatbots and
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
how you do that appropriately well a lot
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
of the chatbot technology is using you
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
know generative AI
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
capabilities um so really I'm I'm not
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
really expecting to have a problem here
 
01:58:19.069 --> 01:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
um the uh and the the other thing is is
 
01:58:19.079 --> 01:58:20.310 align:start position:0%
um the uh and the the other thing is is
the

01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh that rep Corman talked about you know
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
the speed at which we have to adapt
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things I like about
 
01:58:29.229 --> 01:58:29.239 align:start position:0%
having the policy no sooner did I did we
 
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
publish this policy that I found a flaw
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
in it and we quickly corrected it and uh
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
so uh it's one of the things that is
 
01:58:42.589 --> 01:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
nice about H doing it this way um as
 
01:58:44.550 --> 01:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out and as I shared with the
 
01:58:49.510 --> 01:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor um the some of the language is
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
is prescribing things that could be good
 
01:58:54.270 --> 01:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
you know we have the example of somebody
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
who's who's coming on to a suicide
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
hotline chatbot we're trying to
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
influence their behavior we're trying to
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that they do the right thing
 
01:59:05.510 --> 01:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
for themselves and their loved ones um
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is that the uh
 
01:59:09.629 --> 01:59:09.639 align:start position:0%
particularly on the facial recognition
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
side um that's you know for um the
 
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
Departments of safety and and and
 
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
Corrections that can be a strong Public
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
Safety tool that we can use and and I
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
I'd hate to see that not be allowed um
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is it's missing
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
important things like one of the AI
 
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
algorithms can't do anything without
 
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
data data is what educates them to
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
actually generate some sort some form of
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
artificial intelligence and so
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
protecting the Citizen's
 
01:59:49.189 --> 01:59:49.199 align:start position:0%
data is you the data that we're char
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
charged with holding is is an important
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
part of what we need to be doing so
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why we have
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
Provisions in our in our contract
 
01:59:58.430 --> 01:59:58.440 align:start position:0%
language templates that that talk about
 
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
the you know not um using our data for
 
02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
purposes outside of the the state of New
 
02:00:07.629 --> 02:00:07.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what we're what we're um um
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
what we're purchasing that technology
 
02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
for there would be a strong motivation
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
for technology vendors to want to gather
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
more and more data because that will
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
educate their Ai and make it work better
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
we don't want that as it relates to
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire data so there's a
 
02:00:26.189 --> 02:00:26.199 align:start position:0%
piece missing as well and and that
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
really leads me to uh my my final
 
02:00:32.030 --> 02:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion and and I think you know
 
02:00:34.109 --> 02:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
there may be a time when we need AI to
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
to regulate state
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
agencies um I don't feel like we're
 
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
there at this point um for reasons I
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned before but but but also um I'd
 
02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
like to I'd like to feel like i' I've
 
02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
been following this in watching this and
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
feel pretty well educated and I still
 
02:00:54.069 --> 02:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
feel like we're learning stuff really
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
rapidly and I'd want to have the ability
 
02:00:59.350 --> 02:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
to adapt quickly and not have to wait
 
02:01:02.390 --> 02:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
for a legislative session to change what
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
AI first and of leus and then M thank
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
you um
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
so I you know obviously haven't had a
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
chance to read the documents he handed
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
out but if they they are very good then
 
02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
I would expect that there's not a
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
problem we're not going to be in
 
02:01:32.589 --> 02:01:32.599 align:start position:0%
conflict with it I'm just going to so I
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
don't know so the question is why do you
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
feel that you know you need to oppose
 
02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:37.229 align:start position:0%
feel that you know you need to oppose
this

02:01:37.229 --> 02:01:37.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:40.229 --> 02:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
bill and related to that questions about
 
02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
why You' oppose it um I know there's
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about privacy and and having
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
this expanded law enforcement is a big
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
concern and there's there are probably
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
going to be an amendment to some of the
 
02:01:54.629 --> 02:01:54.639 align:start position:0%
things that that you talked about but um
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
if you'd respond to that sure I think
 
02:02:00.669 --> 02:02:00.679 align:start position:0%
the speed to adapt is my my largest
 
02:02:05.350 --> 02:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
thing right now is um the uh you know
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
having the ability to if we discover
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
that there's flaws in how we're thinking
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
about Ai and regulating it inside the
 
02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
state then I'd like to be a little doubt
 
02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
quickly followup followup um but I mean
 
02:02:21.390 --> 02:02:21.400 align:start position:0%
what makees sense to
 
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
um you as as one of the speakers before
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
said you know slow things down um put a
 
02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
um and and think about this carefully
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
because if we done this path there there
 
02:02:34.310 --> 02:02:34.320 align:start position:0%
could be problems and you wanted to you
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
had some things you said about um you
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
know protecting information all that but
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything in the bill that
 
02:02:43.270 --> 02:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
would prevent you from doing that is am
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
I incorrect no the I think the main
 
02:02:46.669 --> 02:02:46.679 align:start position:0%
point there
 
02:02:50.189 --> 02:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
was arguing that I don't think we know
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
as much as we need to know to to um
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
regulate Ai and statute yet but I would
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
ha I'd be happy to collaborate with the
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
committee or subcommittee or or study
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
committee if if we want to go that that
 
02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
way and kind of work on it uh but all
 
02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you represent man py thank
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you uh director
 
02:03:14.910 --> 02:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question have to part in
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
terms of when web page became a central
 
02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:20.229 align:start position:0%
terms of when web page became a central
piece

02:03:20.229 --> 02:03:20.239 align:start position:0%
piece
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
and the ethics and code of ethics and
 
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:26.800 align:start position:0%
how to manage when you put up a web P
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
web safety all those things were
 
02:03:31.629 --> 02:03:31.639 align:start position:0%
critical piece
 
02:03:35.629 --> 02:03:35.639 align:start position:0%
when uh Society transitioned to web page
 
02:03:39.310 --> 02:03:39.320 align:start position:0%
are we not there for AI at this point if
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
we wait we have to have the ethics and
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure whether we are ready or
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
not the train is in the station if you
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
get on the train or not it's going to go
 
02:03:56.430 --> 02:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
so does that make the
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
re reason that we have to address it now
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
technology is
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
here yes yes and and and I feel like we
 
02:04:09.149 --> 02:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
are addressing it um we're we're
 
02:04:10.950 --> 02:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
actively engaging with the agencies that
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
are thinking about using AI technology
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we're looking we're looking to guide
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
them in the appropriate use of that
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
and through our through our policies um
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
and I agree the train has is very
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly leaving the station as I
 
02:04:28.510 --> 02:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
testified before if you look at the
 
02:04:30.310 --> 02:04:30.320 align:start position:0%
major software platforms that we're
 
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
running in the state or about to run all
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
of them are adding AI capabilities and
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
most of them are actually doing their
 
02:04:40.149 --> 02:04:40.159 align:start position:0%
own codes of Ethics because a for
 
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
software companies or or technology
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
platform companies in for for the most
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
part they're it's not going to be in
 
02:04:49.950 --> 02:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
their interest for for their customers
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
to misuse that technology will just
 
02:04:54.030 --> 02:04:54.040 align:start position:0%
reflect badly on them so we're seeing
 
02:04:56.549 --> 02:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
our major technology Partners bringing
 
02:04:58.549 --> 02:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
in their customers and saying here's
 
02:05:01.870 --> 02:05:01.880 align:start position:0%
what our AI code of ethics is and you
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
know it's it's baby steps for them and I
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't trust them to do
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
everything we need to do but that is
 
02:05:10.750 --> 02:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
happening as well glad to know there are
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
some baby steps representative Schmidt
 
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then thank you madam chair so uh
 
02:05:18.910 --> 02:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
could you be more specific in your
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
opposition is it that this bill is
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrongheaded uh going in
 
02:05:26.430 --> 02:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction or is it flawed and
 
02:05:28.629 --> 02:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
it needs some fixes that you could help
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
us with no I think I I think the
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
sponsors and I are mostly in agreement I
 
02:05:34.910 --> 02:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
think it's more of for for me it's a
 
02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.189 align:start position:0%
think it's more of for for me it's a
timing

02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
timing
 
02:05:39.790 --> 02:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative laus um
 
02:05:41.310 --> 02:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if you can understand
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
or you have a you know some comment on
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
the idea that the the fact that um the
 
02:05:49.629 --> 02:05:49.639 align:start position:0%
platform vendors are adding AI
 
02:05:52.549 --> 02:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
um generates I think a serious concern
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
and uh is something that uh we should
 
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
breaks put the brakes on and the
 
02:05:58.870 --> 02:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislature needs to oversee how this
 
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
stuff is added I mean I was a little you
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
know anyway so is there some reason why
 
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable no I mean it's your
 
02:06:10.030 --> 02:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
prerogative and I I respect that
 
02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
prerogative um I would argue that we
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
are we are acting in your interest and
 
02:06:18.950 --> 02:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
in the citizens interest already um but
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
but you may not agree with that and and
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
again that's your prerogative thank you
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative Simon and then goalie
 
02:06:28.390 --> 02:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you for
 
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question um and I would start
 
02:06:32.750 --> 02:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
by saying I'm not sure that anybody
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
questions whether you're keeping our
 
02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:37.320 align:start position:0%
best interest at heart um I think the
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
question that keeps coming to my mind as
 
02:06:41.030 --> 02:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh I'm listening to my colleagues
 
02:06:43.350 --> 02:06:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions and your answers to them um
 
02:06:45.069 --> 02:06:45.079 align:start position:0%
there are obviously a few components
 
02:06:47.470 --> 02:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
that are of concern as mentioned um the
 
02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee is interested in in amending
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
those things to address those concerns
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
outside of those specific concerns
 
02:06:56.109 --> 02:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
however I guess but at least I haven't
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
understood or haven't heard from you um
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
what about this document do you think
 
02:07:04.430 --> 02:07:04.440 align:start position:0%
would slow or impede your ability to
 
02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
address issues in the future what about
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
this would slow you down outside of
 
02:07:11.109 --> 02:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
those because I I I'm personally not
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
seeing it okay I well I'm not seeing it
 
02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
either I just I I what when we what I
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
the history of of my what I've seen as
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
we've approached things like cyber
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
security for example um years ago when I
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
joined the state um we uh did an
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
executive order on cyber security and we
 
02:07:34.149 --> 02:07:34.159 align:start position:0%
thought about asking for legislation and
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
we thought oh um we don't understand it
 
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
that well yet so let's do an EO and then
 
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
put the things that are important that
 
02:07:45.149 --> 02:07:45.159 align:start position:0%
we learn in statute so what we learned
 
02:07:46.990 --> 02:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
is some of the stuff we assumed were was
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
correct in the executive order was was
 
02:07:52.189 --> 02:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
and some was not and we've added things
 
02:07:54.589 --> 02:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
to statute since then in a thoughtful
 
02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
way that has helped us a lot with the
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
state's cyber security posture so I'm
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
not saying I know of things that but in
 
02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
particular if there's language and
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
statute that would preclude us from
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
adapting to things we learn um it would
 
02:08:15.149 --> 02:08:15.159 align:start position:0%
be you know that it's it's another cycle
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.669 align:start position:0%
to get that
corrected

02:08:19.669 --> 02:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
02:08:21.069 --> 02:08:21.079 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure that I'm clear it
 
02:08:23.229 --> 02:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
seemed clear but you're saying you can't
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
see anything specifically wrong with
 
02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill at the moment but we just
 
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what we so if we worked on
 
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
amendments and passed this um I don't it
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would harm the state in
 
02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
the short term we just you know I feel
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
like that the Train's left the station
 
02:08:43.069 --> 02:08:43.079 align:start position:0%
it is moving at exceptionally
 
02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
fastpac and um I I have this niggling
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
concern that that you know we could put
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
language in in statute that may um cause
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
us to not be able to adapt quickly
 
02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.030 align:start position:0%
us to not be able to adapt quickly
enough

02:08:56.030 --> 02:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:08:58.990 --> 02:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's all okay thank you
 
02:09:01.870 --> 02:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
representative goalie and then
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair and thank
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
you for addressing that part because
 
02:09:08.669 --> 02:09:08.679 align:start position:0%
that's one of my concerns is why we
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
always don't like to put things into
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
statute because we know how long it can
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
take to change that statute if need be
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to reach out and
 
02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:20.390 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to reach out and
reading

02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
reading
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
your uh code of ethics and I heard from
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsor um that in this bill he was
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
using the uh European guidelines as well
 
02:09:34.270 --> 02:09:34.280 align:start position:0%
as some of Connecticut's statutes I
 
02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe but I just wanted to touch
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
upon letting us know how much of the
 
02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
European Union guidelines you're using
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
because I was surprised to see that
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
that's right here in your guidelines the
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
same yeah guidelines he's looking for in
 
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
his legislation that you already are
 
02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
adopting right could you just exp they
 
02:09:55.790 --> 02:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
using the guidelines as a whole or just
 
02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:57.310 align:start position:0%
using the guidelines as a whole or just
in

02:09:57.310 --> 02:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
part um I can't I I can't answer that
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know the I don't know
 
02:10:07.950 --> 02:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
the all of the details to give you a a
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
factual answer on that but we we are
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
leveraging those guidelines U for for
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
our efforts I don't know that we're
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
using the whole of
 
02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:19.470 align:start position:0%
using the whole of
them

02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative Brown thank you madam
 
02:10:23.950 --> 02:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
going back to something you said I don't
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
know if you if if it was an example is
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
there actually a suicide hotline that's
 
02:10:32.629 --> 02:10:32.639 align:start position:0%
managed by a chat
 
02:10:35.470 --> 02:10:35.480 align:start position:0%
box Chad bot well it's it's actually not
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
in in state in state um government but
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
um there is a a
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
veteran's hot line yeah in which case in
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
which case we can't do anything about it
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah no I and I I just I wanted to use
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
that as an example because we could do
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
that right we you know 211 made for
 
02:10:58.830 --> 02:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
example decide to start using technology
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
that would help in that way and um I
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
don't know that they're that they're
 
02:11:04.750 --> 02:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
they are intending to do that but just
 
02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:06.229 align:start position:0%
they are intending to do that but just
an

02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
example okay or possibly 511 could uh
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
decide to direct people to side roads
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
instead of the main roads or whatever
 
02:11:15.599 --> 02:11:16.870 align:start position:0%
instead of the main roads or whatever
represent

02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
gold thank you thank you madam chair and
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
question my earlier question regarding
 
02:11:26.950 --> 02:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
the peacemeal nature of bills or
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
legislation around AI having you know
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
this stuff all travels at the speed of
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
light I agree and my
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
experience in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
and it is very ancient compared to the
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
speed of but I I know
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
that the system was done peace me and
 
02:11:47.950 --> 02:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
then you came in and had to take over
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
these these bits and pieces and try to
 
02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
create one cohesive system and that's a
 
02:11:54.069 --> 02:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
little bit of where my concern is coming
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
in if we have multiple bills coming in
 
02:11:59.950 --> 02:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
addressing the topic of I really like
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
the idea of being ahead of the eightball
 
02:12:05.549 --> 02:12:05.559 align:start position:0%
and and I like the idea of of a
 
02:12:08.149 --> 02:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
commission that can assist you of with
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
all this expertise that can stay
 
02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
flexible and and keep a breast so I'd
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
like your thoughts about that if you had
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
an IT Commission not an office a paid
 
02:12:22.390 --> 02:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
office but one of our our uh volunteer
 
02:12:24.430 --> 02:12:24.440 align:start position:0%
commissions do you think that would be
 
02:12:27.069 --> 02:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
beneficial to your three-man office in
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
making these decisions and moving ahead
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
well the the three person office is is
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
for just the website stuff so we have a
 
02:12:36.549 --> 02:12:36.559 align:start position:0%
you know a large Department looking at
 
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
this and and and paying attention to
 
02:12:40.990 --> 02:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
this and it's really top of mind not
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
just for New Hampshire doit but for all
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
it all state government it in fact the
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
National Association of State Chief
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
Information officers um is really
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
focused on on AI right now and how we
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
how we manage correctly through the
 
02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
process of of dealing with this
 
02:13:03.910 --> 02:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
technology Revolution that's occurring
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
but the the types of bills that are out
 
02:13:08.910 --> 02:13:08.920 align:start position:0%
there around the country are twofold
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
most of them are Public public policy
 
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
Focus like the
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
election bill that we're talking about
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
and and in that case you know it really
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall into anything I have a
 
02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
right as a commissioner to have an
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
opinion on but I think that we're seeing
 
02:13:26.589 --> 02:13:26.599 align:start position:0%
large impacts with AI from a public
 
02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:28.599 align:start position:0%
policy perspective and it's certainly
 
02:13:30.430 --> 02:13:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know something that we need to
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
address I um probably sooner than later
 
02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
um inward inwardly facing is my
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
perspective here and and and again I I
 
02:13:42.709 --> 02:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
think we really need to pay attention we
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
really need to adapt quickly um there as
 
02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:50.589 align:start position:0%
really need to adapt quickly um there as
well

02:13:50.589 --> 02:13:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:52.750 --> 02:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
I I feel like the management structure
 
02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
that exists inside doit is adequate to
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
to continue to manage on a policy level
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the executive branch thank you
 
02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
for clarification on the last question
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
just a a slight bit more clarification
 
02:14:11.470 --> 02:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
on kind of follow up on my my last
 
02:14:13.149 --> 02:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to work my way
 
02:14:13.159 --> 02:14:13.910 align:start position:0%
question I'm trying to work my way
through

02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
this when you talk about the need to
 
02:14:20.589 --> 02:14:20.599 align:start position:0%
respond to things quickly um I feel like
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's two things that that
 
02:14:24.069 --> 02:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
could apply to that that is
 
02:14:26.549 --> 02:14:26.559 align:start position:0%
implementation by the state of AI
 
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
processes right so we're going to use AI
 
02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to implement it for
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
different reasons and the the second in
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
my mind would be to protect our
 
02:14:38.709 --> 02:14:38.719 align:start position:0%
constituents against AI from the outside
 
02:14:40.510 --> 02:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that we'd have to be
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
able to respond quickly in protecting
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
against AI from the
 
02:14:46.910 --> 02:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
outside but it seems to me this bill is
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
mostly dealing with our own
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
implementation of AI why would we need
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to respond Qui quickly to our
 
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
own implementation of AI wouldn't be
 
02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
more prudent to be as has been spoken
 
02:14:59.709 --> 02:14:59.719 align:start position:0%
more cautious about that because we
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to be on The
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
Cutting Edge of it U so I'm just
 
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:05.960 align:start position:0%
wondering what your mindset I yeah so I
 
02:15:08.030 --> 02:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't explain myself well but I'm I
 
02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
don't feel the need to move quickly in
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
the implementation of AI in state
 
02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
government and we we're traditionally
 
02:15:18.750 --> 02:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
pretty conservative uh the and that's
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
reflected on how the agencies operate as
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
it relates to
 
02:15:26.589 --> 02:15:26.599 align:start position:0%
technology um so I'm not seeing a large
 
02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
impetus to implement AI stuff inside
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
State inside uh the agencies so um but
 
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
as our as our partners add technology
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
technology that any person inside the
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
executive branch could potentially
 
02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
Implement um I want to I want to be able
 
02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
to adapt to that quickly in terms
 
02:15:53.189 --> 02:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
of guidelines around usage that would
 
02:15:53.199 --> 02:15:54.430 align:start position:0%
of guidelines around usage that would
not

02:15:54.430 --> 02:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:15:57.270 --> 02:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
transgress um you
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
know our citizens rights the rights of
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
the people that come visit in Hamp how
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
whatever so that's really what I was
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
thinking okay thank you for the
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
clarification you're welcome other
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions pres
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair so it was
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier but we didn't get
 
02:16:16.390 --> 02:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
really get into it uh the idea of uh
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
rules being somewhat faster than statuto
 
02:16:23.910 --> 02:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
things but are there currently any rules
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
that you're working on I mean they have
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
to have a statute to underpin them of
 
02:16:31.709 --> 02:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
course but do you feel you have the the
 
02:16:34.509 --> 02:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
uh the current authority to promulgate
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
rules in this direction that you are
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
working on as a member of the jelar I'm
 
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
wondering U well actually we we we don't
 
02:16:45.509 --> 02:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
actually have Ru making Authority per se
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
in doit but what we do have is through
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
the through the action of the um
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
Information Technology Council we can um
 
02:16:55.950 --> 02:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
Implement policy which then has the
 
02:16:58.790 --> 02:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
force of law so um that's how how we
 
02:17:01.349 --> 02:17:01.359 align:start position:0%
operate so the excuse me your policy has
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
the force of
 
02:17:08.870 --> 02:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
law if it it there's um there's um
 
02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
language in in 21r that allows I I
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
probably that was probably too strong a
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
way to State it my apologies
 
02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:18.389 align:start position:0%
way to State it my apologies
but

02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
we can enforce policy inside the
 
02:17:23.709 --> 02:17:23.719 align:start position:0%
executive branch um through the um
 
02:17:26.190 --> 02:17:26.200 align:start position:0%
actions of the it Council and the IT
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
council is itself in statute it's the
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
the wording is a little
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
bit you know am ambiguous
 
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
but thank you you're welcome other
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much all right
 
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I think this will be going to
 
02:17:47.230 --> 02:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee there's more stuff popping
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
up than then we need to look
 
02:17:53.070 --> 02:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
at uh is there anyone else who wishes to
 
02:17:56.669 --> 02:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:59.549 --> 02:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
1688 all right seeing none I will close
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
the public hearing this will be going to
 
02:18:07.790 --> 02:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:27.750 align:start position:0%
 
one's

02:18:27.750 --> 02:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:46.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:46.519 --> 03:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
prohibitions

03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.510 --> 03:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
good morning or good afternoon welcome
 
03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
to Edna I'm opening the hearing on House
 
03:31:27.359 --> 03:31:28.429 align:start position:0%
to Edna I'm opening the hearing on House
Bill

03:31:28.429 --> 03:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:31:31.630 --> 03:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
1456 and call Representative
 
03:31:34.150 --> 03:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
Walsh good afternoon Madam chair thank
 
03:31:36.189 --> 03:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
you um for the record my name is
 
03:31:39.189 --> 03:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative Tom Walsh uh from marac
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
10 which are the towns of hookit and D
 
03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
Bon and I'm here today to introduce
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:31:44.720 --> 03:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
House Bill
1456

03:31:46.790 --> 03:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
1456
 
03:31:49.309 --> 03:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
um uh this issue was brought to me by
 
03:31:51.550 --> 03:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
the way thank you for having me in Edna
 
03:31:52.790 --> 03:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
I've been here for 12 years and I've
 
03:31:54.550 --> 03:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
never been before this committee so it's
 
03:31:57.349 --> 03:31:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's an honor uh this is usually outside
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
my wheelhouse too uh but this was
 
03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
brought to me by um a constituent about
 
03:32:04.229 --> 03:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
an issue with the land and tax appeals
 
03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and as it turns out the housing appeals
 
03:32:09.070 --> 03:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
board in terms of when it it's required
 
03:32:11.950 --> 03:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
or needed to have somebody uh removed
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
from from either one of them uh as I
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
looked into it I noticed that uh the
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
both of the boards were
 
03:32:21.229 --> 03:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
currently um appointed by the Supreme
 
03:32:23.870 --> 03:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
Court and that's fine it was clear but
 
03:32:26.870 --> 03:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
when you get to the removal which is 71
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
B3 or
 
03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
6793 language is very similar it was
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
just very vague on who actually did the
 
03:32:38.790 --> 03:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
removing um so looking for a solution um
 
03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
I thought about it for a bit and I
 
03:32:41.790 --> 03:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
actually spoke with with representative
 
03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
Lynn who was on the Supreme Court and I
 
03:32:47.750 --> 03:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I said well you know both boards
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
actually operate on a quasi
 
03:32:53.189 --> 03:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
judicial uh Manner and I said the
 
03:32:54.790 --> 03:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
governor and Council actually do the
 
03:32:57.670 --> 03:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
appointing for the the uh for the judges
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't they do the same thing he
 
03:33:02.630 --> 03:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
agreed and he uh was also willing to
 
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:05.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor it for those reasons um so
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's all the bill does it moves the
 
03:33:10.429 --> 03:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
appointment and the removal of both land
 
03:33:12.590 --> 03:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
and tax tax appeals board housing
 
03:33:15.750 --> 03:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
appeals board um to the council the
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
governor and councel um and again I
 
03:33:19.910 --> 03:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
you've got it in front of you so I don't
 
03:33:23.309 --> 03:33:23.319 align:start position:0%
need to do all the references but uh
 
03:33:25.830 --> 03:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
4.1 uh actually was added to both of
 
03:33:28.229 --> 03:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
those sections for the removal uh which
 
03:33:31.870 --> 03:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
does just that um I did get
 
03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
unfortunately representative Lynn
 
03:33:34.750 --> 03:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it today he's got another
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh hearing going on uh he does uh he did
 
03:33:40.229 --> 03:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
ask me to state that he does fully
 
03:33:41.950 --> 03:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
support this this uh he did have a
 
03:33:45.150 --> 03:33:45.160 align:start position:0%
suggestion for an amendment that uh
 
03:33:46.950 --> 03:33:46.960 align:start position:0%
possibly wouldn't affect the current
 
03:33:48.750 --> 03:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
members of these boards if you do think
 
03:33:50.750 --> 03:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
A change is uh is
 
03:33:54.030 --> 03:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
required um and I guess there are some
 
03:33:56.030 --> 03:33:56.040 align:start position:0%
people here with some proposed
 
03:33:59.830 --> 03:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
suggestions for an amendment beyond that
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh for me I'm just trying to see that
 
03:34:05.150 --> 03:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
the um um the the removal process gets
 
03:34:08.269 --> 03:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
cleared up and that's pretty much all I
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
care hope to see so in your wisdom uh
 
03:34:14.870 --> 03:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
any changes you see or find with me
 
03:34:16.710 --> 03:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's all I've got well thank you we'll
 
03:34:19.110 --> 03:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
take full advantage of that I'm
 
03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
sure any questions represent laus yeah I
 
03:34:23.870 --> 03:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
just have a I I see that what was handed
 
03:34:27.469 --> 03:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
out includes a uh proposed amendment and
 
03:34:28.630 --> 03:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't had a chance to look through
 
03:34:32.510 --> 03:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
it in detail but what from it is it
 
03:34:34.910 --> 03:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
just grandfathering in the current
 
03:34:36.750 --> 03:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
people or what is this amendment doing
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
and is this
 
03:34:39.830 --> 03:34:39.840 align:start position:0%

you did uh but I know there was somebody
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%

yeah my name is Michelle LeBrun and I
 
03:35:31.429 --> 03:35:31.439 align:start position:0%

first good afternoon Madam chair and
 
03:35:36.030 --> 03:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
honorable members of this committee
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the opportun
 
03:35:39.550 --> 03:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
affording US the opportunity to speak
 
03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
this with you this afternoon
 
03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:45.550 align:start position:0%
this with you this afternoon
be

03:35:45.550 --> 03:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.830 --> 03:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
better my apologies sir good afternoon
 
03:35:50.550 --> 03:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to address
 
03:35:52.429 --> 03:35:52.439 align:start position:0%
this honorable committee this afternoon
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Eric wind I am a recently
 
03:35:57.150 --> 03:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
appointed member of the board um and we
 
03:35:59.950 --> 03:35:59.960 align:start position:0%
also have the member Walker and the
 
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
board clerk with us as well to answer
 
03:36:04.189 --> 03:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
any questions um we wanted to be here
 
03:36:06.950 --> 03:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
today to address certain aspects of this
 
03:36:09.189 --> 03:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation and the fact that
 
03:36:10.830 --> 03:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
we do agree that there is a need to
 
03:36:13.469 --> 03:36:13.479 align:start position:0%
improve the appointment process as and
 
03:36:14.830 --> 03:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
the removal
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
process um the appointment process at
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
present does not afford any statutory
 
03:36:24.030 --> 03:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the public to be involved
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
to give comment or for a hearing and the
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
removal process is is ambiguous as to
 
03:36:32.110 --> 03:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
which branch of government would take
 
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
the lead on removing a member so those
 
03:36:36.030 --> 03:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
are the two key
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
issues in the amendment we do propose a
 
03:36:43.469 --> 03:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
intermediary step to replacing the
 
03:36:45.630 --> 03:36:45.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court entirely in the
 
03:36:45.640 --> 03:36:47.030 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court entirely in the
appointment

03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
process um and so I do want to briefly
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
comment on that that that is an
 
03:36:53.309 --> 03:36:53.319 align:start position:0%
alternative that we would encourage this
 
03:36:55.469 --> 03:36:55.479 align:start position:0%
committee to consider given the duties
 
03:36:58.550 --> 03:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the board and the important role that
 
03:37:01.229 --> 03:37:01.239 align:start position:0%
the board plays in taxation here in New
 
03:37:04.269 --> 03:37:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and that that's there for
 
03:37:06.150 --> 03:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
your consideration that
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
the a new member of the board would be
 
03:37:10.590 --> 03:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
nominated by the Supreme Court would be
 
03:37:11.950 --> 03:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
the alternative that we would ask you to
 
03:37:14.429 --> 03:37:14.439 align:start position:0%
consider but still go through a full GNC
 
03:37:14.439 --> 03:37:15.870 align:start position:0%
consider but still go through a full GNC
hearing

03:37:15.870 --> 03:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:37:15.880 --> 03:37:17.870 align:start position:0%
hearing
process

03:37:17.870 --> 03:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:37:21.590 --> 03:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and then on the removal
 
03:37:21.600 --> 03:37:25.710 align:start position:0%
um and then on the removal
aspect

03:37:25.710 --> 03:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.750 --> 03:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
the the amendment does take the language
 
03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
out of
 
03:37:37.469 --> 03:37:37.479 align:start position:0%
RSA 71-b colon 2 and inserts it into an
 
03:37:39.910 --> 03:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
existing provision related to removal
 
03:37:39.920 --> 03:37:40.910 align:start position:0%
existing provision related to removal
located

03:37:40.910 --> 03:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
located
 
03:37:44.269 --> 03:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
71-b colon 3 but it otherwise it does
 
03:37:46.670 --> 03:37:46.680 align:start position:0%
not substantively change the proposal
 
03:37:48.229 --> 03:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
which is to conform the standard of
 
03:37:49.950 --> 03:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
removal with RSA
 
03:37:52.389 --> 03:37:52.399 align:start position:0%
41 and then lastly there is also a
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
technical note that currently board
 
03:37:58.469 --> 03:37:58.479 align:start position:0%
members serve three years and the terms
 
03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
are not staggered for two of us and so
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
as you're in this legislation working on
 
03:38:05.189 --> 03:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
that that's a technical fix that we do
 
03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that you change so that terms
 
03:38:10.910 --> 03:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
do not expire at the same time and and
 
03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
we also recommend the terms be extended
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
to 5 years so it's comparable with the
 
03:38:15.950 --> 03:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and other
 
03:38:15.960 --> 03:38:17.070 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and other
statutory

03:38:17.070 --> 03:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
03:38:20.110 --> 03:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
tribunals um so I'm available to take
 
03:38:22.070 --> 03:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
questions but at this time I'll turn the
 
03:38:28.229 --> 03:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:31.070 --> 03:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
LeBron thank you I just want to comment
 
03:38:33.870 --> 03:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit on the Supreme Court
 
03:38:38.309 --> 03:38:38.319 align:start position:0%
appointment um it goes back to the early
 
03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
1900s and it has worked except for the
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
fact that there is no transparency as to
 
03:38:48.750 --> 03:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
who is appointed and that goes for the
 
03:38:51.030 --> 03:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
board too we don't know who's appointed
 
03:38:54.070 --> 03:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
until until they pretty much come on
 
03:38:58.590 --> 03:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
board um I we think there should be
 
03:39:01.870 --> 03:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
transparency we think the court
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
does um a good job of vetting any
 
03:39:09.670 --> 03:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
prospective applicants for the job they
 
03:39:12.670 --> 03:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
um file applications they file letters
 
03:39:16.030 --> 03:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
of recommendations they file written uh
 
03:39:18.750 --> 03:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
work that they have done in Prior jobs
 
03:39:18.760 --> 03:39:19.750 align:start position:0%
work that they have done in Prior jobs
and

03:39:19.750 --> 03:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:22.189 --> 03:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
references and they do need to be
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
learned and experienced in questions of
 
03:39:27.910 --> 03:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
Taxation or real estate
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
valuation or both and one must be ATT an
 
03:39:35.229 --> 03:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
attorney and attorney wind is an
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
attorney um so our suggest question that
 
03:39:46.830 --> 03:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
the court keep that phase of the of the
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
um nomination of of the
 
03:39:56.469 --> 03:39:56.479 align:start position:0%
prospective um employee we think is very
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
important and then we would it would be
 
03:40:01.269 --> 03:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
turned over to the governor and councel
 
03:40:03.189 --> 03:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
and the governor and councel would then
 
03:40:04.469 --> 03:40:04.479 align:start position:0%
review the
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
applications and hold hearings so that
 
03:40:09.269 --> 03:40:09.279 align:start position:0%
there would be total transparency if
 
03:40:13.269 --> 03:40:13.279 align:start position:0%
anyone had any issues with them and as
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
far as a removal of the uh any employee
 
03:40:23.189 --> 03:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
who has is removed for malfeasance
 
03:40:26.830 --> 03:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
misfeasance or anything in and for colum
 
03:40:32.030 --> 03:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
one uh there is ambiguity there and
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
there has been issues in the past
 
03:40:38.910 --> 03:40:38.920 align:start position:0%
where it the governor has to be involved
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
and the court has to be in involved and
 
03:40:46.750 --> 03:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
it has caused timelines and uh problems
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
for the board members that is s still
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
sitting the two remaining board members
 
03:40:54.670 --> 03:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
and we think that that should be in the
 
03:40:57.189 --> 03:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
hands of the governor and Council and
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
not the
 
03:41:01.150 --> 03:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
court and just one further thing on the
 
03:41:04.790 --> 03:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
court if the court nominates any
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
further uh issues whether or not someone
 
03:41:11.189 --> 03:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
seeks reappointments would go to the
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
governor and councel
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
also so we we think that's a good
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
alternative to the way the statute reads
 
03:41:22.830 --> 03:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
and we do agree that the statute does
 
03:41:25.469 --> 03:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
need transparency
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
and okay that's all I have thank you are
 
03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
03:41:33.630 --> 03:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
representative leus then Gould and
 
03:41:36.870 --> 03:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
manuti this might be for the chair or
 
03:41:40.389 --> 03:41:40.399 align:start position:0%
somebody else um we have you know like
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
all the boards Pro PLC it's uh governor
 
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
and counsel but is that process normally
 
03:41:47.910 --> 03:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
include a public hearing because this
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
explicit I know they're public meetings
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
but they have public hearings because
 
03:41:53.790 --> 03:41:53.800 align:start position:0%
this is explicitly asking for a public
 
03:41:55.070 --> 03:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
hearing as part of the governor and
 
03:41:58.189 --> 03:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
councel SE um process and is that normal
 
03:42:00.510 --> 03:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
or would that be it is it's certainly
 
03:42:03.550 --> 03:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
not common on say public members to
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
licensing boards but uh for major things
 
03:42:11.309 --> 03:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
that might be I I really don't know okay
 
03:42:13.870 --> 03:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I think we're a quazi Judicial
 
03:42:17.630 --> 03:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
agency um we we act very much like the
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
court does in hearing property tax
 
03:42:22.910 --> 03:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
appeals eminent domain appeals so it's
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
important that they they these people be
 
03:42:28.750 --> 03:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
vetted and it is important that there be
 
03:42:31.630 --> 03:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
a public hearing so we are in agreement
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
of that follow up follow up yeah uh
 
03:42:36.070 --> 03:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
again I don't know who this is too but
 
03:42:38.149 --> 03:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
but but the concern is that they don't
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
normally have the process of having
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
public hearings that might be a change
 
03:42:43.229 --> 03:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
that would be problematic there's
 
03:42:45.429 --> 03:42:45.439 align:start position:0%
certainly public hearings for say
 
03:42:47.229 --> 03:42:47.239 align:start position:0%
Commissioners okay so they know how to
 
03:42:49.950 --> 03:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
do it all right thank you judges judges
 
03:42:53.950 --> 03:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
yes exactly it's not not it may not be
 
03:42:56.469 --> 03:42:56.479 align:start position:0%
for some of the boards we deal with but
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
they know how to do that representative
 
03:43:03.550 --> 03:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
gold thank Madam chair is and and
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
forgive me if you said this but is there
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
a limit on how many terms um a member
 
03:43:11.229 --> 03:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
can serve
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
no there isn't a limit on the number of
 
03:43:15.429 --> 03:43:15.439 align:start position:0%
terms actually I've been a board member
 
03:43:15.439 --> 03:43:16.790 align:start position:0%
terms actually I've been a board member
since

03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
1991 um I was a clerk prior to being the
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
board member so my experience is quite
 
03:43:27.309 --> 03:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
extensive and we need that with the
 
03:43:30.189 --> 03:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
board we need to have consistency in our
 
03:43:35.469 --> 03:43:35.479 align:start position:0%
decisions so like the judges we we tend
 
03:43:41.149 --> 03:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
to stay on longer than just a term
 
03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative manui thank you
 
03:43:45.750 --> 03:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair this is nothing to do with
 
03:43:48.510 --> 03:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
the bill just curiosity we've been
 
03:43:50.269 --> 03:43:50.279 align:start position:0%
talking about button and information
 
03:43:53.389 --> 03:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
right hand side it says Governor Hugh
 
03:43:58.269 --> 03:43:58.279 align:start position:0%
Gallen is the stationary old stationary
 
03:44:01.110 --> 03:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
recycled no that is an old stationary
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
we're in the governor gallon Office Park
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
which is the on Pleasant Street there
 
03:44:11.149 --> 03:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
nothing to do
 
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
no it was named after
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
him thank you that's a pretty clear
 
03:44:17.560 --> 03:44:18.550 align:start position:0%
him thank you that's a pretty clear
represent

03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
represent
 
03:44:21.389 --> 03:44:21.399 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair just
 
03:44:21.399 --> 03:44:23.590 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair just
curious

03:44:23.590 --> 03:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
curious
 
03:44:26.030 --> 03:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
on why
 
03:44:29.510 --> 03:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court or the now the
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
governor and Council are picking the
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
chair versus the members amongst
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
themselves choosing a
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
chair um it it go back it goes back as
 
03:44:44.030 --> 03:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
far as uh the early 1900s the the court
 
03:44:46.870 --> 03:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
has always decided who would be the
 
03:44:50.910 --> 03:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
chair um based on their experience and
 
03:44:53.510 --> 03:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
once the chair leaves and they they
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
would appoint in all likelihood a chair
 
03:44:59.349 --> 03:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
from the remaining board members and
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
then appoint a new board
 
03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:10.269 --> 03:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
followup would you be opposed if we
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
allowed the members to choose the chair
 
03:45:13.710 --> 03:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
obviously you folks have been in the
 
03:45:15.349 --> 03:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
position long enough to know who has the
 
03:45:16.590 --> 03:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
experience I would hope you can make
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
that decision amongst yourselves
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
personing someone else making it for
 
03:45:23.070 --> 03:45:23.080 align:start position:0%
you um I think it's a three- member
 
03:45:25.070 --> 03:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
board and I think once the chair has
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
been appointed it's the chair does more
 
03:45:32.070 --> 03:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
than what the board me other board
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
members do the chair does a lot of
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
administrative work works with the clerk
 
03:45:42.349 --> 03:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
on a lot of issues the budget the rules
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
and the experience there is more
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
extensive than it is with a regular
 
03:45:50.950 --> 03:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
member so once you have a chair I think
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's good to keep that chair on
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
until it's time to appoint another one
 
03:46:00.149 --> 03:46:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the governor and Council I would
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
assume would be the ones that would
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
appoint the next chair when I retire
 
03:46:10.870 --> 03:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
which may not be that long um
 
03:46:16.110 --> 03:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think that that system
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
works all right thank you uh as a qu
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
quasi judicial board are you subject to
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
the age 70 retirement requirement the
 
03:46:30.189 --> 03:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
judges have no we are not okay thank you
 
03:46:30.199 --> 03:46:31.590 align:start position:0%
judges have no we are not okay thank you
other

03:46:31.590 --> 03:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:46:31.600 --> 03:46:33.630 align:start position:0%
other
questions

03:46:33.630 --> 03:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:46:37.070 --> 03:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair um I I
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions um so I I serve
 
03:46:44.229 --> 03:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
on the assessing Standards Board so uh
 
03:46:49.110 --> 03:46:49.120 align:start position:0%
btla is a frequent subject of discussion
 
03:46:51.070 --> 03:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
with regard to the issues that we
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
confront um but um uh the the question I
 
03:46:58.750 --> 03:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
have well I want to point out one thing
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that is the governor does nominate
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
the Chief
 
03:47:04.429 --> 03:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
Justice uh I don't think the Chief
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
Justice of the superior court is chosen
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
by the other judges I'm pretty sure the
 
03:47:12.149 --> 03:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the district and the
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
and the superior court system are both
 
03:47:18.910 --> 03:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh nominated and of course approved by
 
03:47:23.110 --> 03:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
the uh by the GNC but nominated by the
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
governor so that's an answer so uh my
 
03:47:26.080 --> 03:47:26.990 align:start position:0%
governor so that's an answer so uh my
question

03:47:26.990 --> 03:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:47:30.309 --> 03:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
is uh since chairman Walsh is bringing
 
03:47:33.189 --> 03:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
this bill um because there's an
 
03:47:36.469 --> 03:47:36.479 align:start position:0%
inconsistency in the uh in the way the
 
03:47:39.149 --> 03:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
the board is appointed Visa many of our
 
03:47:42.870 --> 03:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
other boards uh are there any problems
 
03:47:46.710 --> 03:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh that have plagued the btla in the U
 
03:47:49.510 --> 03:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the recent past with any of the
 
03:47:53.110 --> 03:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
current members complaints other than
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
people being unhappy with your decisions
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
obviously there's always a winner and a
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
loser you're talking about other board
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
members any complaints being filed I
 
03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:06.710 align:start position:0%
members any complaints being filed I

I can tell you there has been but it's a
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
confidential matter that I cannot speak
 
03:48:11.920 --> 03:48:13.710 align:start position:0%
confidential matter that I cannot speak
about

03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:13.720 align:start position:0%

03:48:42.309 --> 03:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
the committee I will try to um keep my
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
comments brief and not repeat but um I
 
03:48:49.950 --> 03:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
have been the board's clerk for going on
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
almost 23 years now and um I can what I
 
03:48:55.750 --> 03:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
can add to this I fully support the
 
03:48:59.149 --> 03:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and I have always believed um
 
03:49:01.149 --> 03:49:01.159 align:start position:0%
and Michelle can attest to that that uh
 
03:49:02.910 --> 03:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
since the day I got there I never
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
understood why there was um it was
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
written the way it was both on the um
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
hiring and the removal process process
 
03:49:12.910 --> 03:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be it just fell short of um
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
processes that should be there and but
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
what I can tell you um I fully support
 
03:49:22.990 --> 03:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
the fiveyear term um and I also have
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
listened to taxpayers for 23 years talk
 
03:49:28.269 --> 03:49:28.279 align:start position:0%
about and ask questions about well how
 
03:49:29.590 --> 03:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
are they appointed what's their
 
03:49:32.910 --> 03:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
background what was the process and I've
 
03:49:36.990 --> 03:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
tried to explain each person that I've
 
03:49:38.149 --> 03:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
worked with and I've worked for many
 
03:49:40.309 --> 03:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
different boards um Michelle's probably
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
been the constant um the constant but
 
03:49:44.590 --> 03:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
I've worked with a lot of board members
 
03:49:45.510 --> 03:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
and they all did bring something
 
03:49:46.990 --> 03:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
different to the table but the five
 
03:49:50.149 --> 03:49:50.159 align:start position:0%
years what I've also seen from my seat
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
um is the fact that
 
03:49:54.510 --> 03:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
they if a new member comes on they
 
03:49:56.269 --> 03:49:56.279 align:start position:0%
almost need a year or two just to get
 
03:49:58.070 --> 03:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
caught up to speed yes they bring skills
 
03:50:01.710 --> 03:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
to the table but as an adjudicative body
 
03:50:03.630 --> 03:50:03.640 align:start position:0%
there's still a lot to learn and a lot
 
03:50:05.429 --> 03:50:05.439 align:start position:0%
of people um if you're coming in say
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
from the appraisal world all of a sudden
 
03:50:09.750 --> 03:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
you're thrown into what looks very much
 
03:50:12.269 --> 03:50:12.279 align:start position:0%
like a courtroom um my own title as
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
clerk was modeled after a court clerk um
 
03:50:17.550 --> 03:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
certainly don't get the salary let me be
 
03:50:21.149 --> 03:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
clear but um but we're set up exactly
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
like a court when you come to us and and
 
03:50:25.710 --> 03:50:25.720 align:start position:0%
we are user friendly for for the Joe
 
03:50:27.550 --> 03:50:27.560 align:start position:0%
homeowner can do this himself and
 
03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
represent himself in what is actually
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
looks and drives like a court but I
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
believe what I would focus you on when
 
03:50:37.990 --> 03:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
you make any decisions um I I I love the
 
03:50:39.630 --> 03:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
idea of the nomination and the the court
 
03:50:42.590 --> 03:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
vetting the candidates um because yeah
 
03:50:44.229 --> 03:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
you can re read a resume but when they
 
03:50:46.710 --> 03:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
go in for an interview the statute in 71
 
03:50:49.630 --> 03:50:49.640 align:start position:0%
B1 which you don't have specifically
 
03:50:51.910 --> 03:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
says that they the board members must be
 
03:50:53.710 --> 03:50:53.720 align:start position:0%
learned and
 
03:50:56.469 --> 03:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
experienced in questions of
 
03:51:00.070 --> 03:51:00.080 align:start position:0%
Taxation or real estate valuation and
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
Appraisal or both so we are all about
 
03:51:08.469 --> 03:51:08.479 align:start position:0%
valuation and my concern um and I'm not
 
03:51:11.070 --> 03:51:11.080 align:start position:0%
saying GNC can't do that but I want to
 
03:51:14.710 --> 03:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that the right people come up
 
03:51:17.910 --> 03:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
and put into these positions um and they
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
have those skills and I think the court
 
03:51:22.790 --> 03:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
understands um because they see our
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
decisions um some of what we do is
 
03:51:27.710 --> 03:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
appealable in different areas but I
 
03:51:29.790 --> 03:51:29.800 align:start position:0%
really believe that that they are the
 
03:51:32.429 --> 03:51:32.439 align:start position:0%
best folks to vet the candidates and
 
03:51:34.790 --> 03:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that they fit that statutory
 
03:51:37.389 --> 03:51:37.399 align:start position:0%
requirement and I do believe the five
 
03:51:39.830 --> 03:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
years once you get somebody up to speed
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
to say a year and a half two years in 3
 
03:51:44.429 --> 03:51:44.439 align:start position:0%
years they might be out the door who
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
knows but at least if they're there for
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
5 years we always had prior to 2011 we
 
03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
always had a five-year term and I will
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
not even try to explain what had
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
happened but it wasn't at our request to
 
03:52:00.189 --> 03:52:00.199 align:start position:0%
take it down to three the housing board
 
03:52:02.349 --> 03:52:02.359 align:start position:0%
when when they came along three years
 
03:52:05.269 --> 03:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
ago LBA called me and said hey do you
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
mind if we take your statute and model
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
it because we want to do this for the
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
house housing born I'm like well you can
 
03:52:13.389 --> 03:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
copy and paste that's up to you but they
 
03:52:15.990 --> 03:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
ended up with 5 years and I think that's
 
03:52:17.469 --> 03:52:17.479 align:start position:0%
a good thing and I'm also chair of the
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
hooks at zoning board I know
 
03:52:21.349 --> 03:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh he was at one point
 
03:52:24.910 --> 03:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
when I was chair of the um I'm still
 
03:52:26.830 --> 03:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the zba and he was chair of the
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
planning board so we've cross passed
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
there and um he and I both he a year ago
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
today actually Valentine's Day he and I
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
had a case at the I had a case at the
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
housing board it was my first experience
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
they are actually in the same building
 
03:52:42.870 --> 03:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
as we are we went to a hearing and long
 
03:52:45.950 --> 03:52:45.960 align:start position:0%
story short um I don't want to speak to
 
03:52:47.830 --> 03:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
them but I see them very much in the
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
same light as somebody you know even a
 
03:52:51.870 --> 03:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
zoning board is a is a quasi judicial
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
board we are sort of the judge and jury
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the facts to the to the law um so but
 
03:53:00.870 --> 03:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I just want to point out the skill
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
level and they if you read what is
 
03:53:05.710 --> 03:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
required for that board um they need a
 
03:53:09.710 --> 03:53:09.720 align:start position:0%
land surveyor you know so maybe that is
 
03:53:13.630 --> 03:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
GNC but for for what we do this this has
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
to be somebody that can you know really
 
03:53:21.550 --> 03:53:21.560 align:start position:0%
understand what we we're trying to do um
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
because I guess you know we we see all
 
03:53:26.510 --> 03:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of people but the skill level that
 
03:53:28.110 --> 03:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
these members and members in the past
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
have brought to the board um makes the
 
03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
product the court knows that the product
 
03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
that we put out is of the highest
 
03:53:36.990 --> 03:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
quality they take great pride and they
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
work tirelessly
 
03:53:42.349 --> 03:53:42.359 align:start position:0%
um to follow the law and historically I
 
03:53:45.510 --> 03:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
can understand back in the 1900s when um
 
03:53:47.030 --> 03:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
there was a Board of Equalization and it
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
morphed into what we are today but we go
 
03:53:53.950 --> 03:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
back that long way back to you know 115
 
03:53:56.510 --> 03:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
years ago I understand why they were
 
03:53:57.910 --> 03:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
trying to keep maybe the political
 
03:53:59.469 --> 03:53:59.479 align:start position:0%
influence out of it they didn't have a
 
03:54:02.070 --> 03:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
tax system in place they had nothing
 
03:54:04.590 --> 03:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
over these last hundred years we have a
 
03:54:06.550 --> 03:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
much better system in place much more
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
checks and balances much more oversight
 
03:54:11.750 --> 03:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it makes sense that as history
 
03:54:13.790 --> 03:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
evolves I think it's time that we evolve
 
03:54:17.070 --> 03:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
and these processes just I guess it's
 
03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not one if it's not broken
 
03:54:21.070 --> 03:54:21.080 align:start position:0%
don't fix it but it's broken and I would
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
just ask you to fix it so thank you
 
03:54:26.469 --> 03:54:26.479 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions goalie
 
03:54:27.710 --> 03:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
laus thank you madam
 
03:54:31.159 --> 03:54:32.910 align:start position:0%
laus thank you madam
chair

03:54:32.910 --> 03:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:54:36.309 --> 03:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
so are you in favor of keeping these
 
03:54:38.550 --> 03:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
courts making the nominations versus the
 
03:54:40.790 --> 03:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
execu Council I'm a little confused is
 
03:54:43.110 --> 03:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that where you stand I agree with the
 
03:54:44.630 --> 03:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that they that the board has
 
03:54:47.149 --> 03:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
crafted to have the court do um the
 
03:54:48.790 --> 03:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
nomination and part of that you know
 
03:54:50.349 --> 03:54:50.359 align:start position:0%
interviewing process and then turn it
 
03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
over to GNC because taxpayers and I am a
 
03:54:55.349 --> 03:54:55.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer I believe in transparency I
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
think the GNC the way I watch other
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
justices be you know put in those
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
situations of a public hearing I think
 
03:55:07.269 --> 03:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
that's a fair process taxpayers can um
 
03:55:09.630 --> 03:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
you know certainly voice their concerns
 
03:55:12.070 --> 03:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
or or or not maybe in support and you
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
know I'll tell you a story of the 1990s
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
and I I wasn't there this was late 90s I
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
heard about it after I started there was
 
03:55:19.630 --> 03:55:19.640 align:start position:0%
a situation where the court had
 
03:55:22.630 --> 03:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
appointed a person um as a board member
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
and as it was told to me um they worked
 
03:55:27.790 --> 03:55:27.800 align:start position:0%
for the agency for six months and
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
somehow once do got wind of it there was
 
03:55:33.149 --> 03:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
a huge conflict with that person in the
 
03:55:35.070 --> 03:55:35.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and that person
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
had to resign and so if dot had been
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
provided a a
 
03:55:42.990 --> 03:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
a public forum to voice that concern had
 
03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
they known um maybe they could have
 
03:55:47.550 --> 03:55:47.560 align:start position:0%
avoided all the time in expense of that
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
um so it's unfortunate but that's that's
 
03:55:53.149 --> 03:55:53.159 align:start position:0%
a a situation followup and one more
 
03:55:54.630 --> 03:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
followup I'm going to ask you same
 
03:55:57.149 --> 03:55:57.159 align:start position:0%
question asked
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
before do you think whether it be
 
03:56:03.229 --> 03:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
through the nominating processes Supreme
 
03:56:04.950 --> 03:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
Court executive counsel or do you think
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
the board themselves should elect a
 
03:56:09.590 --> 03:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
chair because I think they talk about
 
03:56:11.429 --> 03:56:11.439 align:start position:0%
experience and everything else but those
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
members on the board as the three
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
members they are I think understand who
 
03:56:16.550 --> 03:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
has the experience going forward to make
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
that decision themselves versus if the
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
chair should leave now also make an
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
appointment and appoint a new chair of
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
the board can't
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
they figure that out amongst
 
03:56:30.720 --> 03:56:33.070 align:start position:0%
they figure that out amongst
themselves

03:56:33.070 --> 03:56:33.080 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
um I of course I think they I think they
 
03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
could but I I always believe um and I
 
03:56:40.030 --> 03:56:40.040 align:start position:0%
know I've heard this from different
 
03:56:41.910 --> 03:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
court clerks over the years um they do
 
03:56:44.030 --> 03:56:44.040 align:start position:0%
it by seniority and I think with
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
seniority you have that experience you
 
03:56:49.309 --> 03:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
have that difference to um you know
 
03:56:51.030 --> 03:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
because again some people will come in
 
03:56:52.870 --> 03:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
and yes they they bring the skills
 
03:56:55.469 --> 03:56:55.479 align:start position:0%
required by law but they just they don't
 
03:56:57.790 --> 03:56:57.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're new to running a hearing
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
and that that is an art right um You
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
guys understand that and I think so I I
 
03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
would just say I think GNC can can
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
definitely do that um I don't know I I
 
03:57:11.670 --> 03:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
guess I don't have an opinion because I
 
03:57:15.349 --> 03:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
I also believe they could do it so but
 
03:57:17.830 --> 03:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
um again I like to think people can work
 
03:57:20.229 --> 03:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
it out um but I also believe seniority
 
03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
is the Golden Rule in some situations I
 
03:57:24.990 --> 03:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
think I don't know it's messy and that's
 
03:57:26.950 --> 03:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
why I I would hope instead of having to
 
03:57:28.269 --> 03:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
go through another process with the
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
council and Governor that instead of
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
having we could skip that process and
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
let them do it themselves thank you yeah
 
03:57:38.630 --> 03:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
black thank you um so my question is
 
03:57:41.750 --> 03:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
just on the 3 versus 5year term uh
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
apparently there you've got people who
 
03:57:44.990 --> 03:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
been on there for a long time so if you
 
03:57:47.830 --> 03:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
could answer briefly what specific
 
03:57:51.189 --> 03:57:51.199 align:start position:0%
problem has the three-year term
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
caused um since it seems like you have
 
03:57:55.910 --> 03:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
people that have had pretty long tenure
 
03:57:57.990 --> 03:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't that if there was a problem
 
03:57:59.790 --> 03:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
with somebody obviate the need for doing
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
the removal process because they're
 
03:58:04.429 --> 03:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
reappointment every three years but I
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
can only say I wish the court was here
 
03:58:08.189 --> 03:58:08.199 align:start position:0%
to answer that for you honestly because
 
03:58:08.199 --> 03:58:10.030 align:start position:0%
to answer that for you honestly because
for

03:58:10.030 --> 03:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:58:12.510 --> 03:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
them um you know they've got to read
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
advertise as soon as you get someone in
 
03:58:16.030 --> 03:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
and you you go through the whole process
 
03:58:18.910 --> 03:58:18.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's time to go again um
 
03:58:18.920 --> 03:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
it seems like it's time to go again um
and

03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
again Eric wind is our newest member and
 
03:58:25.510 --> 03:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
again um you know
 
03:58:28.469 --> 03:58:28.479 align:start position:0%
he's he's going to be taking a coup you
 
03:58:30.830 --> 03:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
know some time to get sort of get his
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
sea legs and then you know we're going
 
03:58:36.429 --> 03:58:36.439 align:start position:0%
to have to go back to GNC again um I I
 
03:58:38.830 --> 03:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
just don't see it worked what I know was
 
03:58:41.710 --> 03:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
five years worked fine it worked fine
 
03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't know again there's you know
 
03:58:46.590 --> 03:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
thank you budgets are the way they are
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like getting reelected
 
03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
years all right any uh any other
 
03:58:56.349 --> 03:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
03:59:07.429 --> 03:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:07.439 --> 03:59:09.189 align:start position:0%
 
Frost

03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
Frost
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and good afternoon
 
03:59:12.550 --> 03:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm Ben Frost I'm the
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
deputy executive director of New
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing I had not uh
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
anticipated testifying on this bill um
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I didn't indicate what my position
 
03:59:24.469 --> 03:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
was on the pink card uh but when I heard
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the folks from the btla
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
I thought well that sounds like a
 
03:59:32.189 --> 03:59:32.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise uh I was the
 
03:59:34.830 --> 03:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
original uh pre-introduction drafter of
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
the legislation that formed the housing
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
appeals board I worked closely with then
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Bob GAA uh to craft that
 
03:59:45.670 --> 03:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
legislation based really largely on the
 
03:59:47.790 --> 03:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
structure of the btla and we looked
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
closely at the btla statute then uh to
 
03:59:53.550 --> 03:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
make decisions about how we thought the
 
03:59:55.269 --> 03:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board should be formed
 
03:59:57.510 --> 03:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
and we thought well this this seems
 
04:00:01.710 --> 04:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable we liked the fact that the um
 
04:00:04.590 --> 04:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
the members of the btla were appointed
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
by the Supreme Court uh because it
 
04:00:10.630 --> 04:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
removes it from a political process and
 
04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have that echoed by the
 
04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board I understand
 
04:00:17.469 --> 04:00:17.479 align:start position:0%
however the motivation behind the
 
04:00:19.830 --> 04:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that and that is this was
 
04:00:23.309 --> 04:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
expressed by um by uh representative
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
Lynn uh so after he retired as chief
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
justice became obviously a State Rep and
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
and he speaking on earlier housing
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
appeals board legislation he said as a
 
04:00:38.189 --> 04:00:38.199 align:start position:0%
sitting Justice he didn't like the idea
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
that that he was appointing people whose
 
04:00:44.269 --> 04:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
decisions he would be hearing on appeal
 
04:00:47.070 --> 04:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
and I understood that too I think what
 
04:00:49.870 --> 04:00:49.880 align:start position:0%
the the btla has proposed is a
 
04:00:53.429 --> 04:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable marriage of the two uh it
 
04:00:55.149 --> 04:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
removes it from the political process
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
but then also opens it to transparency
 
04:01:01.590 --> 04:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
so my my hope is that if you uh wish to
 
04:01:03.389 --> 04:01:03.399 align:start position:0%
move forward with that amendment that it
 
04:01:06.389 --> 04:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
would also structurally apply to uh the
 
04:01:08.429 --> 04:01:08.439 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board and do the same
 
04:01:10.710 --> 04:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
thing for both because they the the
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board legislation was
 
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
really based on the structural the the
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
btla um to representative goalie's
 
04:01:21.550 --> 04:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
question to two prior Witnesses um one
 
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
thing I'll point out is that um there
 
04:01:27.110 --> 04:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
statutes vary I'll looking at New
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing statute RSA 204c we
 
04:01:32.590 --> 04:01:32.600 align:start position:0%
have a nine member board that is uh
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
appointed by governor and counsel the
 
04:01:37.349 --> 04:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
chair of our board is appointed by the
 
04:01:37.359 --> 04:01:38.750 align:start position:0%
chair of our board is appointed by the
governor

04:01:38.750 --> 04:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
governor
 
04:01:42.149 --> 04:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
alone on an annual basis even though our
 
04:01:45.469 --> 04:01:45.479 align:start position:0%
members have served fiveyear terms and
 
04:01:47.830 --> 04:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
that works really well for us uh one
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
thing that that does is it removes the
 
04:01:54.670 --> 04:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
possibility of internal popularity
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
contests which can create friction among
 
04:02:00.030 --> 04:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
the members of a of a sitting board so
 
04:02:02.830 --> 04:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh it works well for us what you choose
 
04:02:05.790 --> 04:02:05.800 align:start position:0%
to do here well that's up to you I'm
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
question no I think the other Witnesses
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
got their got your share as
 
04:02:16.990 --> 04:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
well is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:02:20.670 --> 04:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
1456 all right seeing now I will close
 
04:02:26.590 --> 04:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing and open the hearing on
 
04:02:28.030 --> 04:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:37.159 --> 04:02:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
cler

04:02:46.990 --> 04:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.910 --> 04:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
you okay uh for the record I'm state
 
04:03:11.229 --> 04:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
representative John cluder from Sullivan
 
04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
County district 6 comprising the
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
communities of cyen and Claremont and
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
I'm here today in strong support of
 
04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:03:23.149 --> 04:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
1545 which would amend current state law
 
04:03:25.389 --> 04:03:25.399 align:start position:0%
so as to allow the governor and Council
 
04:03:28.510 --> 04:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
to sell or lease Surplus state property
 
04:03:31.269 --> 04:03:31.279 align:start position:0%
at less than fair market value if the
 
04:03:33.469 --> 04:03:33.479 align:start position:0%
property is sold or leased to a
 
04:03:35.910 --> 04:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
nonprofit entity for the construction
 
04:03:38.990 --> 04:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
and development of affordable housing
 
04:03:42.750 --> 04:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1550 1545 I believe is
 
04:03:45.389 --> 04:03:45.399 align:start position:0%
another tool in New Hampshire's toolbox
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
to deal with the state's ongoing
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
affordable housing crisis a crisis that
 
04:03:52.910 --> 04:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
affects nearly every community in our
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
state including my home community of
 
04:03:57.429 --> 04:03:57.439 align:start position:0%
Claremont and a crisis that is now
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
causing much anxiety and suffering for
 
04:04:03.149 --> 04:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
especially our most vulnerable citizens
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
who cannot afford the higher rents that
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
have risen over the past few years on
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
affordability that has resulted in
 
04:04:12.429 --> 04:04:12.439 align:start position:0%
increased demands for housing assistance
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
and homelessness in many of our
 
04:04:17.229 --> 04:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
communities including including again
 
04:04:19.950 --> 04:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
Claremont a crisis which is discouraging
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
younger individuals younger families and
 
04:04:24.830 --> 04:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
even businesses from relocating to the
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
Granite State a crisis which has develop
 
04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
exacerbated the state's present labor
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
shortage and threatens our economic
 
04:04:36.510 --> 04:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
future frankly I believe there are many
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
ways to deal with this crisis
 
04:04:40.910 --> 04:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
but as many of you are beginning to
 
04:04:43.149 --> 04:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
understand by now the best way to
 
04:04:45.030 --> 04:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
alleviate and eventually solve the
 
04:04:47.910 --> 04:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
crisis is to Simply construct more new
 
04:04:51.630 --> 04:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
housing units or renovate for example uh
 
04:04:53.910 --> 04:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bulletin and its April
 
04:04:57.590 --> 04:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
27 2023 Edition cited the New Hampshire
 
04:04:59.229 --> 04:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
Housing Authority as indicating the
 
04:05:01.389 --> 04:05:01.399 align:start position:0%
state will need to construct at least
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
90,000 new housing units by 2040 to meet
 
04:05:08.590 --> 04:05:08.600 align:start position:0%
current demand for affordable housing uh
 
04:05:11.149 --> 04:05:11.159 align:start position:0%
this translates into approximately
 
04:05:13.750 --> 04:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
5,295 units per year from
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
2023 through 2040 according to my
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
math In fairness I am noticing that
 
04:05:24.349 --> 04:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
small steps are now being taken in our
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
state to deal with the crisis in
 
04:05:28.349 --> 04:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
Claremont I noticed more landlords are
 
04:05:30.670 --> 04:05:30.680 align:start position:0%
beginning to renovate substandard
 
04:05:33.110 --> 04:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings in order to create
 
04:05:33.120 --> 04:05:34.349 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings in order to create
more

04:05:34.349 --> 04:05:34.359 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:05:36.750 --> 04:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Apartments as for our state government
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
the invest New Hampshire State housing a
 
04:05:41.149 --> 04:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
program launched in 2022 by the governor
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
is beginning uh the construction of new
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
housing units all over the state and
 
04:05:48.149 --> 04:05:48.159 align:start position:0%
it's beginning to pay off the extra
 
04:05:50.070 --> 04:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
money included in last year's final
 
04:05:52.110 --> 04:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
version of the bipartisan operating
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
budget is also
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
helpful but I believe state government
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
can do more I really think they can do
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
more and House Bill 1545 is yet another
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
way to build more affordable housing
 
04:06:08.229 --> 04:06:08.239 align:start position:0%
units House Bill 1545 is written would
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
allow sizable areas of State Surplus
 
04:06:13.269 --> 04:06:13.279 align:start position:0%
property because I'm going to be frank
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
with you from my experience uh on the
 
04:06:17.750 --> 04:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
long range Capital planning utilization
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
committee a lot of the property is is
 
04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
not very large but there are I'm sure a
 
04:06:24.630 --> 04:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
l some large tracks out there whether
 
04:06:26.790 --> 04:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
open land or empty buildings in the
 
04:06:26.800 --> 04:06:28.070 align:start position:0%
open land or empty buildings in the
right

04:06:28.070 --> 04:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:06:29.990 --> 04:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh to be used for
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
affordable housing if a nonprofit
 
04:06:34.030 --> 04:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
organization was willing to construct
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
such housing and the local communities
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
in which the Surplus property was loc
 
04:06:41.550 --> 04:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
were located were supportive because I
 
04:06:42.990 --> 04:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
know that's very important the
 
04:06:44.830 --> 04:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
community's got to be supportive in
 
04:06:46.870 --> 04:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
exchange the state with the ultimate
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
approval of the governor and
 
04:06:51.990 --> 04:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
councel uh could sell or lease the
 
04:06:54.189 --> 04:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
Surplus properties to the nonprofits at
 
04:06:56.070 --> 04:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
less than fair market
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
value and I want to emphasize that house
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill 1545 would not directly cost our
 
04:07:05.950 --> 04:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
state any money not a dime but the state
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
would simply could would simply get a
 
04:07:11.149 --> 04:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
reduced price in Surplus property sales
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
if the if such properties are sold to
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate nonprofit individuals at
 
04:07:17.910 --> 04:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
less than fair market value I want to
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
emphasize that there is no as I see it
 
04:07:23.710 --> 04:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
no direct State cost also I want to
 
04:07:25.990 --> 04:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize that this bill does not
 
04:07:28.590 --> 04:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
preclude the state from selling State
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
Property Surplus property for housing to
 
04:07:33.590 --> 04:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
private entities at full market value
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
that is still a possibility in other
 
04:07:38.429 --> 04:07:38.439 align:start position:0%
words because the word May is in the
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
Bill's text it is only enabling or
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
legislation according to my uh
 
04:07:48.030 --> 04:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
understanding in conclusion I'd be more
 
04:07:49.670 --> 04:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
than happy to work with this committee
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
on any helpful amendments because I know
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
there's some con I've heard some some
 
04:07:55.109 --> 04:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
concerns from some people already to
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:07:59.630 --> 04:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
1545 but I request that you all
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
eventually give this bill a positive
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation in some form so that our
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
state has another tool in its toolbox to
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
combat its affordable housing crisis
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time and
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
listening and I will do my best to
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
answer questions thank you
 
04:08:20.590 --> 04:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
representative leus thank you um I'd
 
04:08:22.510 --> 04:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
like you to explain your your statement
 
04:08:24.070 --> 04:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
that this isn't going to cost anything
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
giving that money's fungible I don't
 
04:08:28.269 --> 04:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
can't see how there's any difference
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
between foregoing re you know money
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
coming in and spending extra money I I
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't see any difference what difference
 
04:08:37.750 --> 04:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
is there okay well in In fairness and
 
04:08:40.710 --> 04:08:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm On One Step I we talk the ultimately
 
04:08:42.109 --> 04:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
is the government councel but I'm on the
 
04:08:44.309 --> 04:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
long range Capital planning utilization
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
committee I've been in there for some
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
time and we're before it goes to
 
04:08:50.189 --> 04:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
governor and counsel the state agencies
 
04:08:52.830 --> 04:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
who are selling Surplus Pro have to come
 
04:08:55.950 --> 04:08:55.960 align:start position:0%
to us and we have to decide whether it's
 
04:08:58.109 --> 04:08:58.119 align:start position:0%
their requests are reasonable to sell it
 
04:09:00.590 --> 04:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
at full market value and believe
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
me property we deal with with property
 
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
values all the time and property values
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
go up and property values go down so
 
04:09:12.830 --> 04:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
well there may be no I mean it's not a
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
direct cost in the sense of an
 
04:09:16.990 --> 04:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation you know but it's property
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
that goes up according to the for the
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
for the free market and this is
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
something so this bill would simply in
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
the right circumstances we could give a
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit or a break in the in the
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
sale so I guess it does cost some money
 
04:09:35.790 --> 04:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
but to put a a fiscal note on it I just
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
can't say because this is an basically
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation and I feel it's the
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
right circumstances a piece of open land
 
04:09:46.030 --> 04:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
or a piece a state empty State Building
 
04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
might be available for if a a a
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
nonprofit came along to make create it
 
04:09:53.910 --> 04:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
into Surplus housing all right thank you
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
so I don't hopefully that helps answer
 
04:09:55.479 --> 04:09:56.309 align:start position:0%
so I don't hopefully that helps answer
your

04:09:56.309 --> 04:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:09:58.750 --> 04:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
question represent
 
04:10:02.109 --> 04:10:02.119 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair in the uh
 
04:10:03.550 --> 04:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
04:10:08.990 --> 04:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
question um in the um definition of of
 
04:10:12.510 --> 04:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
stle property I am I correct to assume
 
04:10:15.269 --> 04:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
this is real property and not trucks and
 
04:10:17.630 --> 04:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
cars and things right it is nothing to
 
04:10:20.229 --> 04:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
do with it is either open land or
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
buildings basically thank you thank
 
04:10:25.389 --> 04:10:25.399 align:start position:0%
represent Simon thank you madam chair
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony oh you're
 
04:10:29.269 --> 04:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
welcome um you made reference in your
 
04:10:31.670 --> 04:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
testimony to the fact that loc
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have a say over
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not they wanted the
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
development to take
 
04:10:38.229 --> 04:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
place um I'm just looking at the bill
 
04:10:40.309 --> 04:10:40.319 align:start position:0%
itself and the reference statutes I'm
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
not seeing that anywhere is there some
 
04:10:44.229 --> 04:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
place that you were pointing to to say
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
that that was the case or would we have
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
to okay and and I I just want of course
 
04:10:49.389 --> 04:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know communities are different I
 
04:10:51.670 --> 04:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
think some of them have Planning and
 
04:10:53.670 --> 04:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
Zoning maybe some of them don't and and
 
04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
depending on where the the Surplus
 
04:10:57.309 --> 04:10:57.319 align:start position:0%
property was located in which community
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
that their local Planning and Zoning
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
statute might govern if if they have
 
04:11:03.389 --> 04:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
them so maybe I I have to be a little
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
bit more careful but I'm just trying to
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
cover every situation and
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
not uh try to mislead this committee
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
saying it's it's it's an automatic thing
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
that if there's Surplus property
 
04:11:16.469 --> 04:11:16.479 align:start position:0%
available in a nonprofit wanted to do it
 
04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
they could get it they'd probably have
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
to work with the local community because
 
04:11:21.710 --> 04:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
without the local community support I
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
have a feeling that wouldn't go through
 
04:11:24.670 --> 04:11:24.680 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
end thank you okay thank you represent
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
man py thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:11:32.910 --> 04:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
does this also address that a lot of Old
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
Mill buildings and D capitated buildings
 
04:11:40.510 --> 04:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
that could be partly owned by state
 
04:11:43.229 --> 04:11:43.239 align:start position:0%
partly owned by local municipalities or
 
04:11:43.239 --> 04:11:45.229 align:start position:0%
partly owned by local municipalities or
local

04:11:45.229 --> 04:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
communities in that case how would that
 
04:11:52.189 --> 04:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
work well and it it mainly is Surplus
 
04:11:54.550 --> 04:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
State Property that's my intent now
 
04:11:56.229 --> 04:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
there might be situations I don't know
 
04:11:58.030 --> 04:11:58.040 align:start position:0%
whether where it's maybe owned by a
 
04:11:59.870 --> 04:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
municipality and actually that brings me
 
04:12:01.149 --> 04:12:01.159 align:start position:0%
up I know I was talking with my
 
04:12:03.429 --> 04:12:03.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues about this legislation and
 
04:12:05.229 --> 04:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
she thought it was a good idea and she
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
thought well why don't our munic
 
04:12:09.349 --> 04:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions also do the same
 
04:12:10.790 --> 04:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
thing because I'm sure some of them have
 
04:12:13.070 --> 04:12:13.080 align:start position:0%
some Surplus state property and that's
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's not my intent with this bill but
 
04:12:17.229 --> 04:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
if this inspires some of our political
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
subdivisions municipalities counties
 
04:12:22.870 --> 04:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
school districts Etc more power to them
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
because I think we've got to use all the
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
tools that we can to solve this crisis
 
04:12:30.229 --> 04:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
and government along with the PRI the
 
04:12:31.790 --> 04:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
private sector obviously is probably
 
04:12:33.990 --> 04:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
going to take the load but if Government
 
04:12:36.790 --> 04:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
can work with the private sector to to
 
04:12:39.870 --> 04:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
create help build more housing I think
 
04:12:41.389 --> 04:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
in theot that's the way we're going to
 
04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
get out of this in my opinion ultimately
 
04:12:44.630 --> 04:12:44.640 align:start position:0%
we can deal with some of the side
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
effects but we've got to build more
 
04:12:49.630 --> 04:12:49.640 align:start position:0%
housing in order to solve this crisis
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's my opinion thank you
 
04:12:54.030 --> 04:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
representative CER thank you um
 
04:12:56.109 --> 04:12:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative cluder you may have
 
04:12:59.109 --> 04:12:59.119 align:start position:0%
covered this before and I apologize if I
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
missed what you
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
said could you just quickly go over what
 
04:13:03.680 --> 04:13:04.710 align:start position:0%
said could you just quickly go over what
the

04:13:04.710 --> 04:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
standard selling a state Sur plus
 
04:13:10.349 --> 04:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
property is and how would this be
 
04:13:12.030 --> 04:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
different does this change the process
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
at all it it it um it would not I mean
 
04:13:18.870 --> 04:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
my intent and I have the law it just
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
basically would add a a as a section and
 
04:13:26.790 --> 04:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
if you read the text of the bill it
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
would add add a text that the
 
04:13:31.630 --> 04:13:31.640 align:start position:0%
the ultimately the governor and Council
 
04:13:34.149 --> 04:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
and there's a process would would be
 
04:13:36.030 --> 04:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
able to sell it
 
04:13:39.510 --> 04:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
without uh uh at less than fair market
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
value and I think it's it's RSA
 
04:13:46.189 --> 04:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
440 and it would
 
04:13:49.750 --> 04:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
amend uh yes I see what you're saying
 
04:13:52.269 --> 04:13:52.279 align:start position:0%
par it would add another one under Roman
 
04:13:55.830 --> 04:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 it would Roman numeral B where
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
right now you they we
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
basically ultimately the governor and
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
counsel but it's also the long range
 
04:14:03.910 --> 04:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
committee has to if there's any surplus
 
04:14:06.109 --> 04:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
State Property normally they're supposed
 
04:14:09.309 --> 04:14:09.319 align:start position:0%
to sell it at fair at fair market value
 
04:14:11.229 --> 04:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
or you know and that's what we've tried
 
04:14:11.239 --> 04:14:11.990 align:start position:0%
or you know and that's what we've tried
to

04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:16.109 --> 04:14:16.119 align:start position:0%
do uh you know but of course Market real
 
04:14:18.429 --> 04:14:18.439 align:start position:0%
estate values go up and go down and
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
obviously the intent of our committee
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
especially if we're selling to a private
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
entity is get the full fair market value
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
to reimburse see this covers all Sur
 
04:14:29.149 --> 04:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
whether it's highway highway Surplus
 
04:14:31.950 --> 04:14:31.960 align:start position:0%
property or general to get full fair
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
market to reimburse some of the state
 
04:14:35.830 --> 04:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
costs and in the case of Highway you've
 
04:14:37.830 --> 04:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
also got sometimes you have to reimburse
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government if it's a project
 
04:14:42.750 --> 04:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
that the federal money has been used uh
 
04:14:45.990 --> 04:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's the intent and I just want to
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
give a nonprofit who are willing to
 
04:14:50.550 --> 04:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
create it's it's an incentive they would
 
04:14:53.109 --> 04:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
get a break on the sale an exchange they
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
they build affordable housing whether
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's open land or empty state buildings
 
04:14:59.750 --> 04:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that's the intent of this Bill
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you hopefully that help okay thank
 
04:15:04.469 --> 04:15:04.479 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
questions represent Goldie
 
04:15:09.630 --> 04:15:09.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:15:12.830 --> 04:15:12.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question you're welcome
 
04:15:15.510 --> 04:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
um I look at and you discussed it
 
04:15:19.870 --> 04:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
earlier as to cities and towns zoning
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not housing is
 
04:15:24.990 --> 04:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
available for those
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
positions what
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
happens if a nonprofit purchase a
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
purchases this piece of
 
04:15:33.199 --> 04:15:34.750 align:start position:0%
purchases this piece of
property

04:15:34.750 --> 04:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:15:37.910 --> 04:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden it's deemed that
 
04:15:42.109 --> 04:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's unable to build these housing units
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
what happens then other words I I'm
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
going to assume and that the non does
 
04:15:51.590 --> 04:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
due diligence and confers with the with
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
the municipality where the Surplus
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
property or is located first in order to
 
04:15:59.070 --> 04:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
make sure they're on board uh before
 
04:16:00.510 --> 04:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
going through with the purchase I would
 
04:16:03.429 --> 04:16:03.439 align:start position:0%
think any nonprofit if they wanted to do
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
this project they would seek the input
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
of of the municipality in order for this
 
04:16:11.510 --> 04:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
go through because if the municipality
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
objected there could be a real problem
 
04:16:16.910 --> 04:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh they could deny and I don't Z
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
planning and zoning laws I mean the sale
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
could go through but hey if they can't
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
get the necessary permits there's a
 
04:16:24.630 --> 04:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
there's a probably the the Ser uh
 
04:16:26.830 --> 04:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing wouldn't be
 
04:16:30.590 --> 04:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
erected I and that could very easily
 
04:16:34.950 --> 04:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
happen if the developer talks to
 
04:16:37.710 --> 04:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
Town manager for example and then some a
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
group of agreed citizens put a warrant
 
04:16:45.389 --> 04:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
article through changing the zoning of
 
04:16:46.349 --> 04:16:46.359 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:16:49.910 --> 04:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
parcel which has been known to happen
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
right and I I mean I would think
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
everything the nonprofit working would
 
04:16:56.469 --> 04:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
have to line every get the community on
 
04:17:00.429 --> 04:17:00.439 align:start position:0%
board first before per uh you know
 
04:17:02.309 --> 04:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
purchasing this otherwise I don't think
 
04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
they would go through that without
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
Community Support that would be sort of
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
my Common Sense on understanding but yes
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
bill what represent black us yeah I I
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
think if you look at the last and let me
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
know if if if you look at the last
 
04:17:20.750 --> 04:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
sentence it says it'll be conveyed with
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
necessary covenants and restrictions so
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
it'll use for that purpose but what what
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
isn't clear is if they are unable to use
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
it for that purpose then what happens
 
04:17:30.750 --> 04:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that needs to be clear so
 
04:17:32.429 --> 04:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
other words if the nonp purchased it and
 
04:17:34.109 --> 04:17:34.119 align:start position:0%
there were some restrictions or and then
 
04:17:36.030 --> 04:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
they weren't allowed to build well and
 
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
then then this then probably they
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't wouldn't be allowed to build uh
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
but I'd be willing you know as I said
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is as I understand the language but
 
04:17:45.750 --> 04:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
as I said I'm open to a to any helpful
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendments if that would help clarify
 
04:17:50.149 --> 04:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
the intent of this Bill thank you
 
04:17:54.510 --> 04:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
represent Brown thank you madam chair um
 
04:17:57.149 --> 04:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
is there any uh priority thought of a
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
priority list if there's a nonprofit and
 
04:18:00.429 --> 04:18:00.439 align:start position:0%
a private entity that want the same
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
property we'll read that again if I
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
guess if an if a if a private entity
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
wanted to create affordable housing
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
they'd go through the same process and
 
04:18:13.910 --> 04:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
they if they were willing to pay full
 
04:18:15.750 --> 04:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
market value I guess it would be the
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
Judgment of the long range committee and
 
04:18:20.550 --> 04:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
the end the government Judgment of the
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
governor and counsel and because this
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is not mandate any it's it's uh or
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
as I see it it is uh enabling
 
04:18:33.030 --> 04:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislation only uh and it does not stop
 
04:18:36.990 --> 04:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh the state from selling to a uh a a
 
04:18:38.710 --> 04:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
prep business if they whether it's
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
affordable housing or anything else as I
 
04:18:43.229 --> 04:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
understand the bill that I've
 
04:18:47.149 --> 04:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
drafted thank you other questions thank
 
04:18:49.149 --> 04:18:49.159 align:start position:0%

Ben Frost I'm the deputy executive
 
04:19:20.109 --> 04:19:20.119 align:start position:0%
director for New Hampshire housing um
 
04:19:21.870 --> 04:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
speaking in support of this legislation
 
04:19:23.710 --> 04:19:23.720 align:start position:0%
I want to thank representative cier for
 
04:19:26.349 --> 04:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
introducing it I indicated uh support
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
with Amendment and um he he averred to
 
04:19:32.990 --> 04:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh a alluded to a a you know possible
 
04:19:35.710 --> 04:19:35.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I I have worked to draft
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
something and would be happy happy to
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
share that with the committee
 
04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
um one of the concern well let me let me
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
back up the um New Hampshire housing as
 
04:19:51.189 --> 04:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
a state entity uh not an agency but an
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
instrumentality of state government has
 
04:19:56.189 --> 04:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
the statutory ability to acquire uh
 
04:19:59.070 --> 04:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus State Property uh essentially to
 
04:20:02.830 --> 04:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
assert a preemptive right to do so uh
 
04:20:06.910 --> 04:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
and that is pursuant to existing statute
 
04:20:09.990 --> 04:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and we can do that um and we have
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
done this a few times and we're
 
04:20:13.870 --> 04:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
currently engaged with the Department of
 
04:20:16.189 --> 04:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
Transportation on a couple of parcels of
 
04:20:19.510 --> 04:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
land uh that we will then put out to
 
04:20:21.790 --> 04:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
development for affordable housing not
 
04:20:25.349 --> 04:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily for nonprofit uh developers
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
but any for-profit or nonprofit would be
 
04:20:31.590 --> 04:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to um compete for the
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to develop those properties
 
04:20:37.510 --> 04:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
this bill um gives would give us
 
04:20:39.790 --> 04:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
essentially a leg up because right now
 
04:20:42.109 --> 04:20:42.119 align:start position:0%
we're paying fair market value for this
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Surplus properties coming from dot
 
04:20:47.109 --> 04:20:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh this would provide the opportunity
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
for us to acquire properties um
 
04:20:53.790 --> 04:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
potentially from the the the state at
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
less than fair market value which
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
savings we could then pass on to a
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
developer who could then make a
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
development more affordable whether they
 
04:21:05.309 --> 04:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
are for-profit or nonprofit this however
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
is limited to uh
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofits um I'll point out a couple of
 
04:21:13.670 --> 04:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
things that would be of concern to me uh
 
04:21:16.590 --> 04:21:16.600 align:start position:0%
as written uh this legislation if
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
adopted uh would put the state
 
04:21:21.630 --> 04:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
effectively into the position of being a
 
04:21:21.640 --> 04:21:22.790 align:start position:0%
effectively into the position of being a
project

04:21:22.790 --> 04:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
underwriter and also the long-term asset
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
manager of the properties ensuring that
 
04:21:32.550 --> 04:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
once built uh that it continues to be
 
04:21:35.550 --> 04:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
used for the purposes for which uh it
 
04:21:38.149 --> 04:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
was intended as when sold by the state
 
04:21:40.229 --> 04:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
and I I'm not sure that is a position
 
04:21:43.630 --> 04:21:43.640 align:start position:0%
the state wants to be in I would say
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
however that that is the position that
 
04:21:49.349 --> 04:21:49.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing does already serve
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
um and so the an amendment that I would
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
suggest would refer to existing statute
 
04:21:56.040 --> 04:21:57.229 align:start position:0%
suggest would refer to existing statute
RSA

04:21:57.229 --> 04:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:22:00.429 --> 04:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
204d which is the Surplus land statute
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
for the state which puts New Hampshire
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
housing in the position of acquiring
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
property from the state here if it were
 
04:22:11.790 --> 04:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
done under the condition that it be
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
transferred to a nonprofit organization
 
04:22:17.550 --> 04:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
to build affordable housing then uh the
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
state agency would be and and frankly
 
04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
long range would also be enabled to uh
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
dispose of the property at less than
 
04:22:27.030 --> 04:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
fair market value those are savings
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
again that we could pass on to uh a
 
04:22:33.269 --> 04:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
developer say that number again that is
 
04:22:33.279 --> 04:22:34.870 align:start position:0%
developer say that number again that is
RSA

04:22:34.870 --> 04:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
04:22:40.189 --> 04:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
204d 204 or hyphen D um so I have uh
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
drafted a drafty Amendment uh that would
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
achieve that purpose there may be
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
something else that needs to be done
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
with that um but thank you if you pass
 
04:22:51.389 --> 04:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
it out we will consider it I will be
 
04:22:53.510 --> 04:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
happy to pass it around happy to take
 
04:22:56.910 --> 04:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
any questions too okay so if if I
 
04:22:58.950 --> 04:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly you're saying
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire housing already has
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
the authority to obtain Surplus
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
land resell it to at whatever you can
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
get to a developer for affordable
 
04:23:14.510 --> 04:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
housing or any other purpose of other
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
housing purposes we only do affordable
 
04:23:19.429 --> 04:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
housing there are some situations where
 
04:23:21.429 --> 04:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
we there might be mixed income housing
 
04:23:23.349 --> 04:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
but the focus is always affordable
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
housing with that definition as noted in
 
04:23:28.630 --> 04:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
the legislation in RSA
 
04:23:28.640 --> 04:23:30.510 align:start position:0%
the legislation in RSA
204c

04:23:30.510 --> 04:23:30.520 align:start position:0%
204c
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
561 okay and your statute and rules of
 
04:23:39.109 --> 04:23:39.119 align:start position:0%
deal with what happens if the zoning
 
04:23:41.950 --> 04:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
changes or or
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
whatever well it it to the extent I was
 
04:23:47.389 --> 04:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
able to to follow the question before um
 
04:23:51.189 --> 04:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
it we would really be interested in
 
04:23:54.149 --> 04:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
acquiring property uh where there is
 
04:23:55.750 --> 04:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
development potential and that's what
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now in our
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the Department of
 
04:24:00.910 --> 04:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation uh so we're working with
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
the department and we're working with
 
04:24:05.269 --> 04:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
the municipality uh where the property
 
04:24:09.149 --> 04:24:09.159 align:start position:0%
is situated uh so we look for uh
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
situations where the existing zoning
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
permits what we're trying to do uh we we
 
04:24:18.469 --> 04:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
have no real interest in in bucking the
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
municipal regulatory process um we don't
 
04:24:26.630 --> 04:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
have the the ability to frankly um if if
 
04:24:31.149 --> 04:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
a um development were TR or if property
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
were transferred to us and then the
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
zoning changed well then we'd have to
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
probably sell it to someone who could
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
use the property for the properly zoned
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you represent Simon thank
 
04:24:47.550 --> 04:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um in your testimony you
 
04:24:48.790 --> 04:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
said that you felt like one of the
 
04:24:50.910 --> 04:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
benefits of this was you that you would
 
04:24:52.990 --> 04:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
be able to um acquire the property at a
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
lower rate and therefore pass it on to a
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
developer at a lower rate which would
 
04:24:58.750 --> 04:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
allow them to create more affordable
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
housing which I'm assuming is the really
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
the entire purpose of the bill but is
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
there any guarantee that by passing the
 
04:25:07.950 --> 04:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
property on at a lower rate it will in
 
04:25:11.030 --> 04:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
fact turn into cheaper housing what
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
would keep the developer from keeping
 
04:25:14.670 --> 04:25:14.680 align:start position:0%
the rates at the higher level but just
 
04:25:17.309 --> 04:25:17.319 align:start position:0%
acquiring the property at a lower
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
level that's a great question
 
04:25:22.590 --> 04:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
representative um and it really comes
 
04:25:25.229 --> 04:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
back leans back on our processes at New
 
04:25:28.189 --> 04:25:28.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing that's our purpose for
 
04:25:30.389 --> 04:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
existing is to develop affordable
 
04:25:32.030 --> 04:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
housing and we're not interested in
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
working with developers who uh frankly
 
04:25:38.389 --> 04:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
aren't going to do that and we impose
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
long-term guarantees that are legally
 
04:25:43.389 --> 04:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
enforcable uh that include the ability
 
04:25:45.469 --> 04:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
to foreclose on the properties if
 
04:25:48.670 --> 04:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
they're uh not meeting the the required
 
04:25:51.469 --> 04:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
conditions and Covenants great thank you
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
represent man py thank you madam chair
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um when
 
04:26:02.870 --> 04:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
you acquir the Housing Authority does do
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
the due diligence in terms of uh wetland
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
land conservation land all those things
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
what is the develop developable
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
developable parcel of land
 
04:26:19.950 --> 04:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
correct follow question yeah so when you
 
04:26:23.309 --> 04:26:23.319 align:start position:0%
say affordable housing what are the
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
different categories lowincome Workforce
 
04:26:26.080 --> 04:26:26.990 align:start position:0%
different categories lowincome Workforce
missing

04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
missing
 
04:26:31.510 --> 04:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
mle or what other categories Does it
 
04:26:33.910 --> 04:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
include uh thank you for the question
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
representative if you refer to the the
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
the statutes cited in the bill uh that
 
04:26:41.590 --> 04:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
takes you essentially to a definition or
 
04:26:44.950 --> 04:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
a series of definitions that include um
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
low income housing which is housing uh
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
or moderate income housing which is
 
04:26:51.030 --> 04:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
housing that is Affordable to people
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
making up to 80% of median income low
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
income housing which is uh 60% of median
 
04:26:59.950 --> 04:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
income very low-income housing which is
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
50% of median income those are all
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
included in our statute and that's
 
04:27:07.309 --> 04:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's embodied in this
 
04:27:10.990 --> 04:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
Bill okay representative Simon thank you
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up question to my
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
previous one um you said that you do
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
have guarantees that they'll do what
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
they or you can foreclose um are those
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
guarantees in perpetuity or is there a
 
04:27:23.550 --> 04:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
limitation on them or how does that work
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
uh it thank you for the question the we
 
04:27:29.030 --> 04:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
um there are some legal barriers to
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
doing perpetuity um one of which is well
 
04:27:33.910 --> 04:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
not so much a legal barrier but a
 
04:27:34.950 --> 04:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
practical barrier and that is
 
04:27:37.149 --> 04:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
perpetuities are very long time and you
 
04:27:38.790 --> 04:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
don't know what the future may bring we
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
do impose long-term restrictions um and
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
it depending upon the the source of
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
funding of something U then it might
 
04:27:53.349 --> 04:27:53.359 align:start position:0%
be absolute minimum of 20 years of
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
affordability and that's in the
 
04:27:57.229 --> 04:27:57.239 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund statute uh the
 
04:27:59.590 --> 04:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
federal funding that we utilize and is
 
04:28:02.309 --> 04:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
utilized by developers that we work with
 
04:28:06.550 --> 04:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
tends to require 30 uh minimum 30 years
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
of affordability but we often push that
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
up up to 40 or 60 years of affordability
 
04:28:15.429 --> 04:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
and we are in the process right now of
 
04:28:17.790 --> 04:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
changing one of our rules that would
 
04:28:19.990 --> 04:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
allow us to move up to 75 years of
 
04:28:22.030 --> 04:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
affordability which is a pretty long
 
04:28:25.429 --> 04:28:25.439 align:start position:0%
time thank you yes by then you'll have
 
04:28:27.670 --> 04:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
to rebuild the
 
04:28:31.590 --> 04:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
housing at probably sooner than 75 years
 
04:28:33.229 --> 04:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
they they tend to require
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
recapitalization 20 or 30 years out
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
ah thank you that's good to know and
 
04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you madam
 
04:28:42.389 --> 04:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Ben for taking my
 
04:28:44.830 --> 04:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
question you had mentioned that right
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
now currently the Housing Authority has
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
the option to buy at market value
 
04:28:53.030 --> 04:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
Surplus property correct correct and is
 
04:28:56.750 --> 04:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
that limited to you and no other
 
04:29:01.269 --> 04:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
nonprofit the statutes allow for both a
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
a municipality in which the property is
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
situated and New Hampshire housing
 
04:29:09.870 --> 04:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
effectively we have competing preemptive
 
04:29:12.710 --> 04:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
rights um and we generally you know if
 
04:29:14.269 --> 04:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
the municipality wants to acquire it we
 
04:29:17.030 --> 04:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
step back and let them do that
 
04:29:19.950 --> 04:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
um but right now and I'm I don't want to
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
say the T what the town is because there
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
are some negotiations going on but uh in
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
this place where we're acquiring
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
properties from the Department of
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation the town is taken a pass
 
04:29:33.189 --> 04:29:33.199 align:start position:0%
and they're supportive of what we're
 
04:29:36.349 --> 04:29:36.359 align:start position:0%
trying to do which is very helpful uh
 
04:29:40.109 --> 04:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
so we have that um statutory tension
 
04:29:42.109 --> 04:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
between the two that we we are living
 
04:29:46.429 --> 04:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
with uh comfortably um depending upon
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
which depending upon how the state
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
acquired property uh what source of
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
funding was used does guide and
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes require how the state will
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
then dispose of it once it once it
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
becomes Surplus uh this bill helps uh
 
04:30:06.750 --> 04:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
with some of those strictures follow
 
04:30:09.550 --> 04:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
follow and so am I thank you for that
 
04:30:11.710 --> 04:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
answer am I understanding correctly that
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would also open up the
 
04:30:17.309 --> 04:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity to other nonprofits besides
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing to obtain the
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
property directly from the state yes and
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
and that's a really excellent question
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
because right now this says to be quite
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
to be transferred to a
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
nonprofit We are not a nonprofit
 
04:30:36.070 --> 04:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization we're an instrumental it of
 
04:30:38.990 --> 04:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
state government so this essentially
 
04:30:42.630 --> 04:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
takes us out of the picture and is in
 
04:30:46.510 --> 04:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with RSA 204d which gives us a
 
04:30:49.950 --> 04:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
preemptive right so this as introduced
 
04:30:52.189 --> 04:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
there is a statutory conflict I have an
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that would help to resolve
 
04:30:56.670 --> 04:30:56.680 align:start position:0%
that but the conflict is only if you if
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the less than fair
 
04:30:58.760 --> 04:31:01.109 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the less than fair
market

04:31:01.109 --> 04:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
value okay thank you I thought any other
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:06.349 align:start position:0%
value okay thank you I thought any other
questions

04:31:06.349 --> 04:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:31:08.070 --> 04:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony we will
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Amendment and I will
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
pass it out right now thank you thank
 
04:31:13.269 --> 04:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to
 
04:31:16.750 --> 04:31:16.760 align:start position:0%

okay
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
anything thank you madam chair I'm
 
04:31:53.189 --> 04:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
Jackie groa representative for District
 
04:31:55.469 --> 04:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
24 the towns of Ryan
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
Greenland this amendment has a little
 
04:32:01.750 --> 04:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a history in that it um reflects
 
04:32:04.269 --> 04:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
the changes that were made last year
 
04:32:08.510 --> 04:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 6 35 540 some of the
 
04:32:12.670 --> 04:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
changes in House Bill 2 that we accepted
 
04:32:14.309 --> 04:32:14.319 align:start position:0%
and it looks like a
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
lot and originally was going to be an
 
04:32:21.309 --> 04:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that we were going to look at
 
04:32:24.109 --> 04:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
um last year but we didn't have time for
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
that and then the Senate was going to
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
take it up as a bill but OS had a hard
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
time trying to jiggle into their
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
schedule so we took it back as an
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and you'll look at through
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
most most of it you'll see that board is
 
04:32:40.349 --> 04:32:40.359 align:start position:0%
replaced by the
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
office and there's the addition of RSA
 
04:32:47.550 --> 04:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
310 which is the RSA that defines the
 
04:32:50.189 --> 04:32:50.199 align:start position:0%
responsibility of of the um
 
04:32:53.790 --> 04:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
oplc there are other things in here but
 
04:32:56.590 --> 04:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
the most of it it really has to do with
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
all the changes that we made and I might
 
04:33:01.990 --> 04:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that rather than we addressing
 
04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
it here we we could go at we can go at
 
04:33:07.869 --> 04:33:07.879 align:start position:0%
it in a subcommittee and willing to sit
 
04:33:09.990 --> 04:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
through some of the concerns and some of
 
04:33:12.070 --> 04:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
the questions that people may have does
 
04:33:15.551 --> 04:33:15.561 align:start position:0%
that make sense makes sense to me and if
 
04:33:17.830 --> 04:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
you you could give it to me to
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
save dear representative luckus from yet
 
04:33:23.310 --> 04:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
another bill in a
 
04:33:26.590 --> 04:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee thank you he may have made
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
a comment earlier about
 
04:33:33.551 --> 04:33:33.561 align:start position:0%
that okay very good any any questions uh
 
04:33:36.910 --> 04:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and
 
04:33:42.789 --> 04:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand the process of where
 
04:33:42.799 --> 04:33:44.070 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand the process of where
we're

04:33:44.070 --> 04:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
04:33:48.429 --> 04:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
at but I just first of all very
 
04:33:51.709 --> 04:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
disappointed to get 112 page Amendment
 
04:33:53.269 --> 04:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like this is getting to be a
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
norm here versus the proper procedure of
 
04:33:58.949 --> 04:33:58.959 align:start position:0%
coming in as legislation or dividing it
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
up into separate sections um so that we
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
have smaller pieces to handle going
 
04:34:06.230 --> 04:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
forward I'm glad to hear you're willing
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
to take it on but it's while it changes
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
board and oplc and a lot there's awful
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
lot of repeals in here that I'm seeing
 
04:34:16.189 --> 04:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
as well that I think should be going
 
04:34:19.390 --> 04:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
through line by line and I'm not sure we
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
really have the time to go through 112
 
04:34:22.869 --> 04:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
pages of looking all the repeals and
 
04:34:25.269 --> 04:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
actually pulling them up um as we go
 
04:34:28.629 --> 04:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
forward but I'm hoping you're
 
04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
willing with the subcommittee and the
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
work of this committee to do the due
 
04:34:34.070 --> 04:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
diligence before going forward with this
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
and if we have to inm study it and come
 
04:34:38.109 --> 04:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
back next year
 
04:34:43.390 --> 04:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
because this is crazy to put it bluntly
 
04:34:45.551 --> 04:34:45.561 align:start position:0%
I agree about this being here now this
 
04:34:46.709 --> 04:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
late in the
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
hour take I understand I will take that
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility any other
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
04:34:58.390 --> 04:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
and also a lot of pink card appreciate
 
04:35:04.189 --> 04:35:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.199 --> 04:35:12.470 align:start position:0%

04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
04:35:15.709 --> 04:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Karen Susi I work
 
04:35:17.470 --> 04:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
at she andin Capital group and I'm here
 
04:35:18.629 --> 04:35:18.639 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association we are
 
04:35:22.750 --> 04:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
the uh representatives of the
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes Park owners
 
04:35:27.429 --> 04:35:27.439 align:start position:0%
installers Etc everything in the
 
04:35:31.189 --> 04:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
industry um just focusing in particular
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
on page 92 of the amendment Line 6
 
04:35:36.080 --> 04:35:36.949 align:start position:0%
on page 92 of the amendment Line 6
through

04:35:36.949 --> 04:35:36.959 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
8 it appears that uh the board of
 
04:35:44.470 --> 04:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is attempting to be
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:03.709 --> 04:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:06.789 --> 04:36:06.799 align:start position:0%
nine inert the reason behind repealing
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
that board was that it had not had any
 
04:36:11.470 --> 04:36:11.480 align:start position:0%
cases I believe for five or six years
 
04:36:14.269 --> 04:36:14.279 align:start position:0%
within its jurisdiction and that's why
 
04:36:15.789 --> 04:36:15.799 align:start position:0%
it was proposed to be
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
repealed okay thank you for bringing it
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
to our attention we'll we'll take a look
 
04:36:27.150 --> 04:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
Thompson perfect
 
04:36:34.080 --> 04:36:39.551 align:start position:0%
Thompson perfect
timing

04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:41.349 --> 04:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
always wanted to say this good morning
 
04:36:41.359 --> 04:36:46.029 align:start position:0%

04:36:46.029 --> 04:36:46.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:48.269 --> 04:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
Simon are you
 
04:36:51.150 --> 04:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
in oh did I say good morning I'm sorry
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Simon Thompson I'm
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
with Sheen finny Capital group here on
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
behalf of the electrical contractors
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
Business Association as representative
 
04:37:01.470 --> 04:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
goalie mentioned this is a very lengthy
 
04:37:02.789 --> 04:37:02.799 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm just going to draw your
 
04:37:06.029 --> 04:37:06.039 align:start position:0%
attention to page 77
 
04:37:13.510 --> 04:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
proposes line number uh starting on line
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
eight where it crosses out the board
 
04:37:22.349 --> 04:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
shall maintain and make available a list
 
04:37:24.470 --> 04:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
of such persons approved for level one
 
04:37:26.789 --> 04:37:26.799 align:start position:0%
and level two thirdparty electrical
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
inspections we would request that that
 
04:37:31.670 --> 04:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
language remain in the bill uh third
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
party inspectors are
 
04:37:37.949 --> 04:37:37.959 align:start position:0%
important uh to to the overall housing
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
kind of industry in that a lot of rural
 
04:37:42.910 --> 04:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
towns do not have uh their own
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
inspectors and so when a general
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
contractor or an electrician needs to
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
get their work inspected they need to
 
04:37:53.349 --> 04:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
have a place of reference to go to to um
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
call and find these uh qualified uh
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
approved thirdparty
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors um so we would wish that that
 
04:38:05.590 --> 04:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
would stay in the current RSA
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
further down um just one other point
 
04:38:13.070 --> 04:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
starting on line 20 that deletion uh
 
04:38:15.390 --> 04:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
again we would prefer that that stay in
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
the bill uh we would make one change if
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's helpful proof of completion shall
 
04:38:24.349 --> 04:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
be furnished to the board by the lensey
 
04:38:26.109 --> 04:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
period This is for when you do your
 
04:38:29.470 --> 04:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
continuing education um
 
04:38:34.510 --> 04:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
work uh that the board keeps a list of
 
04:38:35.750 --> 04:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
folks who've done their continuing
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
education so that we can at all times
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
know uh when an electrician is in good
 
04:38:44.189 --> 04:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
standing and furthermore the rest of
 
04:38:45.990 --> 04:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
that deletion failure to complete the
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
continuing education shall render the
 
04:38:50.390 --> 04:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
electric electrician license that whole
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
deletion we'd like to keep all of that
 
04:38:56.310 --> 04:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the RSA so those are the two uh
 
04:38:57.750 --> 04:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
issues that we wanted to bring to the
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
committee's attention happy to
 
04:39:01.429 --> 04:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
participate any the subcommittee work on
 
04:39:04.029 --> 04:39:04.039 align:start position:0%
this but again you know this is just one
 
04:39:06.551 --> 04:39:06.561 align:start position:0%
page of 12-page bill and we found kind
 
04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
of two issues that um really would like
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
to I don't think really had anything to
 
04:39:13.470 --> 04:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
do with any of the past legislation that
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
passed um so we just wanted to make sure
 
04:39:18.390 --> 04:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
those do remain happy to answer
 
04:39:19.789 --> 04:39:19.799 align:start position:0%
questions great thank you for your
 
04:39:23.869 --> 04:39:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions seeing on thank you very much
 
04:39:26.520 --> 04:39:27.349 align:start position:0%

requirements being prescribed by the um
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
office versus the council it's including
 
04:40:08.470 --> 04:40:08.480 align:start position:0%

about the technical skills being
 
04:40:27.270 --> 04:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
prescribed by the office and on 28 it's
 
04:40:29.550 --> 04:40:29.560 align:start position:0%

04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
duties and the um discipline duties and
 
04:40:54.430 --> 04:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
things like that which we understand is
 
04:40:57.150 --> 04:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
a done deal and that is um understood
 
04:41:00.550 --> 04:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and okay with us but these seem to
 
04:41:02.590 --> 04:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
overstep that and sort of come down to
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
the core values of what we do as our in
 
04:41:08.390 --> 04:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
our training and I'm just concerned that
 
04:41:10.110 --> 04:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
um if the office of Professional
 
04:41:12.990 --> 04:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
Licensing has um being able to prescribe
 
04:41:14.830 --> 04:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
how many prenatal visits we have to do
 
04:41:16.470 --> 04:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
before we get certified I don't think
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
they have the expertise and the
 
04:41:21.788 --> 04:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
understanding for that process and um
 
04:41:23.788 --> 04:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
you know I'd be happy to work with them
 
04:41:26.110 --> 04:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
and and help them understand that but at
 
04:41:28.750 --> 04:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
this point I'm concerned that they could
 
04:41:30.788 --> 04:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
come up with any number of anything that
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
they wanted and it essentially put us
 
04:41:34.750 --> 04:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
out of business if they chose to I don't
 
04:41:36.910 --> 04:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
think that's their intention but it does
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
make us
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um and then
 
04:41:48.590 --> 04:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
on page 34 on line um 13 it does give us
 
04:41:53.470 --> 04:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
the council um the mid refe Council um
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
being the ability to adopt the rules for
 
04:41:58.350 --> 04:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
qualifications and so I feel like we
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
we're adopting the rules for
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications and then on this line
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're having the oplc tell us what our
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
qualifications are are and that seems
 
04:42:09.230 --> 04:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
me any questions thank you for your
 
04:42:13.150 --> 04:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
testimony any questions from the
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
gold my understanding that the conflict
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
you're talking about represents As I
 
04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
understood it the board or yeah The
 
04:42:30.590 --> 04:42:30.600 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board now right is board yet no
 
04:42:33.070 --> 04:42:33.080 align:start position:0%
the council yes Council okay thank you
 
04:42:36.670 --> 04:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
the council is a establishing or or
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
advising the um helping with the
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
establishment of the rules and the
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
parameters and so therefore it doesn't
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
conflict over here because the office is
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
simply going by the rules set with the
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
guidance of the council I would agree
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
with that if it didn't say that the U
 
04:42:58.350 --> 04:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
technical skills are prescribed by the
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
office the um examination is approved by
 
04:43:05.390 --> 04:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
the office up here on 9 20 the
 
04:43:07.390 --> 04:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
requirements are prescribed by the
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
office so so would it be helpful oh
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you would it be helpful
 
04:43:17.510 --> 04:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
then if um if where it said uh
 
04:43:17.520 --> 04:43:19.350 align:start position:0%
then if um if where it said uh
requirements

04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
as formed in consultation with the
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
council were Blah Blah Blah by the
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
office I mean I think the intent here
 
04:43:28.150 --> 04:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
clearly is that it's a it's just a
 
04:43:29.948 --> 04:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
clerical task that you all are not
 
04:43:32.270 --> 04:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
leaving your jobs to go do what the
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
office staff can do they're following
 
04:43:37.190 --> 04:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
out what was pre agreed on as I
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
understand it so how how does the
 
04:43:42.750 --> 04:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
language get how would you like to see
 
04:43:42.760 --> 04:43:43.590 align:start position:0%
language get how would you like to see
or

04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:43:46.110 --> 04:43:46.120 align:start position:0%
request that that language I mean I
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
understand um if we're going to The
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board which I am opposed to but
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
if they are going to um at least if it's
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
being prescribed by the board by the
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
office that they would um right be in
 
04:44:05.310 --> 04:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
consultation with the um mid refe board
 
04:44:08.230 --> 04:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
at this point in Ru making we are making
 
04:44:08.240 --> 04:44:09.150 align:start position:0%
at this point in Ru making we are making
the

04:44:09.150 --> 04:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:11.868 --> 04:44:11.878 align:start position:0%
qualifications so I feel like we're
 
04:44:15.510 --> 04:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
making those qualifications and then um
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
this gives them the power
 
04:44:20.190 --> 04:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
to it just it just seems like a conflict
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
to me they're they're making we're
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
making the rules and they're um
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
prescribing what we can and can't do one
 
04:44:30.270 --> 04:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
last question um yeah just just a
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
reminder we're going to be hashing this
 
04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
out in subcommittee so I don't want to
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
get too deep into it here okay
 
04:44:36.830 --> 04:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
and my apologies you need to understand
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not uh prescribing what future
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
actions are going to happen we're
 
04:44:45.310 --> 04:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
handling a whole lot of things and so I
 
04:44:47.310 --> 04:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to insinuate anything about
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
the Midwife report about changes coming
 
04:44:52.110 --> 04:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
up no no problem and I'm really happy
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
that this is going to sub commmittee and
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
we can deal with these little details in
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
more um a different
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
place any other question uh yes
 
04:45:02.910 --> 04:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative mench py thank you Mr
 
04:45:04.390 --> 04:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
question um currently the council sets
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
the parameters for education training um
 
04:45:17.830 --> 04:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
recertification continuing at all of
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
those things and where do you see
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
that process being disrupted in this
 
04:45:30.868 --> 04:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
amendment um by them changing the
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
prescribed um the requirements the
 
04:45:34.830 --> 04:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
Practical experience experiences
 
04:45:36.750 --> 04:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
requirement prescribed by the office
 
04:45:38.708 --> 04:45:38.718 align:start position:0%
versus the
 
04:45:41.070 --> 04:45:41.080 align:start position:0%
Council on those
 
04:45:44.948 --> 04:45:44.958 align:start position:0%
lines so in that currently it's done by
 
04:45:49.590 --> 04:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
the council and in this it indicates the
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
office right it would be one thing if
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
the if we make the prescriptions for
 
04:45:56.670 --> 04:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
what our training is and the office of
 
04:45:58.350 --> 04:45:58.360 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing is just right
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
following that when they're doing the
 
04:46:04.590 --> 04:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
um recertification or the certification
 
04:46:06.550 --> 04:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
they're just following what we do this
 
04:46:08.670 --> 04:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
kind of gives them the power to make
 
04:46:12.310 --> 04:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
those those particular um requirements
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that's what I have a concern
 
04:46:17.350 --> 04:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
with representative
 
04:46:20.830 --> 04:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you Mr chair could
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
you go back and explain to me what you
 
04:46:26.110 --> 04:46:26.120 align:start position:0%
said about this makes you vulnerable
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
because I I I was writing and didn't
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
catch everything and I want to make sure
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
I understood what you meant by that sure
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
um if the if this does give the office
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
of Professional Licensing the power to
 
04:46:38.430 --> 04:46:38.440 align:start position:0%
prescribe how many uh practical
 
04:46:40.430 --> 04:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
experiences we need by how many prenatal
 
04:46:42.150 --> 04:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
visits we need before we get certified
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
and how many you know they could make
 
04:46:45.390 --> 04:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
that astronomical number they could make
 
04:46:47.788 --> 04:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
it a lesser number that we think is is
 
04:46:50.990 --> 04:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
qualified and I just you know and and
 
04:46:52.548 --> 04:46:52.558 align:start position:0%
there's different things like technical
 
04:46:54.910 --> 04:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
skills they could prescribe to us that
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
we need to have technical skills that
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
are outside our you know ability to
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
obtain follow up um so it makes
 
04:47:08.990 --> 04:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
individual midwives potentially
 
04:47:10.548 --> 04:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
vulnerable is that what you mean the
 
04:47:12.230 --> 04:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
profession as a whole I mean you you
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
want to have the um all these
 
04:47:17.470 --> 04:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
qualifications want to go in line with
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
what our rules are and our scope of
 
04:47:19.040 --> 04:47:21.390 align:start position:0%
what our rules are and our scope of
practice

04:47:21.390 --> 04:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:47:24.708 --> 04:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
is goie thank you Mr
 
04:47:27.708 --> 04:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
chair uh going to page
 
04:47:32.670 --> 04:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
28 pass a a written examination now it's
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:48.990 --> 04:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
council but when I look at page
 
04:47:51.788 --> 04:47:51.798 align:start position:0%
34 the scope of practice and procedures
 
04:47:53.310 --> 04:47:53.320 align:start position:0%
for the practice of mid wee including
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
policies and professional Direction and
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
supervision and the El and below that
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for the
 
04:48:00.990 --> 04:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
certification fall in the role of the
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
council is that not contradicting given
 
04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:06.788 align:start position:0%
council is that not contradicting given
the

04:48:06.788 --> 04:48:06.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's the ability to pick the exam
 
04:48:11.670 --> 04:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
versus the council well that is
 
04:48:13.548 --> 04:48:13.558 align:start position:0%
something I would would disagree with
 
04:48:16.350 --> 04:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
that they they would be able to pick the
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
exam so there's um on line 26 there's a
 
04:48:20.320 --> 04:48:21.868 align:start position:0%
exam so there's um on line 26 there's a
certification

04:48:21.868 --> 04:48:21.878 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:48:24.990 --> 04:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
examination which is
 
04:48:27.628 --> 04:48:27.638 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to get into details with
 
04:48:29.190 --> 04:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
you but it's the narm exam it's the
 
04:48:31.390 --> 04:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
North American registry of midwives
 
04:48:34.030 --> 04:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
which is what makes us be able to then
 
04:48:36.230 --> 04:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
become cpms which which certifi
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
professional midwives which the
 
04:48:40.350 --> 04:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
requirement of becoming an New Hampshire
 
04:48:43.190 --> 04:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
certified midwife so that exam which is
 
04:48:45.390 --> 04:48:45.400 align:start position:0%
not clarified in this because it's
 
04:48:47.230 --> 04:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
clarified in our rules like this is the
 
04:48:50.670 --> 04:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
law keeps it open and because NM if
 
04:48:51.868 --> 04:48:51.878 align:start position:0%
something happened in arm the New
 
04:48:53.070 --> 04:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would have to come up with
 
04:48:55.830 --> 04:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
that with that examination themselves
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
and the um one that you're talking about
 
04:49:01.510 --> 04:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
the written exam the oplc is making that
 
04:49:03.548 --> 04:49:03.558 align:start position:0%
um they're taking that as far as I
 
04:49:05.070 --> 04:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
understand from our meetings they're
 
04:49:07.548 --> 04:49:07.558 align:start position:0%
going to take that and put it online
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's all based on the rules and the
 
04:49:11.548 --> 04:49:11.558 align:start position:0%
the state law the state law and the
 
04:49:13.868 --> 04:49:13.878 align:start position:0%
state rules so that a midwife coming in
 
04:49:15.948 --> 04:49:15.958 align:start position:0%
they have to pass that exam at at this
 
04:49:17.670 --> 04:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
point there's like 20 questions that
 
04:49:20.110 --> 04:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
they go to the oplc and pass before they
 
04:49:21.628 --> 04:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
get certified and they're going to put
 
04:49:23.910 --> 04:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
that online and make make it more open
 
04:49:25.390 --> 04:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
book so that the
 
04:49:28.590 --> 04:49:28.600 align:start position:0%
um the uh applicants would then need to
 
04:49:30.030 --> 04:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
know where the rules are and go through
 
04:49:32.510 --> 04:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
and get that so that's that exam the one
 
04:49:34.708 --> 04:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
before that is our national exam that
 
04:49:36.708 --> 04:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
allows us to be certified in New
 
04:49:40.430 --> 04:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire follow but my question is it's
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
changed from the exam approved by the
 
04:49:45.070 --> 04:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
council which I feel is appropriate to
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
an exam approved by now oplc don't you
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
think the council should have the
 
04:49:53.948 --> 04:49:53.958 align:start position:0%
ability to choose the exam absolutely
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
that is my disagreement with this yeah
 
04:49:56.360 --> 04:49:57.510 align:start position:0%
that is my disagreement with this yeah
thank

04:49:57.510 --> 04:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:50:00.470 --> 04:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
you for clarification purposes on that I
 
04:50:01.910 --> 04:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
believe it actually says that the
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
examination has been administered
 
04:50:07.270 --> 04:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
by the council not just chosen by it in
 
04:50:07.280 --> 04:50:11.590 align:start position:0%
by the council not just chosen by it in
the

04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:13.990 --> 04:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
past yeah well they're striking it out
 
04:50:15.788 --> 04:50:15.798 align:start position:0%
now it wasn't stricken out before right
 
04:50:17.788 --> 04:50:17.798 align:start position:0%
we I don't have any problem with oplc
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
administering the exam that's fine with
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
me I don't even have honestly a problem
 
04:50:25.510 --> 04:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
with them doing the one um that is
 
04:50:27.310 --> 04:50:27.320 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the laws and the rules
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
because that's very
 
04:50:31.590 --> 04:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
concrete okay it's the one above that
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
that allows us to practice and that's a
 
04:50:37.470 --> 04:50:37.480 align:start position:0%
much different exam yep uh any other
 
04:50:39.390 --> 04:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you so much
 
04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
for your testimony appreciate it uh did
 
04:50:44.310 --> 04:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else wish to speak on Amendment
 
04:50:53.670 --> 04:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:00.948 --> 04:51:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
Courtney good afternoon Mr chair members
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee lindsy Courtney
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
oplc um I wish to thank representative
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
Gera for bringing this amendment forward
 
04:51:13.350 --> 04:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
um and for all of you and taking the
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
time to to review the bill I know that
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
it's a a lengthy bill
 
04:51:21.430 --> 04:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
um essentially what we have in the
 
04:51:25.270 --> 04:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
office is we have a series of changes
 
04:51:27.110 --> 04:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
statutorily transferring certain
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
Authority uh from the boards to the
 
04:51:33.110 --> 04:51:33.120 align:start position:0%
office over the last several years and
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately throughout that process we
 
04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
have not statutorily removed that
 
04:51:41.190 --> 04:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
conflicting Authority from the boards
 
04:51:43.708 --> 04:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
and it has created a a huge challenge
 
04:51:46.350 --> 04:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
operationally for the office and for the
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
boards particularly as it relates to rul
 
04:51:50.670 --> 04:51:50.680 align:start position:0%
making this has been going on for years
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
and I think it's been compounded by the
 
04:51:55.350 --> 04:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
changes from last session so I you know
 
04:51:56.910 --> 04:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sensitive to the fact that this is a
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
large bill but um we really do need some
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
changes in our statutes um we are
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
starting to see rules are still being
 
04:52:07.310 --> 04:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
moved forward by the boards for which
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have and they don't have
 
04:52:10.750 --> 04:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority but because of the
 
04:52:12.510 --> 04:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts in the law they're moving
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
those rules forward oplc is taking op
 
04:52:17.390 --> 04:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know taking objection to those rules
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's creating a mess operationally so we
 
04:52:22.110 --> 04:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
have to make some changes there are some
 
04:52:24.670 --> 04:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
things in this bill that I think we need
 
04:52:27.310 --> 04:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
to work on um Midwifery certainly Miss
 
04:52:29.628 --> 04:52:29.638 align:start position:0%
Stevens pointed some out at the time
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
this was drafted a lot of the language
 
04:52:33.390 --> 04:52:33.400 align:start position:0%
was drafted I believe hb2 was still in
 
04:52:35.670 --> 04:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
the works and so there were some changes
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
contemplated um that correspond with the
 
04:52:39.150 --> 04:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
changes here because this was
 
04:52:41.070 --> 04:52:41.080 align:start position:0%
essentially the back half of hb2 that
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
you saw last year so I think there are
 
04:52:45.430 --> 04:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
certainly some things that we need to
 
04:52:47.708 --> 04:52:47.718 align:start position:0%
address in subcommittee but as a whole
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
as a matter of policy we do need to
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
remove the conflicts and the conflicts
 
04:52:53.548 --> 04:52:53.558 align:start position:0%
are really twofold conflicts respect to
 
04:52:53.558 --> 04:52:54.548 align:start position:0%
are really twofold conflicts respect to
who

04:52:54.548 --> 04:52:54.558 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:52:57.708 --> 04:52:57.718 align:start position:0%
licenses the uh individuals in
 
04:52:59.230 --> 04:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
accordance with criteria established by
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
the boards now you made clear last
 
04:53:02.948 --> 04:53:02.958 align:start position:0%
session that it should be the office but
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
all of the boards have retained that
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
Authority in their statutes and most of
 
04:53:09.230 --> 04:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
the boards have gone along with the
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
transition but there are a handful that
 
04:53:13.868 --> 04:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
are insisting on reviewing um
 
04:53:15.990 --> 04:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
applications and I think we need some
 
04:53:18.390 --> 04:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
clarity from the legislature as to who
 
04:53:20.590 --> 04:53:20.600 align:start position:0%
is who should be doing that and that's
 
04:53:22.948 --> 04:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
what this is intended to address same
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
thing regarding approval of education
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
programs in accordance with the criteria
 
04:53:29.948 --> 04:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
established by the boards um there's a
 
04:53:31.628 --> 04:53:31.638 align:start position:0%
little bit of disciplinary language in
 
04:53:33.150 --> 04:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
here I think we addressed most of that
 
04:53:34.708 --> 04:53:34.718 align:start position:0%
last session but there is a little bit
 
04:53:37.270 --> 04:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
of that um and then who does the
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
renewals so it's definitely large and
 
04:53:42.350 --> 04:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's large is because the
 
04:53:44.708 --> 04:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
office's regulatory framework is
 
04:53:47.070 --> 04:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
extremely vast it's very much like
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services we have a lot
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
of statutes and unfortunately they were
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
not all drafted at the same time to be
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
consistent with each other and it we're
 
04:53:56.910 --> 04:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
running into problems operationally and
 
04:53:59.030 --> 04:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
so I would ask for your support happy to
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
work with members of the subcommittee to
 
04:54:02.830 --> 04:54:02.840 align:start position:0%
get it right um go through it with a
 
04:54:04.910 --> 04:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
fine tooth com but we really do need to
 
04:54:07.070 --> 04:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
make some changes thank you for your
 
04:54:08.350 --> 04:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
time I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:54:10.708 --> 04:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
directory yes repres
 
04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:18.070 --> 04:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.590 --> 04:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
question my big concern is and you heard
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
it is 112 Pages here in front of us that
 
04:54:26.470 --> 04:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
goes well beyond just taking away the
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
authority of the boards giving it to you
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
instead on what's going on my question
 
04:54:34.830 --> 04:54:34.840 align:start position:0%
is why wasn't that part brought forward
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
as one bill and then the rest of it
 
04:54:37.760 --> 04:54:38.628 align:start position:0%
as one bill and then the rest of it
brought

04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
brought
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
in as something else
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
it's bothers me to be here today with
 
04:54:48.548 --> 04:54:48.558 align:start position:0%
112 page Amendment with the concerns you
 
04:54:50.030 --> 04:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
had from folks out there that are
 
04:54:50.040 --> 04:54:52.150 align:start position:0%
had from folks out there that are
legitimate

04:54:52.150 --> 04:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
04:54:54.470 --> 04:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
concerns whereas if you were truly
 
04:54:56.830 --> 04:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to make those changes of taking
 
04:54:59.548 --> 04:54:59.558 align:start position:0%
opcs charge over the boards could have
 
04:55:01.510 --> 04:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
easily been done with all everything
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
without everything else that's in here
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
certainly uh thank you representative
 
04:55:08.470 --> 04:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
goalie and to be clear this is this bill
 
04:55:10.830 --> 04:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
came out of the hp2 session last year
 
04:55:12.708 --> 04:55:12.718 align:start position:0%
this was not the mechanism that I would
 
04:55:15.788 --> 04:55:15.798 align:start position:0%
have liked to have you review this bill
 
04:55:17.670 --> 04:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
um and I know that the sponsors made
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
several attempts to um find a different
 
04:55:24.830 --> 04:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
mechanism um essentially hb2 included
 
04:55:26.910 --> 04:55:26.920 align:start position:0%
this language last year or the bulk of
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
the language and it was decided at that
 
04:55:31.150 --> 04:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
point in time because there was not
 
04:55:33.390 --> 04:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
enough time to review it that you would
 
04:55:36.310 --> 04:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
essentially divorce that um the back
 
04:55:38.110 --> 04:55:38.120 align:start position:0%
half from hb2 moved forward with the
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
front half the front half that's now
 
04:55:41.910 --> 04:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
creating conflicts in the law is the
 
04:55:43.830 --> 04:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
problem and so there was a commitment
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
from this committee I believe to review
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
that and to move forward with it um on a
 
04:55:53.670 --> 04:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
retained bill which was 518 and so then
 
04:55:56.670 --> 04:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
again uh I know representative grota uh
 
04:55:59.868 --> 04:55:59.878 align:start position:0%
tried in October um after about a month
 
04:56:02.110 --> 04:56:02.120 align:start position:0%
director alak cona said can't do it
 
04:56:03.548 --> 04:56:03.558 align:start position:0%
can't move forward and I believe the
 
04:56:05.830 --> 04:56:05.840 align:start position:0%
filing deadlines had passed so I reached
 
04:56:07.430 --> 04:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
out to Senator Rosenwald and I said this
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
is going to be a problem for us she
 
04:56:13.230 --> 04:56:13.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to file an LSR um or to amend her
 
04:56:16.868 --> 04:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
an existing LSR and to put it on that um
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
and then at some point Senator Rosenwald
 
04:56:20.230 --> 04:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
said that the speaker had a different
 
04:56:24.070 --> 04:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism for solving the problem and uh
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
I think that mechanism was an amendment
 
04:56:29.390 --> 04:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
to this bill so I don't think anybody
 
04:56:32.390 --> 04:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
intended this amendment to play out the
 
04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
way it did
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
my preference would have had to have
 
04:56:38.708 --> 04:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
this legislative body pass it as a
 
04:56:42.470 --> 04:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
package either with hb2 655 409 same
 
04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill was heard multiple times last
 
04:56:47.590 --> 04:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
session um but unfortunately that's
 
04:56:52.070 --> 04:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
where we're at um and and and again I'm
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
sorry for any part that I played in that
 
04:56:58.628 --> 04:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
but uh but but that's how it ended up
 
04:56:58.638 --> 04:57:02.190 align:start position:0%
but uh but but that's how it ended up
here

04:57:02.190 --> 04:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:02.200 --> 04:57:03.868 align:start position:0%
 
follow

04:57:03.868 --> 04:57:03.878 align:start position:0%
follow
 
04:57:03.878 --> 04:57:05.150 align:start position:0%
follow
I

04:57:05.150 --> 04:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
get be careful how say be um you look at
 
04:57:10.708 --> 04:57:10.718 align:start position:0%
it and you say well I wish it would have
 
04:57:12.708 --> 04:57:12.718 align:start position:0%
gone through in House Bill 2 and hearing
 
04:57:14.430 --> 04:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns and the complaints on the
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
language here today if this had gone
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
through in House Bill 2 where would we
 
04:57:17.520 --> 04:57:18.350 align:start position:0%
through in House Bill 2 where would we
be

04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:57:21.190 --> 04:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
today well on Midwifery specifically
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 contemplated moving them to
 
04:57:24.948 --> 04:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
advisory which is why you have this
 
04:57:28.150 --> 04:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
language and so by divorcing it and not
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
and not making those changes in
 
04:57:33.270 --> 04:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
hb2 um I think that is that is part part
 
04:57:35.628 --> 04:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
of the challenge I I disagree with
 
04:57:37.470 --> 04:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
respect to the electrical comments if
 
04:57:39.270 --> 04:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
you look at actually what's proposed to
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
be repealed it's language that says that
 
04:57:45.670 --> 04:57:45.680 align:start position:0%
the board shall um review information or
 
04:57:47.350 --> 04:57:47.360 align:start position:0%
information shall be provided to the
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
board that's not the process that's
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
contemplated by the statutory changes so
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
I I think if if we were to spend time
 
04:57:58.590 --> 04:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
which I know is what you would like
 
04:58:01.070 --> 04:58:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking through some of the stakeholders
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
that the issues that they've identified
 
04:58:05.430 --> 04:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
don't think are actual issues with
 
04:58:08.708 --> 04:58:08.718 align:start position:0%
respect to manufactured housing um I I
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
don't read this bill as proposing to
 
04:58:12.788 --> 04:58:12.798 align:start position:0%
bring back the complaint board what I re
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
read this bill to do is to include the
 
04:58:17.310 --> 04:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that was within the
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
complaint board under the installers
 
04:58:21.510 --> 04:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
board because if you remember in House
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that eliminated the complaint
 
04:58:27.150 --> 04:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
board so I think part of the problem was
 
04:58:29.948 --> 04:58:29.958 align:start position:0%
created by the fact that the what
 
04:58:31.670 --> 04:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
happened last session which is to take
 
04:58:34.310 --> 04:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
the back half of off of to and decide to
 
04:58:38.430 --> 04:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:40.310 --> 04:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
separately uh sure representative
 
04:58:41.948 --> 04:58:41.958 align:start position:0%
greater than repres okay so I just want
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
to address the first of all I want the
 
04:58:46.390 --> 04:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
committee to realize this is what
 
04:58:49.868 --> 04:58:49.878 align:start position:0%
happens when we make big changes okay
 
04:58:52.270 --> 04:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
because all the stuff is intertwined and
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
at the end somebody has to since we we
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
own it because we made all these changes
 
04:59:01.310 --> 04:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
number two um you might recall that the
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of this of this particular
 
04:59:06.430 --> 04:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
year we had a lot of oplc bills which
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
were similar to House Bill 2 so what
 
04:59:12.948 --> 04:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
this and this is why we have to go
 
04:59:14.670 --> 04:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
through this I'm sorry now that I think
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
about it with you um is because if you
 
04:59:20.110 --> 04:59:20.120 align:start position:0%
don't you know for example and some of
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
the um bills that you have which make
 
04:59:26.868 --> 04:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
which reinstates an Advisory board for
 
04:59:30.430 --> 04:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
the Manufacturing Housing group and puts
 
04:59:33.030 --> 04:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
the midwif as a an Advisory Board all
 
04:59:35.070 --> 04:59:35.080 align:start position:0%
all these things if you if those things
 
04:59:37.910 --> 04:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
somehow don't come out exactly the same
 
04:59:40.310 --> 04:59:40.320 align:start position:0%
as what as the legis this is going to
 
04:59:43.110 --> 04:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
get affected so that's
 
04:59:47.230 --> 04:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
why um when we first and what represent
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
what direct Courtney said I keep
 
04:59:52.030 --> 04:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
promoting her to representative um what
 
04:59:53.830 --> 04:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
directing Courtney says is true I mean
 
04:59:55.868 --> 04:59:55.878 align:start position:0%
this has been I didn't I'm the believe
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
me I'm the last person that wants to
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
bring a huge book to a committee but
 
05:00:02.628 --> 05:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
this has been we've been we've tried
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
this we've been trying to work on this
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
since the last August this is how long
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
we've been sitting on this so um I
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
apologize but at the same time at this
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
point we just have to deal with it and
 
05:00:18.150 --> 05:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to take it on I'm willing to
 
05:00:20.708 --> 05:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
take it on sorry I just want to
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
everybody realize why we are where we
 
05:00:26.430 --> 05:00:26.440 align:start position:0%
are thank you representative leas and I
 
05:00:27.548 --> 05:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
was actually going to make some of the
 
05:00:29.070 --> 05:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
comments that representative grota just
 
05:00:31.350 --> 05:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
did um the subcommittee is working
 
05:00:33.190 --> 05:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
through House Bill 1271 we're actually
 
05:00:35.590 --> 05:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
meeting again tomorrow morning and we
 
05:00:37.230 --> 05:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten to some of the parts like
 
05:00:39.868 --> 05:00:39.878 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing uh Midwifery and
 
05:00:42.788 --> 05:00:42.798 align:start position:0%
some others but um you know well I
 
05:00:44.548 --> 05:00:44.558 align:start position:0%
didn't want to take on 122 page Bill
 
05:00:47.030 --> 05:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to stay in touch and
 
05:00:50.670 --> 05:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
so you know maybe if we do p we decide
 
05:00:52.270 --> 05:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
to go forward with some of these maybe
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
they'll come out of this thing or
 
05:00:57.628 --> 05:00:57.638 align:start position:0%
whatever we'll talk about it um but yeah
 
05:01:00.548 --> 05:01:00.558 align:start position:0%
it's complicated thank
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
you any other question yes represent
 
05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:08.120 align:start position:0%

know having this com
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Encyclopedia of what needs
 
05:01:17.830 --> 05:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
to be done uh is helpful because the all
 
05:01:19.990 --> 05:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
the bills that we have in our
 
05:01:22.030 --> 05:01:22.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee you know we are changing
 
05:01:24.390 --> 05:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
from office to executive director
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
executive director office the
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
consistency to know where the
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
consistencies what the changes are going
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
to be this is helpful to have
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
this and uh I appreciate that it's a lot
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
of work but we have to do it thank you
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder uh to the committee
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're not in an executive session
 
05:01:46.708 --> 05:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
we're asking questions of the of the
 
05:01:49.788 --> 05:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
people up front so we'll try to keep it
 
05:01:51.548 --> 05:01:51.558 align:start position:0%
to that yes representative
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
schm thank you Mr
 
05:01:59.788 --> 05:01:59.798 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so uh this is the kind of um
 
05:02:03.990 --> 05:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
small detail stuff that that happens in
 
05:02:04.000 --> 05:02:05.230 align:start position:0%
small detail stuff that that happens in
large

05:02:05.230 --> 05:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
large
 
05:02:09.030 --> 05:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
bills I I've been here now for 22 years
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
I have seen on occasion when the process
 
05:02:16.590 --> 05:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
you know Skips a page you you name it
 
05:02:19.830 --> 05:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
little details that get
 
05:02:23.548 --> 05:02:23.558 align:start position:0%
overlooked uh get uh left out whatever
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
it is but it's something that is
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
imperfect and needs to be
 
05:02:28.480 --> 05:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
imperfect and needs to be
fixed

05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
05:02:34.150 --> 05:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
and it happens and the alternative is we
 
05:02:36.548 --> 05:02:36.558 align:start position:0%
basically say oh well leave it the way
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
it is and that's kind of like saying
 
05:02:40.990 --> 05:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
that the Christmas tree lights don't
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
come on because we didn't connect these
 
05:02:46.310 --> 05:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
two wires but just leave it that way and
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
if it flickers what the hell uh
 
05:02:51.190 --> 05:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
something like this happened I think
 
05:02:52.150 --> 05:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
with the
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
Challenger uh when something got
 
05:02:56.270 --> 05:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
overlooked is there a question yeah
 
05:02:58.948 --> 05:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
there is a question I'm dealing with the
 
05:03:01.310 --> 05:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
the I'm not asking a question I'm making
 
05:03:04.708 --> 05:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
a statement that we are we are we are
 
05:03:07.670 --> 05:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the situation which is on
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
us to fix I I I agree and it's going
 
05:03:11.948 --> 05:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
it's going to sub commmittee we can
 
05:03:13.470 --> 05:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
discuss but right
 
05:03:17.510 --> 05:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
now you've I'm not the point is that
 
05:03:20.548 --> 05:03:20.558 align:start position:0%
we've gotten into the discussion so now
 
05:03:21.990 --> 05:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have to get back out of the
 
05:03:24.070 --> 05:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
discussion but a few things have to be
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
clarified and it this is a
 
05:03:28.948 --> 05:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
representative gr said this is on us to
 
05:03:31.270 --> 05:03:31.280 align:start position:0%
fix and it's going to get fixed in the
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and so some of these little
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh little
 
05:03:38.590 --> 05:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
matters um are causing some confusion it
 
05:03:40.548 --> 05:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
will be worked out in the subcommittee
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
but it is appropriate and as the old
 
05:03:47.750 --> 05:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
saying goes we ain't making sausage here
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
and now we're making
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
sausage thank you any further
 
05:03:56.270 --> 05:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very seeing none I I
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
do have one uh really quick it is an
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
actual question um and it maybe goes a
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
little bit outside the scope of just the
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
bill itself so uh it might be helpful
 
05:04:06.430 --> 05:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
heading into subcommittee uh I'm sensing
 
05:04:09.910 --> 05:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
anyway a lot of confusion um in the
 
05:04:12.628 --> 05:04:12.638 align:start position:0%
distinction between the office setting
 
05:04:14.868 --> 05:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
criteria and the office working in
 
05:04:16.868 --> 05:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the board and using the
 
05:04:20.510 --> 05:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
board's um you know to to make that
 
05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
criteria if you could when you come to
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee although I don't want
 
05:04:25.470 --> 05:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
to step on the chair of the
 
05:04:27.628 --> 05:04:27.638 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's toes at all um just
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
clarify for us the relationship and how
 
05:04:32.548 --> 05:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
that works and where to find it in stat
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
stat so that we can refer back to it so
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
that there isn't this constant confusion
 
05:04:38.510 --> 05:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
in question about whether or not who's
 
05:04:39.948 --> 05:04:39.958 align:start position:0%
actually setting the criteria and who
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
has the power to set the criteria that
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful certainly I can do
 
05:04:46.830 --> 05:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
that um just for reference it's in RSA
 
05:04:50.110 --> 05:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
chapter 310 which basically says the uh
 
05:04:54.390 --> 05:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
the office has to um implement or
 
05:04:55.910 --> 05:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
license people in accordance with the
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
criteria established by the
 
05:05:01.070 --> 05:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
boards thank you thank you uh sorry
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative you know try and make
 
05:05:04.910 --> 05:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
this a question so uh would you think
 
05:05:07.430 --> 05:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be helpful for this
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh if I or someone sent
 
05:05:12.190 --> 05:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
them a link to the beginning of what we
 
05:05:14.990 --> 05:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
did with House Bill 1271 and on that one
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
since it did a lot of moving to advisory
 
05:05:19.270 --> 05:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
um we about spent about an hour hashing
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
out what's the difference between
 
05:05:24.548 --> 05:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
advisory and a statutory
 
05:05:26.670 --> 05:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes I think that would be
 
05:05:30.110 --> 05:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
helpful I'll try and do that thank you
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions thank you for your
 
05:05:33.948 --> 05:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
time thank you very much director
 
05:05:35.390 --> 05:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate it would anyone else like to
 
05:05:40.910 --> 05:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:43.628 --> 05:05:43.638 align:start position:0%
1095 seeing none I'll close the public
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
hearing um that will be referred to
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
subcommittee which I will leave to the
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
chair to straighten out and uh we are in
 
05:06:01.390 --> 05:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.400 --> 05:06:26.910 align:start position:0%
 
time

05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:31.390 --> 05:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
it too mucho complicated we didn't have
 
05:06:31.400 --> 05:06:34.868 align:start position:0%
it too mucho complicated we didn't have
time

05:06:34.868 --> 05:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
