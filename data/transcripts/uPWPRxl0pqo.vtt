i was very surprised to see that what
 
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
was required was almost
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
300 appointments to about to over 200
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
statutory committees
 
00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
it's a staggering task for any incoming
 
00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.230 align:start position:0%
it's a staggering task for any incoming
speaker

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
and after uh some discussion working
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
with house committee services we decided
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
to make a comprehensive
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
list of these committees we looked at
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
their um
 
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
to assemble the frequency of meetings
 
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
and their responsibilities and that sort
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
of thing it took
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
pam months and months of work to
 
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
pam months and months of work to
assemble

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
assemble
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
a very complete chart of all of these
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
i introduced a bill to form a committee
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
on committees
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
and the governor in the meantime great
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
minds think alike he introduced
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
he added into the budget
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
hb 4 at the time committee on committees
 
00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
was established
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
to look at all the existing statutory
 
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.469 align:start position:0%
to look at all the existing statutory
committees

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:28.479 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
and also all committees that were
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
created by executive order
 
00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 align:start position:0%
um because the budget wasn't signed into
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
law until october 2019
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
and we had to report by february 1st we
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
had a very compressed time schedule
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
but we did an awful lot and most of it
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
was because pam had done as much work as
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
she had
 
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
my original bill hb 1245
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
put into place the recommendations of
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
that original committee of committees
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
and created a new one so we could finish
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
our work
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was signed into law we met
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
for uh several months completed our work
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
and hb 186 is the
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh by is the result of the bipartisan
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
report of that committee on committees
 
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.749 align:start position:0%
report of that committee on committees
um

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
it too repeals and makes adjustments to
 
00:08:25.749 --> 00:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
several statutory committees on the
 
00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:26.710 align:start position:0%
several statutory committees on the
committee

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
i chaired both of them was
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
representative mary smith
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
i mean mary heath dave danielson
 
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
sharon carson and cindy rosenwald
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
our charge we felt was to simply
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
review um and make no substantive
 
00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
changes to the responsibilities of the
 
00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
changes to the responsibilities of the
um

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
of the committees um and we tried to
 
00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:53.430 align:start position:0%
of the committees um and we tried to
tweak

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
tweak
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
where necessary to make them more
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
relevant and if they hadn't been meeting
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
for a really long time
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know to to talk about repealing
 
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.190 align:start position:0%
uh you know to to talk about repealing
them

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
i want to uh i think it's important that
 
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.240 align:start position:0%
the committee understand
 
00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.560 align:start position:0%
uh the review every
 
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
administrative agency came in to discuss
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
the statutory committees and commissions
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that were associated with their agencies
 
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
and we discussed their history their
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
frequency of meeting
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and their need for continued
 
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
purpose and their need for continued
existence

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
existence
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee our committee
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
on committees
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
also conferred with commission and
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
committee chairs
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
to get their input and the
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations are
 
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
the culmination of a great deal of
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
discussion and review
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we strictly i mean we strictly
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
adhere to
 
00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
our charge of being administrative and
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
not substantive
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
in our in our review
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee may recall that
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
in 2010
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh former representative neil kirk and
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
lori harding pursued a similar course
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
it had been a decade since the statutory
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
commissions had been reviewed
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it was time to renew them again
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
because they do proliferate
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
rapidly the hb4 committee on committee
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
report made a number of recommendations
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
to try to tackle these changes
 
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
and to make the work of these committees
 
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:24.550 align:start position:0%
and to make the work of these committees
more

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
meaningful that's also attached to the
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
report of this committee
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
i just want to say among the most
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
important recommendations
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
we made was for hcs to constantly keep
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
updated the list of committees
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
and by and to include by rule the
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of this committee which
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
you may not like
 
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
to do a periodic review of the
 
00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
outstanding committees
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
a decade is just too long and it
 
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.190 align:start position:0%
a decade is just too long and it
shouldn't

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
require almost two years of work to do
 
00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.030 align:start position:0%
require almost two years of work to do
this

00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
every 10 years and it just would be a
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
lot better
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
if we could keep things updated in my
 
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
if we could keep things updated in my
testimony

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
i included the recommendations of the
 
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.509 align:start position:0%
i included the recommendations of the
report

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
i was going to include those in my
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
but i um it's right there
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has to do with just making
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
sure that the standing committees
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
are aware of the statutory committees
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
that work
 
00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
on topics that are relevant
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
to their committee and we want to make
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
the staff the standing committees get
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
the reports
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
that these statutory committees do
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
because many times they just go to the
 
00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and the senate
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
president and the clerk
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
and they never get to where they need to
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
go um
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i'll just i'll wrap it up there
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
as far as my testimony is concerned and
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions of the
 
00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions of the
committee

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
i just because i heard the comments in
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
the beginning of the
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the meeting i just wanted to say as
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
far as the
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
the youth advisory council the only
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
change we made
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
there was to instead of just having
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
membership be post-secondary students
 
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
we expanded that category to high school
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
and post-secondary because there was a
 
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
lot of difficulty
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
based on the um testimony we took
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
in getting secondary uh post-secondary
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
students so that was the only thing that
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
was done there
 
00:12:38.069 --> 00:12:38.079 align:start position:0%
and as far as fish and game my
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
recollection of the testimony and this
 
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.550 align:start position:0%
recollection of the testimony and this
is

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
going back a while was that there was
 
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
going back a while was that there was
some

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
um difficulty in in getting people just
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
from the seacoast if i remember right
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
a sense from the testimony that we got
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
that uh marine resources was more than
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
seacoast issue um
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
but other than that um i'm happy to take
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
your questions
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
i i again i just want to assure the
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
committee that this was done in a very
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
and i want to um take the opportunity to
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank pam smarling
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
because if it wasn't for her back up for
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
this uh we
 
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
we never could have um accomplished it
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'm happy to take your
 
00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:25.829 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'm happy to take your
questions

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um and i'll
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
second the notion that uh pam smarling
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
star among stars here for all of us um
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
you said you will take questions i will
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
look to the committee to raise their
 
00:13:42.389 --> 00:13:42.399 align:start position:0%
hand or
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
signal somehow if they have questions
 
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:45.910 align:start position:0%
signal somehow if they have questions
for

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none i will ask um
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
one one is would you be willing to stick
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
around for a minute while
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
we talk with um with
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
the other agencies that are asking um
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
questions of us it may be best if you're
 
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
questions of us it may be best if you're
available

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
are you available for a few minutes sure
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to stay
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
um okay i also could you also just run
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
through again for me
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
the um the process that you went through
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um was it
 
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
looking first for low-hanging fruit were
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
you looking for committees that hadn't
 
00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
you looking for committees that hadn't
met

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
met
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
for a certain period of time and and um
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
and that was an indicator or where did
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
you go from there
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
well basically what pam did over months
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
and months of work is she compiled this
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
huge chart um which is attached to the
 
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.910 align:start position:0%
huge chart um which is attached to the
report

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
and she identified the
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
the committee the statute
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
she tried to track through where they
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
were listed on a website
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
some of them i mean that's among the
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
recommendations of our committee you
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't even
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
find them then she tried to find the
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
history of of when they had met
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
last and if she couldn't find it on the
 
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
website she reached out to
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
and we could see from the chart that she
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
put together that there were a lot of
 
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
put together that there were a lot of
committees

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
that hadn't met in a really long time
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
so we went so we tried to be
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about how we would approach
 
00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about how we would approach
it

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
and so what pam did is she basically
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
figured out every statutory committee's
 
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:35.910 align:start position:0%
figured out every statutory committee's
uh

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
link up to an administrative agency
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
and we she reached out to the agency she
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
told them this is the list of committees
 
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
that we've identified that you're
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to and we
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
brought the administrative committee
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
in so while we were driven in part
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
to try to um get rid of the low-hanging
 
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
to try to um get rid of the low-hanging
fruit

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
fruit
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't think that was the best way of
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
approaching it just because we did we
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
weren't totally sure of
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
who was meeting when based on the
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
information we had
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
and we just started with the
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
administrative agencies
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
and they did a phenomenal job of
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
summarizing the work that they do with
 
00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:17.110 align:start position:0%
summarizing the work that they do with
the

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the different agencies so what
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
is the second committee on committees
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
the first one
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i think we reviewed over 200 um
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
organizations so it wasn't just whether
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
they meet or not like for instance i
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
think it was something like
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
county finance they had met in a really
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
really long time
 
00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
but um the agency came in and said no
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
they're really important when we need
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
them we need them
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
so that's the other thing to just leave
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
some of them in place in case you need
 
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:47.829 align:start position:0%
some of them in place in case you need
them

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
i just uh just to keep going like
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
there the bill isn't just a couple of
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
pages because whenever you repeal a
 
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.629 align:start position:0%
pages because whenever you repeal a
committee

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
you have to go through all the statutes
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
and see where the committee is
 
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.030 align:start position:0%
and see where the committee is
referenced

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
so you have to delete the the cross
 
00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:04.390 align:start position:0%
so you have to delete the the cross
references

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
references
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing that we tried
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
to do some of these committees they
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
could have 15 people on them and it just
 
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.549 align:start position:0%
could have 15 people on them and it just
wasn't

00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
necessary and in an effort to reduce the
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
legislative burden
 
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
in some cases we like if they called for
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
five house reps we
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
we made it three things like that
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um what we have in front of us
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill came before legit for for
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
the people that don't
 
00:17:31.669 --> 00:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
realize this this came before
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
legislative administration last year
 
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
i think it got bogged down in the in the
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
senate is that right
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
well what um actually what happened was
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
so um hb4
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
created a committee on committees and
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
then hb
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
1245 contained the recommendations of
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
the hb4 committee
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
and also created a second committee on
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee so we could finish our work
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
and so hb 1245 was the lead bill
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
on an omnibus that was put together and
 
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
on an omnibus that was put together and
so

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
uh and so the governor signed into law
 
00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
that on the bus and since that created a
 
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee on committees then i chaired
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
the next one
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
and so we did some more work finishing
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
up our work and that's what hb
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
186 is so so usual
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
is 186 the
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
updated version since the last time
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
legislative administration
 
00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
saw this or it's a different bill
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
basically what it does is it embodies
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
the second part of the
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
work that we had we had to do i mean
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
without getting
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know i won't talk about the bill
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
numbers basically we had a committee on
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
committees we had a report date
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh we couldn't finish all our work in
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
the first part of it
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
so we introduced another bill and we
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
finished up
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
and we finished up in the in the next
 
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.789 align:start position:0%
and we finished up in the in the next
round

00:19:02.789 --> 00:19:02.799 align:start position:0%
round
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
so what you see here is a new bill that
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
i just introduced based on the second
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
half of the committee on committee's
 
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.270 align:start position:0%
half of the committee on committee's
work

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
and so it's a whole different set of um
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
committees being repealed etc
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
see representative lay with his hand up
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
taking the question so
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
clarify for me representative evil i'm
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
i'm a little lost on this
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we did consider last year
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
i believe a bill introduced by you
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
to alleged men which
 
00:19:41.909 --> 00:19:41.919 align:start position:0%
streamlined you know eliminated certain
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
committees or abolished them
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
things like that okay what happened to
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
it was signed into law okay so that's so
 
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.390 align:start position:0%
it was signed into law okay so that's so
so

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
following we're done okay so follow up
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just want to be sure
 
00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:56.230 align:start position:0%
mr chair i just want to be sure
absolutely

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so so then this bill is simply
 
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
a continuation but it is not repetitive
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
this is all new
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
we have not seen this before okay thank
 
00:20:05.679 --> 00:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
we have not seen this before okay thank
you

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
yeah that i think that was my confusion
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
as well um
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's um the only
 
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
there was one other question i had in
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
there for you and now i've lost it
 
00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
um but i'm sure it'll come back
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much for your
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
testimony if you'll hang on for a moment
 
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:27.029 align:start position:0%
testimony if you'll hang on for a moment
we

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
we may have other questions for you as
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
we go
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
um representative green could you uh
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
and promote her i am not seeing her at
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
but should we move on to the next person
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
sure sure okay i got a text from her she
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
said she's hung up in the other meeting
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
and she won't be able to attend but
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
i kind of explained what was going on
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill as far as lyac is concerned
 
00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
in this bill as far as lyac is concerned
okay

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
she was signed up in support so i'm sure
 
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.270 align:start position:0%
she was signed up in support so i'm sure
whatever

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
she had to add you've already given us
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
yeah as i say uh her only concern on
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
on lyac was just that they were having a
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
hard time attracting
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
post-secondary students and since that
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
requirement was in there
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
she just asked if it was added to
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
um to high school because
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
she just didn't she thought it would be
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if a seat was not filled
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
um because it was required to be filled
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
by post-secondary
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
okay i thought of my other i thought of
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
my other question
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
um when when you spoke to um
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
agencies um did you go
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
into the into the details of of
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
um specifically in this fish and game
 
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
question we have
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
would you have gone would it be normal
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
practice for you
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
to have gone as deeply into where
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
membership should come from
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
would that be a normal practice i think
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
it's i don't recall
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
the precise conversation with them
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
i guess i have to go back to the process
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that we did and we tried really hard
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
not to make
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
changes that were really dramatically
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
um altering my recollection again
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
is that we i wouldn't have made that
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
change if we hadn't or we wouldn't the
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
whole committee wouldn't have
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
recommended that change if we hadn't
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
discussed it with fish and game
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
and felt like there was consensus there
 
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.950 align:start position:0%
and felt like there was consensus there
again

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
the only reason that might have been
 
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:45.990 align:start position:0%
the only reason that might have been
changed

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
is because there was some sense that
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
they were having trouble
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
filling it in with people i that one i
 
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't know and again i i just want to
 
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.149 align:start position:0%
don't know and again i i just want to
say

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
it was never the intent of this
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee to make
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
substantive changes um that
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
would alter things you know
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
substantively we had several people i
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
will say agencies come in
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
um and say you know this really needs to
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
be revamped this isn't working
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
and and we would say to them that's not
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
our charge
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
um you need to go back and introduce
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
um a new bill to accomplish the things
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
want to accomplish we were kind of a
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
cleanup crew
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
i mean that's the way i viewed it so if
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's perceived
 
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
by fish and game that we did something
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
substantive that they disagree with
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
i you know um i'm i'm not going to stand
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
here and say that they shouldn't do it i
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
would just say that our process
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
was such that that's what we thought the
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
consensus view was
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
did did the committee on committees make
 
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
any recommendation
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
as to how often this should be done if
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
it's not every 10 years
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
well the thing is that
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
these things proliferate like crazy
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
and my thought the committee's thought
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
was that
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
the ledge admin committee
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
at least every five years could create
 
00:24:19.269 --> 00:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc committee of some sort
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
and just start to review these things so
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
this was a
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
sort of a routine thing that the
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee did
 
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:28.320 align:start position:0%
10 years is really really too long and
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
you can see it was a two-year process
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for me
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
to to figure a way that it would be
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
uh quicker than the time that it took
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
i had hoped this time around that we
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
might be able to get a rule
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
to amend the responsibilities of the
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
legislative administration
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
committee to include a review
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
but um that wasn't approved by the rules
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
committee and i think in part because i
 
00:24:59.120 --> 00:24:59.590 align:start position:0%
committee and i think in part because i
didn't

00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
i wasn't there to sort of present it
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
um that it was the recommendation of
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and all the reasons why
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
we thought that was a good thing to do i
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
mean you guys can do it whether it's in
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
the rule or not but
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done more than every 10
 
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done more than every 10
years

00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
you know it's sort of like it just
 
00:25:21.669 --> 00:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
builds up and builds up and builds up
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then somebody goes ah this really
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be reviewed and then somebody
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
introduces a bill
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
um it shouldn't be that way it should be
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
a routine procedure and
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i know we're talking about
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
the specific bill but i really hope when
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
you guys have a little breathing room
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
you can look at the report
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
and the recommendations because there's
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
stuff there like how ols
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
should interact with the members um you
 
00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:45.430 align:start position:0%
should interact with the members um you
know

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
make sure they anyway well
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
we won't be we won't be executing it
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
today um
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
so it is something that the committee
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
has the ability
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
to take a look at um any idea
 
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
you weren't you went from the 300
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
appointees that had to be made to
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
various committees do you know what the
 
00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
various committees do you know what the
number

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
dropped to after um i didn't go back and
 
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.789 align:start position:0%
dropped to after um i didn't go back and
count

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
count
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know i i will say for all the effort
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
i i kind of wish we were able to cut out
 
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:16.310 align:start position:0%
i i kind of wish we were able to cut out
more

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
but you know people came in and said
 
00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:19.590 align:start position:0%
but you know people came in and said
some

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
they were useful i think in the end um i
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
don't know pam might know better than me
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we repealed about 40 but we
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
reduced the membership of a lot
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
let's say 50 to 60. okay
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
yep it's a number um thank you very much
 
00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:35.830 align:start position:0%
yep it's a number um thank you very much
again

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
um are we set now to bring in
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
um the insurance department
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
sorry about that okay here we go uh
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
mr brennan hi thank you so tyler brandon
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
with the insurance department
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
welcome you're you're
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
you're willing to uh up you're muted
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
thank you i um i thought i'd lost you
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
there for a moment
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
so um this is uh we are in support of
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's uh not something we requested but
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
this committee that it repeals the
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
insurance oversight committee the joint
 
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:29.830 align:start position:0%
insurance oversight committee the joint
healthcare

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
committee is a perfect example i think
 
00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
of the the kind of committee that was
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
considered obsolete this committee was
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
created 10 years ago
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
really when the aca federal law was
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
being rolled out
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
and at this point it's it's completed
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
its mandate
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
it really was involved in some of the
 
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
state-based decisions we would have to
 
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
state-based decisions we would have to
make

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
although most of those decisions were
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
are we actually going to do this at the
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
state level and not have the federal
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
government take it over for us
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
so there were pretty easy decisions um
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
the technical amendment that uh we did
 
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.190 align:start position:0%
the technical amendment that uh we did
suggest

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
support for really just uh is to make
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
other references within the same chapter
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
to the oversight committee
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
are also taken out but we do see those
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
changes as purely technical
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
um because this committee is obsolete it
 
00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean some of the discussions
 
00:28:17.919 --> 00:28:18.389 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean some of the discussions
that

00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be big policy uh decisions at the
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh the kind of decisions that wouldn't
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
need legislation and of course you know
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of important decisions will end up
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
in legislation is a commission that's
 
00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:29.990 align:start position:0%
in legislation is a commission that's
called

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
called
 
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
the commission on the status of health
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
coverage markets for individual and
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
small employers
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
and this is a great group because it
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
includes legislators it includes folks
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
from the carriers
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
and show insurance brokers employer
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
representatives and that's where a good
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
fruitful discussion can take place
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
of any policy decisions that the state
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
might move forward with
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
instead of this this other joint
 
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:53.190 align:start position:0%
instead of this this other joint
healthcare

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
committee that would be now removed
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
so um not much more to add to that uh so
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
we support the
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
the bill in this particular section uh
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
it is we are i am referring to
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
lines seven through nine on page one if
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
you have any questions but it's a
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
relatively small part of
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
the overall bill happy to take any
 
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
the overall bill happy to take any
questions

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony um are
 
00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.110 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony um are
there

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
as i understand it you just want to make
 
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.230 align:start position:0%
as i understand it you just want to make
sure

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
as a technical housekeeping item that
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
all references are removed when when
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
or commission is removed yeah so the
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill essentially moves
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
the main paragraph that uh that the
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
committee is described but there are a
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
couple of other parts of the chapter
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
that refer back to that
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
so and it's real nice because you can
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
just take it out of the portion of the
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
sentence without changing
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of the chapter so it's um they
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
should be easy fixes
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay um seeing no
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
questions um i will thank you for taking
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%

i've been listening to your proceedings
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
so far and i'd like to heartily agree
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
with representative ebel about the
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
process that they followed
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh it was in fact cooperative and
 
00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:46.149 align:start position:0%
uh it was in fact cooperative and
collaborative

00:30:46.149 --> 00:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
um and you'll note that we have actually
 
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
two agencies
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
two of our uh boards in this particular
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh section nine and section ten
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
and with section with respect to section
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
ten to the public water access advisory
 
00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:58.870 align:start position:0%
ten to the public water access advisory
board

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh their suggestions are good and we
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
certainly support those
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
number nine the only problem that we
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
have is the removal of the words
 
00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:10.559 align:start position:0%
all of whom shall be residents of the
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
seacoast region
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
and we successfully communicated to the
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee the need for this advisory
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
board but apparently didn't successfully
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
communicate just how closely tied
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
that particular advisory board is to the
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
industry in the state of new hampshire
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
which really is
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
centered on the seacoast i think the
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
concern that the advisory board
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
expressed when they got back to us was
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
they didn't want a situation
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
that could potentially happen where no
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
members of their advisory commission
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
were from seacoast towns or connected to
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
the commercial fishing industry
 
00:31:49.269 --> 00:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
so that's why we've raised this point
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
in this is a very active board in fact
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
they met as recently as last evening
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh they deal with issues that really
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
aren't dealt with elsewhere in the state
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
such as working with the national marine
 
00:32:02.399 --> 00:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
such as working with the national marine
fisheries

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh council working with the atlantic
 
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
state marine fisheries commission
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with the department of commerce
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
and noaa
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
on fishing and fishing enforcement these
 
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.029 align:start position:0%
on fishing and fishing enforcement these
are

00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
issues that really are located in this
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
particular industry and located and
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
centered in the seacoast region of the
 
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.029 align:start position:0%
centered in the seacoast region of the
state

00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
so we really would appreciate it if
 
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
there were no change to this particular
 
00:32:30.789 --> 00:32:30.799 align:start position:0%
commission and with that in mind to be
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
 
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.990 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions from the
committee

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um are there any i see one
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
hand representative lay
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
taking the the question so
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
um mr sanderson uh how do you define or
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of seacoast
 
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.950 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of seacoast
region

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
uh we actually have it in part of our
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
fish and game statutes
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's in rsa 206 2-8 and it it
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
deals with the appointment of a special
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner to the fish and game
 
00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.350 align:start position:0%
commissioner to the fish and game
commission

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
from the hounds and it involves 17 towns
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
that are in the city i could read them
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
for you no that's okay
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's okay as long as you have a
 
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
definition that's that's what i was
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
concerned follow-up mr chair
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
absolutely go ahead so the work of this
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh particular commission concerns uh
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
obviously the commercial marine
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
fisheries business
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
um is it possible that somebody could be
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
deeply engaged in that business
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh but live outside those 17 towns
 
00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh they may well live outside of those
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
towns but they certainly work in those
 
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.789 align:start position:0%
towns but they certainly work in those
towns

00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:38.559 align:start position:0%
that that's where the industry really is
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
centered we don't have any commercial
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
fishing processors in the marine area
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
that are outside of this particular
 
00:33:44.799 --> 00:33:45.509 align:start position:0%
that are outside of this particular
region

00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
my concern is that the the language
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
being deleted states
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
quite explicitly they must be residents
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
of that region
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
so if they live outside that region but
 
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
are engaged in business
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
in that region as you just stated they
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
would be barred from membership on this
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
commission correct
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
that is correct follow up
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
if the committee were to consider it an
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
improvement that they in being so
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
involved in the commercial fishing
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
industry regardless of where they reside
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
that would meet that concern
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
that so would you object to a change
 
00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
would uh i don't think that they would
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
because that certainly is what they're
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
really trying to get at here is having
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
people who are actively
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
fishing industry uh be the ones helping
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
and advising our marine division
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
so so there could be a possibility where
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
rather than defining it in terms of
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
place of residence it could be defined
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh engagement with
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
a particular uh business correct
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative roulard thank
 
00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:06.710 align:start position:0%
thank you representative roulard thank
you

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know representative lay and i are on
 
00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
the same page on this
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
um i i was concerned about uh somebody
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
that had a specific expertise and
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps had been involved
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
with this particular fish and game
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
group and perhaps moved outside
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
of that area and maybe somebody that
 
00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:29.990 align:start position:0%
of that area and maybe somebody that
would

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
be able to provide expertise because
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
maybe they were part
 
00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
of this particular board in the past
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the way that this is worded all of
 
00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:40.630 align:start position:0%
and the way that this is worded all of
whom

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
whom
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
shall be and my thought was perhaps the
 
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.310 align:start position:0%
shall be and my thought was perhaps the
majority

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
majority
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
of them be from that group but not
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
exclude people that you may
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
feel or that this group may feel would
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
be an absolute
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
asset so although i i understand that
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
residents could be changed
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
to folks engaged it also could be
 
00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:03.599 align:start position:0%
individuals that had previously been on
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
the board and the way that this
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
is it's limiting the whole enchilada
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
and i i think we probably um would not
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
want to have
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
all of whom but i wondered if that would
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
be a problem
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
at all mr sanderson i think that your
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
suggestions are good ones
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
and that what we're trying to do is
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
reflect the necessary expertise on the
 
00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.069 align:start position:0%
reflect the necessary expertise on the
board

00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%

sponsor of the bill
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%

00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
a question about the ability to
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
fill the committee that there was
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
um enough people to fill it is that
 
00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
a concern or no that really has not been
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
a concern

[Music]

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
the time being 9 39
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
um we've passed the time in the calendar
 
00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
um we've passed the time in the calendar
that

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
had listed the executive session um i'm
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
happy to
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
now open the executive session
 
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
and immediately recess the
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh executive session to a date certain
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
which we believe will be march 29th
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
um hoping for well we have the request
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
in for march 29th
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock um
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that you keep an eye on
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
um in the house
 
00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
because we really don't know
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
there seems to be in the list i saw a
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
committees all meeting that week so
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
where we meet what time we meet um but
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
as a committee um dealing with all of
 
00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
the remaining bills we have including
 
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
186 um on that
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
on that day um and beyond that
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
um i have no further business up i see a
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
hand by
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
representative lay or just a quick
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
question and it really just goes back to
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
hb 186 was the insurance department rep
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
actually suggest he was suggesting
 
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
another technical amendment to this
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
um yes representative lay he
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
had sent in okay
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
so i haven't seen yeah okay he had sent
 
00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:58.630 align:start position:0%
so i haven't seen yeah okay he had sent
in

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
i think uh representative roulard saw
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
that did you not
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to think of i don't know
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
if he just sent it to me
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
or whether he sent it to the entire
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
committee i know
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
um pam saw it um cam smarling but um
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
there was it they were just it was the
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
technical corrections of
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
where that um
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
was referenced throughout the statute so
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
that's that was all that was in there
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
but we could certainly i'll certainly
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
make sure the
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
entire committee gets it if they haven't
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
already been sent it
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um anything else from
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
anyone else that uh
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
we need to discuss
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
that's good things are smooth all right
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
so um the next thing uh you'll see i
 
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.069 align:start position:0%
so um the next thing uh you'll see i
guess

00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
is the calendar uh listing when our
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
and for some of the newer folks
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
because the deadline has been moved out
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
that gave us the ability to move this
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
this executive session out and hopefully
 
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
fit into
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's work schedules a little bit
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
better yeah
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
i see them um
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think uh that's it for
 
00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.510 align:start position:0%
and uh and i think uh that's it for
today

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
so enjoy the rest of your day and we'll
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
see you
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
probably the 29th great thank you
 
00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
probably the 29th great thank you
bye
