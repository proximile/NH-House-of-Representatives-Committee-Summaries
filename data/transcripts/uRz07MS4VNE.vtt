1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Members elect, in your seat pockets is an oath of office slip.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If somebody else, if there is not a slip in your seat pocket in front of you, please check underneath your seat because that is where your oath slip may likely be.

3
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If none is there, then somebody took it by accident.

4
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So please make sure that you read the oath slips.

5
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Do not sign said oath slips until I direct you to later.

6
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Gracias.

7
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Gracias.

9
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Спасибо.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Members, take your seats.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Thank you.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Members, please take your seats.

14
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
.

15
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.000
and F2L should be back there and the other side of the street should be over there.

16
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.500
But they're, the case for whatever time is there, the other side of the street.

17
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
That's where all they are.

18
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They're all the good.

19
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's why.

20
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That's why.

21
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That's why.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
That's why.

23
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's why.

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That's why.

25
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
That's why.

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That's why.

27
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Members will be in their seats.

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Members, please pay attention.

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In your seat pockets.

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, I want to explain the seat pockets.

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:58.500
If you were seated in the middle of a row or in Division I and V, the end of a row, your seat pockets may be under your seat.

32
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:10.000
So if the sheet in front of you in the box does not have your name on it, please check underneath your seat.

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Do not sign the oath of office until instructed to do so after you have taken the oath of office.

34
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If you have already done that, don't worry, I won't fire you.

35
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
If you do not have an oath slip, that means a neighbor took it.

36
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So please share.

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Make sure that you have the right one.

38
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They were all individually put in yesterday afternoon, and I was here at 7 o'clock last night putting these out, so I know that none of them moved.

39
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Thank you.

40
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Hear ye!

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Hear ye!

42
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Hear ye!

43
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:28.500
This day, December 7, 2022, the first Wednesday of December, being the day designated by the Constitution, Part 2, Article 3, for assembling of the body, the 168th General Court of the State of New Hampshire at the capital in the city of Concord, I do hereby convene to order the 2023 House of Representatives.

44
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:37.000
The members elect will rise and be reverently attentive while Reverend Peggy Schnack, the curate of St.

45
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.500
Paul's Episcopal Church and Concord, leads us in prayer.

46
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.500
I invite you to close your eyes, bow your heads in whatever prayer position you prefer.

47
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.500
Let us pray.

48
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.500
Creator God, source of all being.

49
00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:06.000
We know that we live in a world that is so often filled with division and mistrust in our communities and our government.

50
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We also know that it does not have to be that way.

51
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Help those gathered here today to serve with integrity, to have open minds and hearts so that they may faithfully serve those who have entrusted them with the responsibility to be their voices in our government.

52
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:41.500
Give them the grace not only to hear, but truly listen to one another and the people of the state of New Hampshire.

53
00:04:41.500 --> 00:05:00.500
Grant them the wisdom to work together and put aside individual ambition so that they may enact such laws as to bring unity around the causes of justice, peace, and respect for the dignity of every human being.

54
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:21.000
I ask your blessings to come upon all who are gathered here so that they may feel a presence beyond themselves that will sustain and guide them in times of conflict, uncertainty, and doubt, as well as in times of joy.

55
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Amen.

56
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Please remain standing while Representative-elect Valerie MacDonald from Salem leads us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

57
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The Pledge of Allegiance is the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

58
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.500
Please remain standing while the Franklin High School Choir sings our national anthem.

59
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500
Thank you.

60
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:15.000
Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

61
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.500
And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof to the night that our flag was still there.

62
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:35.500
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave for the land of the free and the home of the brave.

63
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.500
Thank you.

64
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.500
The House will attend to requests for leaves of absence.

65
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.500

Welcome to the New Hampshire House.

124
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Gracias.

125
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Good morning, members elect.

126
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.500
Welcome to the 168th session of the general court.

127
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:19.500
You have been chosen by the citizens of this state for a noble purpose.

128
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:33.000
We are experiencing one of the closest divisions ever known in this chamber, and it is my fervent hope that this chamber will rise to that occasion.

129
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.500
The seating for today was done purposely.

130
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:45.500
Granted it has been done this way in the past, distantly, but it is done for a convenience.

131
00:12:45.500 --> 00:13:03.500
It is done because we will be voting at various voting boxes, and historically, the names are mismatched, and people cross and trip over each other during the voting process, and we're trying to avoid that.

132
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:11.500
So, over in Division 1 and ending in Division 5 we have our A's through Z's.

133
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:19.500
So when the time comes for the voting procedures you will attend at the various boxes.

134
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:31.000
There's one up front here, one up front in the back, one up front in the back over here, and one down here.

135
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000
We will now begin the process of the calling of the roll.

136
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:44.500
The members elect are requested to remain in their seats and answer in firm voices.

137
00:13:44.500 --> 00:14:04.500
Members elect who do not answer will not be recorded as having been present and therefore will not be recorded as having taken the oath of office to be administered by the governor directly following this calling of the roll.

138
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.500
So members, please be in your seats at this time.

139
00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.500
This call will be taken alphabetically by county.

140
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
By county.

141
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:23.000
So if you're a Smith in Sullivan County, do not answer Smith for Belknap County.

142
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We will begin with Belknap County.

143
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Bean.

144
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000

Here.

152
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Heards.

153
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Here.

154
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Coker.

155
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Here.

156
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000

157
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000

430
00:26:49.500 --> 00:27:08.000

438
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:08.000
For those of you who are in your second term, welcome to Organization Day in the New Hampshire House Chamber.

439
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:17.000
At this time what will happen is the governor and council will make their way to the chamber.

440
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000
The sergeant-at-arms will introduce the executive council who will join me on the rostrum.

441
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Then the sergeant-at-arms will introduce His Excellency, the governor, who will proceed to swear you in.

442
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:40.500
At that time you should follow along with your oath slips that are in your seat pockets.

443
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:53.000
you have taken the oath, just a reminder, when the Executive Council and the Governor are introduced, we should stand and greet them as according.

444
00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:00.000
By the way, if we haven't discussed this already, turn them to silent, please.

445
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.500
If I hear one, I will know where it's coming from.

446
00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:14.500
I will look at you, and that is an automatic $25 donation to the New Hampshire Food Bank.

447

478
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.000
Please remain standing while the governor administers the oath of office.

479
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Good morning.

480
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Together again.

481
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
This is great.

482
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
This is absolutely terrific.

483
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Last year, or two years ago, when we had the swearing-in ceremony, as a lot of you remember, and for those who are new might not have been there, we were out in about 20-degree weather out on the field at UNH.

484
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Thank you.

485
00:31:43.000 --> 00:32:07.500
or two years ago when we had the swearing-in ceremony, as a lot of you remember, and for those who are new might not have been there, we were out in about 20-degree weather out on the field at UNH dealing with the COVID crisis and all of that.

486
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:18.500
But, you know, whether it's working with Republicans or working with Democrats or dealing through a pandemic, this body gets it done.

487
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:25.500
One way or the other, they always find a way to get it done.

488
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:40.500
And I think there's a huge lesson in that, right, not just for New Hampshire, but really for the rest of the country, that it isn't about partisanship and bickering.

489
00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:47.000
We have our heated arguments, of course, that's what we're here to do.

490
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.500
We're here to fight out our positions and represent our constituents.

491
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:59.000
But in New Hampshire, we always find a way to get it done.

492
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And to be back in this chamber, one of the most historic chambers in the country, is really, really awesome, especially for what we're doing today in terms of bringing in 400 new members.

493
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
399?

494
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
399 new members.

495
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.500
We've still got a tie.

496
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:26.000
We're going to work that one out.

497
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.500
To have 399 new members.

498
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:37.000
So if you will all follow me, first please raise your right hand and repeat after me.

499
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
I state your name.

500
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I state your name.

501
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000

503
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Of.

504
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Do solemnly swear.

505
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Do solemnly swear.

506
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
That I will bear faith in true allegiance.

507
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
That I will bear faith in true allegiance.

508
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
To the United States of America.

509
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
To the United States of America.

510
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
And the state of New Hampshire.

511
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
And the state of New Hampshire.

512
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
And will support the constitutions thereof.

513
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
So help me God.

514
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I, state your name.

515
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Do solemnly and sincerely.

516
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Swear and affirm.

517
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
That I will faithfully and impartially.

518
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Discharge and perform.

519
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:44.000
All the duties incumbent upon me as state representative according to the best of my abilities agreeably to the rules and regulations of this Constitution and the laws of the state of New Hampshire.

520
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So help me God.

521
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Congratulations.

522
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Good luck everybody.

523
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
All right, all right.

524
00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.500
Have him come up here.

525
00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:00.000
You're going to need to print out a couple of hooks.

526
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.500
So this man is going to print one out for you.

527
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.500
Watch out for you.

528
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.000
This is a little bit.

529
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.500
This is a little bit.

530
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.000
This is a little bit.

531
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I don't know.

532
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.500
No, I think it's a little bit.

533
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.500
Print print.

534
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.500
Print print.

535
00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.500
Print print.

536
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.500
Print print.

537
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.500
Print print.

538
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.500
Print print print.

539
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:43.000
Ladies and gentlemen, if you had any issues with the oath sheet, please come down to my left, your right, immediately.

540
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Thank you.

541
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.500
The House Clerk's Office staff will now come and please pass your oath slips to your right.

542
00:35:53.500 --> 00:36:01.000
And my staff will come and collect, except for those of you in Division 1.

543
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Right?

544
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
No, that's right.

545
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Yes.

546
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Pass to your right.

547
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Thank you.

548
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.500
I'm not in the position.

549
00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.000
I'm not in the position.

550
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.500
I'm not in the position.

551
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.500
Do the three judges have to sign it?

552
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.500
Yes, sir.

553
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.500
Thank you very much.

554
00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.500
You want it in the quaker?

555
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.500
Yes, sir.

556
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.000
Let's go back to you.

557
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
I'll call it.

558
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
I'll call it.

559
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
I'll call it.

560
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Thank you.

561
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.500
It's good to be back.

562
00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:47.000
Well, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations.

563
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:57.000
We just have a couple of technical issues to fix up here quickly, and we will be right with you.

564
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
But we will get right into the election of speaker.

565
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.500
The ground rules for that election were printed in your calendar.

566
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:13.000
If you have any questions about that, you're welcome to ask.

567
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000
But just if you could be patient for a couple of minutes while we get our oaths resolved.

568
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Thank you.

569
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
How are you?

570
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Representative Kelly, Eamon Kelly, are you all set?

571
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.500
You finally, it was under your, did you get it though?

572
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.500
I need you, come on up.

573
00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:49.500
I would like to thank Representative Thaxton for donating $25 to the New Hampshire Food Bank for his cell phone going off.

574
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.000
I mean, that whole thing is demon.

575
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Tell you what the one with an EY.

576
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.500
Is it, is it early?

577
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:02.000
It's like the whole time.

578
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
I just like going to the whole time.

579
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Thank you.

580
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
You guys are great.

581
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Thank you so much.

582
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Gracias.

583
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Thank you.

584
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000
The House will come to order.

585
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:31.500
The chair has proposed ground rules for election which have been reviewed by the candidates for speaker and has been printed in the House calendar.

586
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:38.500
Representatives Packard and Wilhelm move the adoption of the ground rules for the election.

587
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:44.000
The question is on the adoption of the rules for election.

588
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Are you ready for the question?

589
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
All those in favor say aye.

590
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Aye.

591
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
All those opposed nay.

592
00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:06.500
The ayes have have it and the rules for election have been adopted Nominations for the office of Speaker of the House are in order.

593
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:15.500
The chair recognizes the member from Concord, Representative Mary Jane Walner, for the purpose of making a nomination.

594
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.500
Thank you, Mr.

595
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.500
Clerk.

596
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:26.500
And good morning and congratulations to all the members of the New Hampshire House.

597
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.000
Today is an auspicious day for all of us.

598
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:39.500
For the first time in two years, we are beginning our term, return to this hallowed chamber.

599
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:49.000
Two years ago, we were opening the session outdoors in a field hockey field, and it was 20 degrees.

600
00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Inaugurably, the position of our nation and our chamber on that day in 2020 was historic, in the throes of an unprecedented global pandemic and a starkly polarized political climate.

601
00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Today in 2022, our country and our state are just as divided and the makeup of this chamber is equally as historic.

602
00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:29.000
We sit here today with the closest chamber party makeup in the history of the New Hampshire House and potentially the best opportunity for us to work together.

603
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.500
The best opportunity in our history for us to work together.

604
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:42.500
That is why I rise today to nominate Representative Matt Wilhelm for Speaker of the House.

605
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:51.000
For those that don't know me, I am entering my 22nd term in the New Hampshire House.

606
00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:01.000
I have served many of my over 40 years in the House in both committee leadership and as rank-and-file member.

607
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.500
It's true, every term presents new challenges for a legislature of this size.

608
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:20.000
I have served in the House under 15 speakers, each of them differently gifted as they took on the considerable responsibility of leading this body.

609
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.500
And what a considerable responsibility it is.

610
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:41.000
I have learned that a good speaker is someone who can be both bold and kind, not afraid to call out issues of decorum, but compassionate enough to care that every member's concerns are heard.

611
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.500
A good speaker, like a good representative, must have a humble servant's heart.

612
00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:56.500
A good speaker must put democracy and the institution before themselves, before ego, before personality, or political motive.

613
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:16.000
When you meet Matt, it is clear that he possesses all of these traits and is ideally poised to assume responsibility for our state's biggest challenges, as well as those we face within these historic walls of Representative Hall.

614
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.500
When you work with Matt, you can be confident that he deeply cares.

615
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:37.500
Coming from a background of service work, he speaks with principled conviction about the duty we hold to serve one another, to serve our state, and to serve our country.

616
00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:43.500
Matt knows innately how to negotiate difficult conversations, leaving everyone feeling understood.

617
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:48.000
He puts state before self and institution before ego.

618
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.500
Matt is wise enough to know when to ask for help and input.

619
00:42:54.500 --> 00:43:03.000
He seeks out guidance and as a speaker will devote himself to learning what he doesn't know.

620
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Matt wakes up thinking about how to better the institution and goes to bed considering the advice he heard throughout the day.

621
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
That's leadership.

622
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
That's a good speaker.

623
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:40.000
After four decades in this job and too many session days to count in this room, I can say that I am fully confident that Matt embodies the right recipe of integrity, empathy, idealism necessary to join the ranks of esteemed leaders before him.

624
00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:56.500
Instead of yielding to growing extremism and partisanship, we right now have the opportunity to elevate a new generation of leadership and bridge the divide we have for too long seen among us.

625
00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:08.500
With this in mind, I am honored to ask that you join me in electing Matt Wilhelm for Speaker of the New Hampshire House.

626
00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.500
Thank you.

627
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:18.000
Representative Mary Jane Walner places the name of Representative Matthew Wilhelm in nomination for speaker.

628
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:27.500
The chair recognizes the member from Kentuckuk, my rep, Representative Mel Myler for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

629
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:38.000
Colleagues, I rise today to second the nomination of Matt Wilhelm, who is Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

630
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.500
The Speaker of the House must represent all of us, regardless of our political party.

631
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.000
The position of Speaker is neither Republican nor Democrat.

632
00:44:50.000 --> 00:45:03.500
This hallowed Assembly needs a leader who is open to diverse opinions and fosters respect for civil discourse to finding the common ground resolution of complex issues.

633
00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:14.500
Leadership depends someone who will listen, who will learn, who will act, with respect for the individuals regardless of their partisan position.

634
00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.000
Matt Wilhelm is that leader.

635
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
He has a history of serving communities of multiple interests.

636
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:33.000
After graduating from Plymouth State, Matt moved to Manchester, where he served as an AmeriCorps team leader for City Year New Hampshire.

637
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:52.000
chargedged with the uniting America using uniting Americans from diverse backgrounds and walks of life, Matt led his peers through a challenging year of full-time volunteer service in some of the state's most highest need and underserved schools.

638
00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:01.000
He is committed to building a community of common interests, representing the common good of New Hampshire citizens.

639
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:09.500
He clearly is a servant leader, one who focuses on the needs of others than his own.

640
00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:16.500
Matt earned his master's degree in public administration at the University of New Hampshire.

641
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:27.000
He built a career in the nonprofit sector, leading nonpartisan teams to identify community challenges, solving problems, and getting things done.

642
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:39.500
He has stepped up during this period of hyper-partisanship to lead this body in building consensus, embracing innovation, and delivering results for all Granite Staters.

643
00:46:39.500 --> 00:47:07.000
Back in his first term, Matt introduced and passed a bipartisan piece of legislation, establishing a commission to study the workforce patterns of national service alumni so that they can be more service-driven and community- minded young people so that they can pursue a degree or a credential providing meaningful citizenship in the Granite State.

644
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Matt went on to chair this Commission and during the 1919 and 2020 session and we will be considering some of the issues that came out of that commission in this session.

645
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:35.500
Colleagues, no member of this body should ever feel intimidated or sanctioned because of your position on an issue or a vote before this assembly.

646
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:43.500
It is the speaker's responsibility to create a culture of inclusion and tolerance for diverse opinions.

647
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.500
It is time for a change.

648
00:47:46.500 --> 00:48:08.000
If you want a speaker that will respect you and your opinions, a speaker that will seek your input, a speaker that will have an open door to your ideas, a speaker who cares for the integrity of the process of this House.

649
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:22.500
If these are the issues that are important to you, then I encourage you to support and vote for Matt Wilhelm, Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

650
00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.500
Thank you, my colleagues and Mr.

651
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.500
Clerk.

652
00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:33.500
Representative Mel Myler seconds the nomination of Representative Matthew Wilhelm for Speaker.

653
00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:38.500
The chair recognizes the member from Manchester, Representative Matthew Wilhelm.

654
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:49.500
It is with great respect for this historic chamber and institution that I humbly accept this nomination for Speaker of the House.

655
00:48:49.500 --> 00:49:02.500
Like many of you, or your children or grandchildren, nieces and nephews, I first came to the House as a fourth grader up in the gallery.

656
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:08.500
We really won the jackpot because house was in session that day.

657
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.000
I remember how it feels.

658
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I remember how warm it was.

659
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
It was a late May afternoon.

660
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:25.500
I remember looking down and thinking to myself, it'd be pretty cool to serve here one day.

661
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:32.500
It's no secret that we're coming off a challenging term here in the House.

662
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:50.500
You either lived through it yourself or you were recruited to run because someone else had had enough or because you thought you could do a better job than the person in the seat before you.

663
00:49:50.500 --> 00:50:03.000
Colleagues whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, whether you were sworn in today for the first time, the 22nd time, or somewhere in between.

664
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:17.500
Granite Staters are counting on us, all of us, to reject trench warfare and ideological battles and instead come together and work together to deliver results for our neighbors.

665
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:37.000
We can do better and we must do better and with this chamber tied, nearly tied, between the minority and the majority, we have to be open to new approaches, new ideas, and new leadership to meet this moment.

666
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:44.000
And that's why I'm asking for your vote today for Speaker of the House.

667
00:50:44.000 --> 00:51:03.000
So while there may not be a Democratic mandate or a Republican mandate heading into this term, there is a uniquely granite state mandate to roll up our sleeves and work together to deal with some big issues.

668
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:20.500
challenges that previous legislatures have struggled to tackle, but that continue to get worse for families in my district and yours, kitchen table issues like the high cost of energy, housing, child care, and more.

669
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:35.000
Over the last several weeks, I've been sharing a series of proposals aimed at promoting unity and bipartisan cooperation, which I've also shared with my opponent in this race.

670
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.500
These proposals aim to curate a more productive work environment for all legislators, regardless of party affiliation.

671
00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:49.500
And I want to share some of those ideas with you today.

672
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:58.500
First, as Speaker, I will assign an even number of Democrats and Republicans to all 20 standing committees.

673
00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:08.000
Minority party committee assignments will be made not just with the advice but the consent of the minority leader.

674
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Where it's possible and it makes sense I will appoint Republican chairs and Democratic vice chair pairings as well as some Democratic chairs and Republican vice chair pairings.

675
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:44.500
As Speaker I will also ensure the total number of statutory and study committee assignments are balanced between the majority and the minority and that the total membership of the House Rules Committee and major statutory committees fiscal, JLCAR facilities are evenly balanced as well.

676
00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:59.000
Additionally, I will ensure that both the majority and the minority receive appointments to all committees of conference and can be removed with the concurrence of their respective leader.

677
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:10.500
As Speaker, I will create a bipartisan state budget process ruling amendments that add unrelated policy issues to the state budget as non-germain.

678
00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:22.500
As Speaker, I will ensure transparency in our scheduling, providing significant notice prior to upcoming session days and prioritizing consistency in committee meeting schedules.

679
00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:39.500
As Speaker, I will also support a House rule authorizing members who are absent due to medical condition, illness, or illness in the family to cast votes through a proxy in full House sessions.

680
00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:46.000
We have members absent today who tested positive earlier this week for COVID-19.

681
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Other members may feel pressure this to roll up even when they're sick because the numbers are just that close.

682
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Let's prioritize the health and safety of one another and our families.

683
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.500
It's simply the right thing to do.

684
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:14.500
As Speaker, I will work with both caucuses to provide an opportunity for mixed seating in Division 3.

685
00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:30.000
Based on demand, we'll seat a limited number of Republicans and Democrats side by side in hopes of providing space that members can deepen relationships and build bridges across party lines.

686
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:47.000
I also want to put my experience in nonpartisan nonprofit administration to work by building on next week's Braver Angels workshop and introducing a new tradition to the Chamber, the Martin Luther King Jr.

687
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Day of Service.

688
00:54:49.000 --> 00:55:00.000
As Speaker, I will establish a bipartisan special committee, in fact two of them, to tackle the biggest challenges facing our state.

689
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
First, we'll establish a special committee on housing.

690
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Our businesses need workers and our workforce need a place to live.

691
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:14.500
We will get this done in the new year.

692
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:19.500
I also want to create a special committee on childcare.

693
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:38.000
The availability of quality, affordable, safe, and reliable childcare is critical for parents, especially women who are more likely than men to quit their job during the pandemic, to either return to or remain in the workforce.

694
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:48.500
We can do hard things when we work together, and New Hampshire families are counting on us to do just that.

695
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:58.000
When we do, I am confident that it will prove to be not only good policymaking, but good politics.

696
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:13.500
Colleagues, we have an opportunity to meet this moment and bring back balance to the New Hampshire House, but to do so, we must summon the courage to try something new.

697
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:28.000
As a fourth grader, I looked down from the House gallery and wondered if one day I might have the opportunity to serve my community in this historic chamber.

698
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Thirty years later, I stand before you as a candidate for speaker, asking you to believe in our collective power, to turn the page, and to begin writing a new chapter together.

699
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Regardless of party, I humbly ask for your vote today.

700
00:56:49.000 --> 00:57:05.500
Thank you Representative Wilhelm accepts the nomination further nominations are in order the chair recognizes the member from Londonderry representative Wayne McDonald for the purpose of making a nomination Thank Thank you, Mr.

701
00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.500
Clerk.

702
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:22.000
Colleagues and fellow citizens, I have the high honor and the great privilege to rise today to nominate Sherman Packard for Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

703
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
I have known Sherm for over 30 years.

704
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:39.000
I have known him as a good friend, fellow citizen of Londonderry, and most relevant to our gathering here today, a veteran member of this body.

705
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Sherm was first elected to the House in in 1990 and was recently re-elected to his 17th term.

706
00:57:48.000 --> 00:58:00.000
This speaks volumes as to his commitment to this institution, its procedures, its mission, and his love for the people of our great state.

707
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:21.500
He has sponsored many good pieces of legislation during his time here and has served as the chairman of committees, deputy minority leader, as minority leader, as speaker pro tem, deputy speaker, and as we all know for these past two years, speaker.

708
00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:39.000
I believe that it's important as we discuss this important office today, we remember Sherm did not originally set out to be Speaker when we met in an athletic field at UNH two years ago.

709
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:52.000
On that bright, sunny, and cold day, he planned to serve as deputy speaker in the administration of his good friend, Representative Dick Hinch of Merrimack.

710
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.500
We elected Dick speaker that day, and we all looked forward to a productive term.

711
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:09.000
As we remember all too well, things tragically changed very unexpectedly just one week later with Speaker Hinch's passing.

712
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:28.000
As if the challenges of the pandemic and the need to get the business of the House done weren't challenging enough in a partnership with Speaker Hinch, Sherm was now suddenly thrust into the role of acting speaker.

713
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:37.500
No one could have been better prepared to assume the responsibilities of the office at such a challenging time.

714
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:41.500
His many years of experience were clearly demonstrated.

715
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:54.000
He ably led us through the next several weeks to Constitution Day on January 6, 2021, when he was elected speaker for the upcoming term.

716
00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:02.500
Speaker Packard, the House leadership team, and the House staff proceeded to get the people's business done.

717
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:20.500
Realizing the pandemic and the state of emergency we were operating under at the time prevented us from meeting in this chamber, alternate sites were found where social distancing and other health precautions could be taken.

718
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:26.000
Committees met in hybrid fashion, and all House deadlines were kept.

719
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Eventually, things got back to normal.

720
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Colleagues, I realize that there are members of two great political parties gathered here in this chamber today, each with their own noble beliefs, principles, traditions, and objectives.

721
01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:53.000
There is much for us to disagree about, and that will be demonstrated many times in these next two years.

722
01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000
However, I hope we will always be proud of what our two parties did on September 15th of this year.

723
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:17.500
We came together in the true spirit of compromise and bipartisanship, suspended the House rules, and passed legislation to help income-eligible families make it through this current heating season.

724
01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:19.500
The legislation wasn't perfect.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

725
01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:26.500
It's something that Democrats and their leadership can be proud of and made happen.

726
01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:33.000
It's something that Republicans can be proud of and our leadership made happen.

727
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Colleagues, I ask that you re-elect Sherman Packard, Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives.

728
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Thank you very much.

729
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Representative Wayne McDonald places the name of Representative Sherman Packard in nomination for speaker.

730
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:58.500
The chair recognizes the member from Wilton, Representative Jim Kofalt, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

731
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500
Thank you, Mr.

732
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:02.500
Clerk.

733
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:10.500
I think my good colleague from Londonderry covered pretty much everything I would want to say.

734
01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:22.000
This body has been fairly closely divided over the past two years, as it's much more closely divided for the coming two years.

735
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:34.500
I think that this is a time to have somebody who can bring people together in a spirit of cooperation and collaboration and effective leadership.

736
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:52.500
So I will keep my comments brief and simply say that I would ask you to support Sherm Packard as our speaker for the next two years and I would like to formally second his nomination.

737
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.500
Thank you, Mr.

738
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.500
Clerk.

739
01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.500
Representative Jim Cofalt seconds the nomination of Representative Sherman Packard.

740
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:05.000
The chair recognizes the member from Bedford.

741
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Representative Lori Sanborn for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

742
01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Good morning.

743
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Thank you, Mr.

744
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:22.500
Chair, and thanks to all of you for being here for today and for choosing to serve.

745
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:30.500
I rise to second the nomination of Sherman Packard for Speaker of the New Hampshire House.

746
01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.500
Why?

747
01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:47.000
Because of his vast experience, because of his proven skills and knowledge, because of his respect for all of you, and because of his respect for this great institution.

748
01:03:47.000 --> 01:04:00.000
SHRM has led a lifetime of service, with over 30 years here as a representative, plus decades of service in his community and to charity organizations.

749
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.500
He is never boastful, because it's never about him.

750
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:13.000
For SHRM, it's always about serving you, the members, and about serving the people of New Hampshire.

751
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
In fact, I'd call his leadership style a servant leadership.

752
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:23.500
Leaders with this style serve their teams and their organization first.

753
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:29.500
They don't prioritize their own objectives or work for their own glory.

754
01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:36.500
Employees and members feel their voices are actually heard under this type of leadership.

755
01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:48.000
And I can tell you personally I've worked closely with Sherm over many years and it's been an absolute pleasure and an honor.

756
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:59.000
With his open-door policy Sherm Packard has made it clear that the speaker's office will be a nonpartisan office for all members.

757
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:13.500
Working together has always been at the forefront of his mind, and as we begin this new term, you will see it be the forefront of a Packard administration.

758
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:40.500
As a small business owner, SHRM has a unique perspective on how to effectively manage the day-to-day activities of this House, whether it's coordinating House sessions and calendars to dealing with personnel issues and listening to member concerns, all while making sure the legislature and its business gets done under deadline and on time.

759
01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:54.000
And as we work through this past legislative term, SHRM's extensive experience, not only as House Speaker but as a representative, helped the House navigate unprecedented times.

760
01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:03.000
But even through this difficulty, the legislature continued to do the work for the people of New Hampshire.

761
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:25.000
If you want a speaker who will respect you and who will always demonstrate respect for this great institution with professionalism, competence, compassion, and grace, I would ask you to join me in voting for Sherman Packard for Speaker of the New Hampshire House.

762
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Representative Lori Sanborn seconds the nomination of Representative Sherman Packard.

763
01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
The chair recognizes the member from Londonderry, Representative Sherman Packard.

764
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Thank you, Mr.

765
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Clerk.

766
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.500
Fellow House members, I accept the nomination.

767
01:06:42.500 --> 01:07:01.500
We may disagree on policy approaches, but we are all united in the belief that New Hampshire is one of the best places in which to live, work, raise a family, start a business, and so much more.

768
01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:10.500
As a lifelong resident of this beautiful state, I raised a beautiful family, ran a small, successful business.

769
01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:14.000
Now I'm blessed with three wonderful grandchildren.

770
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
The next generation.

771
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:26.500
The next generation to stand up and preserve the ideals that make our state, our country, uniquely rugged, independent, and free.

772
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:31.000
This is why public service is important to me.

773
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:39.500
It's why I wake up every day and come to this sacred building for $125 a year.

774
01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:44.000
Yes, the speaker gets an extra $25 a year.

775
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Over the last two years, this institution has faced some unprecedented challenges.

776
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.500
These challenges often brought out the best in us.

777
01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:58.500
I believe we have emerged a stronger institution.

778
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:19.000
The key to us being stronger today than we were in 2020 is a result of striking a balance, working together, finding solutions to problems in a manner that suits the needs of the broad spectrum of opinions in this House.

779
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000
And that's what really our new challenge is for the new term.

780
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
The voters sent us here with a never-before-seen balance in partisan makeup.

781
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:47.000
And the only way we can forge ahead and be successful in this environment is by working together, building consensus among our members of both parties across a broad spectrum of members.

782
01:08:47.000 --> 01:09:02.500
Over the last few weeks, I have had the opportunity to meet with Representative Wilhelm to identify areas where we agree we can build stronger relationships and processes in the House.

783
01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:10.500
In fact, on Monday, we revealed a four-page document outlining some of these ideas to consider.

784
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:27.000
I'm happy to report that we already have several key areas where we reach conceptual agreement on the way we do things around here, and we can move forward on those very soon.

785
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:35.500
We also have a list of administrative items we are actively discussing and exploring paths to consensus.

786
01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:47.000
I'm looking forward to continuing those discussions in the coming days and weeks to make sure we are putting our best ideas forward.

787
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Together, Representative Wilhelm and I are working on these important issues for the House.

788
01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.500
Whether my party has 201 or 220 or something in between, please know.

789
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:08.500
The House Speaker serves all the members of all parties, and I take that very seriously.

790
01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:19.000
For those of you who have worked with me over the last two years, you know my door was always open.

791
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:27.500
Everyone had a seat at the table and I always approached each day with an open mind.

792
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:44.500
For those of you who I haven't had the chance to work with, please know that I come to this new term with that same approach, with an open door and an open mind.

793
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:48.000
We will always have disagreements on policy.

794
01:10:48.000 --> 01:11:02.500
We may not see eye to eye on some processes, but I will always treat each of you with the respect and dignity and the office you hold deserves.

795
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:12.000
You represent the people of your district, and your public service gives them a voice here in the Statehouse.

796
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000
It's an awesome duty and responsibility.

797
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:20.000
The famous words of Thomas Jefferson still ring true today.

798
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:34.500
In support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

799
01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:52.000
To that respect, with the divisions and polarization we experienced as a result of not being in the same room and as each other for too long, we need to return to decorum and civility.

800
01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:07.000
We need to look each other in the eye and show that respect and dignity to our fellow legislators enact in ways that honors our constituents and this great institution.

801
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:22.500
I believe with tolerance and respect we can work together, right here in this historic chamber, in our committee business, in our debates, our interactions over the course of the term.

802
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:36.500
Standing here with all of you is a reminder to how great this state is and how much we can do when we set aside our political differences.

803
01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:45.500
As citizens of this state, we understand the importance of doing things our way, the New Hampshire way.

804
01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:59.500
I want to close with some words from my dear friend and predecessor, Speaker Dick Hinch, which he included in the calendar notice two years ago this week.

805
01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:13.000
I ask each of you not to look at each other, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as friends and colleagues, working together towards the same goal.

806
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:21.000
We have a responsibility to respect each other, work with each other, and understand each other.

807
01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.500
We are all here to make a positive difference in our communities and our state.

808
01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:40.500
We may have different ideas, but we all want to do what we believe is right, and there's nothing political or partisan about that.

809
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.500
Thank you.

810
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:45.000
Representative Packard accepts the nomination.

811
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:51.500
The chair being aware of no further nominations, the chair closes the nominations.

812
01:13:51.500 --> 01:14:02.500
At this time, the sergeant at arms will escort all members into the chamber so that we can begin the voting process.

813
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:11.500
All members shall be escorted into the chamber for the voting process members should take their seats Gracias.

814
01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:15.000
The balloting procedure will be as follows.

815
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Those that need assistance from the chair, I will come and cast your ballot for you.

816
01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000
I will pick that ballot up and deliver it on your behalf.

817
01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:33.500
So please indicate that when the balloting is open.

818
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:36.500
Balloting will be done by division.

819
01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:41.000
When you have marked your ballot, please remain seated.

820
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I will call each division individually.

821
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:52.000
There are two ballot boxes in the front of the chamber and two in the rear.

822
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Number one is on your left near the chamber door and is for ATE.

823
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Thank you.

824
01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:09.000
There are two ballot boxes in the front of the chamber and two in the rear.

825
01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Number one is on your left near the chamber door and is for A to E.

826
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.500
Number two is in the back on the left and is for F through L.

827
01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:32.000
Number three is in the back to your right and is for M through P.

828
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.500
Number four is on the right and in the front and that is for Q through Z.

829
01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:45.500
It is important that you use the correct ballot box.

830
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:54.500
Staff members from the House Clerk's Office and the Republican and Democratic offices are stationed at each box.

831
01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:14.000
Before you deposit your ballot in the box, please clearly state your name so the staff person can check you off the list, and the partisan staffer will lift up their arms so that you can cast your ballot.

832
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:31.000
For ease of traffic flow in the front and back, please do not leave your seat until your division is called, then please return to your seat via an aisle away from your division.

833
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:44.000
The ballot clerks for the election of the speaker, Box 1, A through E, from the clerk's office, Paul Bryant, from the Republican Office, Jeremy Baker.

834
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.500
From Box 2, from the Clerk's Office, Michael Coe, and the Republican Office, Meg Stone.

835
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:59.500
For Box 3, Teresa Preston from the Clerk's Office and Rachel Cole from the Democratic Office.

836
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:08.000
And for Box 4, Gail Middleton from the Clerk's Office and Slate Goodwin for the Democratic Office.

837
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Each candidate has named two tellers that will be responsible for counting the ballots at the conclusion and the chair likewise appoints two tellers.

838
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.500
The members themselves will do the counting.

839
01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:28.500
The clerk's staff will deposit the ballots on the tables.

840
01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:35.000
The members who are the tellers will then separate the ballots into stacks.

841
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
We have four stacks.

842
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.500
Packard stack, Wilhelm stack, write-in stack, blank ballot stack.

843
01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:45.000
Blank ballots that are cast do count.

844
01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:52.000
A majority of ballot count cast is required for a selection of a winner.

845
01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:06.000
The tellers for the election of speaker, representatives Stephen Smith and Sanborn for Packard, representatives Talersky and Adjutant for Wilhelm, and the chair appoints representatives Hunt and Schuett.

846
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.500
At this time, the clerk staff will distribute ballots.

847
01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:12.500
Thank you.

848
01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:18.000
If there are extras, please hand them back to the staff.

849
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:39.500
Ladies and gentlemen, just so you know, if we are required to take any roll call votes today for any potential motions that might come up, it will be done in the same manner as the original call of the roll this morning.

850
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.500
That is a verbal roll call.

851
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.500
So please be aware of that.

852
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:47.500
Thank you.

853
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.500
Thank you, Representative Mangiaputi.

854
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.000
Has everyone received their ballot?

855
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.000
Please raise your hand if you have not.

856
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000
At this time, please fill out your ballots.

857
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:08.500
And if I could have the staff go to their respective boxes, please, for the next part.

858
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.500
Thank you.

859
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:18.500
All right, at this time, are there members that require my assistance in casting their ballot?

860
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:21.500
Okay, I will be right there.

861
01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:23.500
Thank you.

862
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:29.000
Are there any other members that need assistance in casting ballots?

863
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
Last call.

864
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
All right.

865
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:41.000
At this time, Divisions 1 and Division 5, please rise and begin to cast your ballots.

866
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
All other members should remain in their seats.

867
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.500
Please return to your seat as soon as you have cast your ballot.

868
01:19:51.500 --> 01:20:00.000
I would suggest exiting to your right to form a line and then returning via the left.

869
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.500
Should have said that first.

870
01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.500
Thank you.

871
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.500
Gracias.

872
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.500
Thank you.

873
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.500
Thank you.

874
01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:15.500
Members should remain in the chamber during the balloting process.

875
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.500
Thank you.

876
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:23.500
Members should return to their seats once they have cast a ballot.

877
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:30.000
With my apologies to the leadership teams seated in Division 2 and four.

878
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
I'm breaking with tradition.

879
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Division three, you're up.

880
01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Gracias.

881
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
Thank you.

882
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Thank you.

883
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
.

884
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Ah, not to walk around on a watch.

885
01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Thank you.

886
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Excuse me.

887
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I stepped away.

888
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.500
Otherwise, you're going to need to move through here.

889
01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.500
Yes.

890
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.500
I represent my life.

891
01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:02.500
I represent my life.

892
01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:04.500
Thank you.

893
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.500
.

894
01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.500
Thank you.

895
01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:12.500
I can't remember where the paper count is.

896
01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.500
I know.

897
01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.500
Thank you.

898
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:18.500
Thank you.

899
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.500
Thank you.

900
01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:31.000
Okay, if those who have voted can please return to their seats so we can have the next group vote, please.

901
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.500
If you have voted, please return to your seats.

902
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:39.000
Do not hang out in the aisles.

903
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
All right.

904
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:47.500
Just like my daughter's four-year-old recital the other night, it was organized chaos.

905
01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:49.500
So I do apologize.

906
01:21:49.500 --> 01:22:00.000
My plan was to have this be disorganized and not chaotic, but apparently you know what they say about good intentions.

907
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.500
So at this time, would Divisions 2 and 4 please cast their ballots?

908
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.500
Thank you.

909
01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.500
Thank you.

910
01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:12.500
How are you?

911
01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:15.500
And you're not good to see.

912
01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:19.000
Wait, did I forget what that happened?

913
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Is that hysterically funny?

914
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.500
Is that a good person?

915
01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:31.500
I think he should look at him with the attention and be like, hey, I'm famous.

916
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:33.500
Yeah.

917
01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.500
What's his name again?

918
01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.500
Yoshi's name.

919
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500
Thank you.

920
01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:41.500
What's his name again?

921
01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:46.000
My daughter's Catholic because we're here and she's here.

922
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:53.500
And I went to visit her in like two or three weeks after she's here.

923
01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:59.500
And the clown was like, I'm going to send this kids away.

924
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.500
She's like, no.

925
01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:05.000
I used to give them a treat.

926
01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
She doesn't get older.

927
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.500
And, but now it's like when I visit her, she's here.

928
01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:14.500
She's my daughter.

929
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.500
Uh huh.

930
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:18.500
Oh really?

931
01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:20.500
Thank you.

932
01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.500
Oh, really?

933
01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:24.500
Oh, really?

934
01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.000
I think it's a separate.

935
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.500
I got an interesting thing.

936
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.500
Thanks.

937
01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:33.500
Yeah.

938
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:36.000
Did you change the thing?

939
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
Yeah.

940
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Yeah.

941
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.500
Hi, it's good to see you, Mom.

942
01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.500
Congratulations.

943
01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.500
How's it going?

944
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.500
Oh, Mom, this is Anita Burrow.

945
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:52.500
He's on the PFAS.

946
01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.500
Yeah.

947
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:56.500
Yeah.

948
01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500
Yeah.

949
01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:00.500
Yeah.

950
01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.500
No, that's good.

951
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.500
That's okay.

952
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:06.500
Oh, good, good.

953
01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.500
Yeah.

954
01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:11.000
I'm just coming out here.

955
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:18.500
All the new things I need to do, we're in the 2011, the third floor.

956
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:20.500
I just sit down.

957
01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:24.000
I'm going to go to the floor.

958
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Good, yes.

959
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
That's a good idea.

960
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:33.500
Yeah, but the way you're here, you can hardly get in.

961
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:38.000
You know, like through the door, it's really old.

962
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
But upstairs, or downstairs.

963
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
I know.

964
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Thank you.

965
01:24:44.000 --> 01:25:12.500
I haven't heard any of Russell's about, I mean, last week, I just saw a bunch of, there was a lot of people who were sending me in, and I was just really in the report that he was saying, he had the other people who were reporting to be the other people who were talking about.

966
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:17.500
Yeah, yeah, and you know, if you know, Thank you.

967
01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:22.000
Members, please take your seats once you have voted.

968
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
Do not stand in the corners and chit-chat.

969
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.500
The faster we get through this, the faster we move on.

970
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.500
Thank you.

971
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.500
Okay, I'll let you know where.

972
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.500
All right.

973
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.500
Have all members voted?

974
01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.500
Have all members voted?

975
01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:45.000
Members, take your seats please.

976
01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Members, take your seats.

977
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
The main highway here?

978
01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.500
I'm not, but you are.

979
01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.500
That's why I didn't give up.

980
01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.500
.

981
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.500
.

982
01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:04.000
Staff at the ballot boxes, has everybody in your lines dissipated?

983
01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Good.

984
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
I hereby declare the ballot closed.

985
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:15.500
At this time, the ballot boxes in the rear will be brought forward.

986
01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.500
The tellers should please come forward.

987
01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.000
One teller for each side.

988
01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:31.500
So Representative Stephen Smith over here, Representative Sanborn here, Representative Talerski here, Representative Adjutant here, Representative Hunt here, Representative Schuett here.

989
01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:37.500
Just a reminder, there are no snacks permitted on the House floor.

990
01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:43.000
There is water permitted on the House floor, but no snacks.

991
01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Now, here's what's going to happen.

992
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.500
The ballot boxes are going to be emptied onto the tables.

993
01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:58.000
The tellers will look and make sure that the ballot boxes are empty.

994
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.500
The tellers will then sort into their respective piles.

995
01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:08.500
The House will be in a brief recess while the counting happens.

996
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:16.000
That being said, if any member chooses to leave, you must go through the back.

997
01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.500
I don't want any other members up here peering.

998
01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:22.500
Thank you.

999
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.500
Okay.

1000
01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.500
Obrigado.

1001
01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:28.500
Thank you.

1002
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:37.000
for those of you who are asking or are in the gallery, we will continue right through.

1003
01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.000
So following this, we have election of two House officers.

1004
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.500
Both of those are uncontested.

1005
01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:57.500
We will then go into joint convention for the purposes of electing the Secretary of State and State Treasurer, and we will come out of that.

1006
01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.000
We do not anticipate breaking for lunch.

1007
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Thank you.

1008
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Thank you.

1009
01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
Obrigado.

1010
01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
Thank you.

1011
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Thank you.

1012
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
and .

1013
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Here.

1014
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
I know.

1015
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Thank you.

1016
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Thank you.

1017
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Gracias.

1018
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
Thank you.

1019
01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Thank you.

1020
01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Gracias.

1021
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Thank you.

1022
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Thank you.

1023
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
That's right.

1024
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Thank you.

1025
01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:40.000
The House will come to order.

1026
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.500
Members should take their seats so I can make the announcement of results.

1027
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.500
Thank you.

1028
01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:54.500
Members, please take your seats so that I can announce the results.

1029
01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:56.500
Thank you.

1030
01:28:56.500 --> 01:29:02.000
Members take your seats so that I may announce results please.

1031
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Thank you.

1032
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
Gracias.

1033
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.500
The House will attend to a communication.

1034
01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:13.500
In a communication dated December 7, 2022, Mr.

1035
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:30.500
Paul Smith, Clerk of the House, Dear Paul, please be advised that the following representative-elect was sworn into office by the governor and council on this day, representing Belknap County District 4, Travis J.

1036
01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:32.500
O'Hara.

1037
01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:34.500
Representative, welcome.

1038
01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:44.500
Representative O'Hara did not participate in the vote as he was not sworn until after the ballots had been closed.

1039
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:47.000
So, just for your information.

1040
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000
All right.

1041
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
The House will come to order.

1042
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
With 391 ballots cast, 196 were necessary for the election.

1043
01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.500
There were zero write-in votes.

1044
01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:02.500
There were two blank ballots cast.

1045
01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.500
Representative Matthew Wilhelm received 184 votes.

1046
01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.000
Representative Packard received 205 votes.

1047
01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.500
The representative from Londonderry is elected the Speaker of the House.

1048
01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500
Gracias.

1049
01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.500
First of all, I want to thank everybody.

1050
01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:27.000
It was a tremendous honor two years ago, and it is a tremendous honor again.

1051
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
I love this institution.

1052
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:41.000
I still get goosebumps every time I walk through the door because obviously none of us do this for the money in this chamber.

1053
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:48.000
But I've been here 32 years and it still means the world to me.

1054
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And being back here as Speaker really means the world to me.

1055
01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.500
We've got a lot of work to do over the next two years.

1056
01:31:00.500 --> 01:31:20.500
And as I said earlier, I firmly believe that we can do that work and get it accomplished, and we can pass a good budget, and we can pass a good capital budget, and we can get some good legislation.

1057
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:25.500
Eighty-five percent of the legislation we do usually is bipartisan.

1058
01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.000
So let's get to work.

1059
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:42.500
Within the next couple of weeks, everybody will have their committee assignments, their seating assignments, their parking assignments, and come January, we'll be ready to hit the ground running.

1060
01:31:42.500 --> 01:31:44.500
Thank you all.

1061
01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.500
Thank you again.

1062
01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.500
Thank you.

1063
01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.500
Thank you.

1064
01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:59.000
Before I recognize you, Representative, I hereby appoint Representative Osborne and Wilhelm, leaders of their respective caucuses.

1065
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Thank you, Mr.

1066
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
Speaker.

1067
01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:13.000
I want to move that your remarks be moved to the Permanent Journal and congratulate you on your victory today.

1068
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Thank you.

1069
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
The President.

1070
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Without objection, so ordered.

1071
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.000
The House will come to order.

1072
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
The House will proceed with the election of House officers.

1073
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Nominations for clerk.

1074
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Chair recognizes Representative Mooney.

1075
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Thank you, Mr.

1076
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Speaker, and good afternoon to my colleagues in the New Hampshire House.

1077
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:49.500
I rise to place the name of Paul Smith of Hopkington to the position of clerk of the New Hampshire House.

1078
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:53.500
Now Paul and I go back a ways.

1079
01:32:53.500 --> 01:33:00.000
We were first elected as freshmen to this house in the year 2002.

1080
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I have the blue book with me at my seat from that time period.

1081
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:18.500
Amazingly, if you look at our photos in the book, you'll quickly discover that we look now exactly as we did in 2002.

1082
01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.500
We haven't changed one bit, not a bit.

1083
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:33.500
It's evident that to manage, advise, and direct the third largest English-speaking legislative body in the world that the following are essential.

1084
01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.500
Expertise, temperament, and accessibility.

1085
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:39.500
Paul has all of these and far more.

1086
01:33:39.500 --> 01:33:48.500
As an expert, he's been on the State House staff since 2005 and a clerk's office since 2011.

1087
01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:54.500
He serves on the Mason's Manual Commission, now as its vice chair.

1088
01:33:54.500 --> 01:34:02.000
And he's considered by other house clerks nationwide as a foremost authority on parliamentary procedure.

1089
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:17.000
His temperament has been tried and tested, especially this past legislative session, taking this legislative body on the road to UNH Sports Field, Bedford Sports Plex, and Manchester's Doubletree Hotel.

1090
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.500
Each session run with precision and professionalism.

1091
01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:33.000
Paul's accessibility is around the clock with virtually unlimited access to him for a question or a clarification or whatever else a member may need.

1092
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.500
Please continue Paul in his role of clerk by voting for his nomination.

1093
01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:42.000
Thank you for your attention.

1094
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.500
You forgot to mention our infamous drive-in.

1095
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:54.000
The chair recognizes a member from Hopkinton, Senator David Luno for the purpose of second and nomination.

1096
01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1097
01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.500
Speaker.

1098
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:07.500
And I second the nomination of my friend Paul Smith to be clerk of the New Hampshire House.

1099
01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:24.500
I can't really add too much to what Representative Mooney just spoke of, other than Paul gives all of us his cell phone number with the instructions to call him any time of day.

1100
01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:37.500
And there are times when we're working late and need to draw on his knowledge and experience, which is significant, and Paul is there for us.

1101
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:46.000
So please support my friend Paul Smith to be our next clerk of the New Hampshire House.

1102
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1103
01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.500
Speaker.

1104
01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.000
Are there any further nominations?

1105
01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:00.000
That being none, I declare nominations closed and cast one ballot for Paul C.

1106
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:08.000
Smith, declare him the duly elected clerk of the House for the 23-24 biennium Thank you.

1107
01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Thank you.

1108
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Thank you.

1109
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Thank you.

1110
01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Thank you.

1111
01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
Thank you.

1112
01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Thank you.

1113
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
Thank you.

1114
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Thank you.

1115
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Thank you.

1116
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Thank you.

1117
01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Thank you.

1118
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Thank you.

1119
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Thank you.

1120
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.500
Thank you very much for this honor.

1121
01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.500
As most of you know, this is my dream job.

1122
01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:51.500
I love this job and I can't imagine myself doing anything else but being here to serve you.

1123
01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.500
That is correct.

1124
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:56.500
You have my cell phone number.

1125
01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:08.500
My wife who is with us in the gallery today does not always appreciate when I get calls on weekends but I do answer.

1126
01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.000
So please feel free to call me.

1127
01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
I would just note that yes Representative Mooney was right.

1128
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:35.000
20 years ago nearly this day, I was sworn in as a member of this house, and my mom, who is with us in the gallery today, yes, that's a bingo for someone, is here again.

1129
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:45.000
So very much thanks, Mom, and thanks to my wife, Jen, for their support and love, and thank you all.

1130
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.500
I look forward to continuing to work with you.

1131
01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:55.000
Nominations for the position of the House Sergeant-in-Arms are in order.

1132
01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:03.500
The chair recognizes a member from Kingston, Representative Ken Wyler, for the purpose of making a nomination.

1133
01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.500
Thank you, Mr.

1134
01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.500
Speaker.

1135
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:10.500
I don't see, there he is.

1136
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.500
Is J.B.

1137
01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.500
here today?

1138
01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:16.500
Yes, he is.

1139
01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.000
I rise to nominate J.B.

1140
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.500
Cullen for Sergeant at Arms for the 2023-2024 term.

1141
01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:30.000
We who were here last term can attest to his professionalism and thoroughness.

1142
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:41.500
He is the quiet man who stands by the door and quietly signals to his able staff when to shut the back doors.

1143
01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:51.000
This man and his crew keep us safe from unauthorized people wandering into this chamber to disrupt our deliberations.

1144
01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:00.500
The staff are the ones who assure the latest amendment is in your seat back when they are needed.

1145
01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:10.500
If any one of us had an emergency, they would be the first to notice it and take appropriate action.

1146
01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:32.500
JB is an educated man with a master's in forestry, still teaches it a little bit part-time, but he now turns his attention to our safety and the training of a competent staff and the preparation for any emergency that might threaten our proceedings.

1147
01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:39.000
We are so quietly and thoroughly cared for that it is almost imperceptible.

1148
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:55.500
So I ask you now to take a look at the quiet man by the door, give he and his staff a round of applause, and vote for him for Sergeant at Arms.

1149
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.500
Thank you.

1150
01:39:57.500 --> 01:40:06.500
The chair recognizes the member from Concord to represent Timothy Susti for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1151
01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.500
Thank you, Mr.

1152
01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:15.000
Speaker, and lucky for all of you, I'm a man of few words.

1153
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:43.000
And I did tell JB today that I would be quick, and my friend from Kingston stated that nomination so eloquently that I really have nothing to add other than he is a very humble man, been here for Sergeant at Arms for four years, so I would urge you to cast that vote for J.B.

1154
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000
Cullen.

1155
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000
Thank you.

1156
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000

Just remember that.

1313
01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Good Catholic education.

1314
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000

1315
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Does it every time.

1316
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Mr.

1317
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Speaker, I'm here to place in nomination the name of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1318
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Now I'm going to be a little historian here for my colleagues.

1319
01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
50 years ago, I sat in seat 383 in December of 1972.

1320
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
And I voted for the Secretary of State, Bob Stock.

1321
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:42.500
Bob Stock was a wonderful Secretary of State and a great human being.

1322
01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:49.500
And he set the stage and he set the ceiling for Secretaries of State.

1323
01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:56.500
Bob Stock passed away as Secretary of State and was succeeded by Ed Kelly.

1324
01:50:56.500 --> 01:50:58.500
Ed Kelly was super.

1325
01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:11.000
Again, following that Max tradition of doing the right thing at the right time and being responsive to everybody, everybody, in a very non-partisan manner.

1326
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:19.500
Ed Kelly was succeeded by one of my students, a Bishop Bradley High School graduate, Bill Gardner.

1327
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.000
Bill Gardner stayed there for 40 years.

1328
01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:26.000
It was like a permanent job.

1329
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.500
Never mind TDY as we do in the military.

1330
01:51:30.500 --> 01:51:32.500
This was permanent.

1331
01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.500
Bill Gardner.

1332
01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:39.000
Bill Gardner left and was succeeded by Dave Scanlon.

1333
01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
Dave is in the image and likeness of his precursors.

1334
01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.000
The Secretary of State has an enormous responsibility.

1335
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:51.000
It's not just the election process.

1336
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:58.000
It's a number of other items that have to be run efficiently and effectively.

1337
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
Dave has done that.

1338
01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Now, nobody's perfect.

1339
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I understand that.

1340
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.500
I look at myself in the mirror and say, nobody's perfect.

1341
01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:15.500
But indeed, we all have an opportunity to do the right thing.

1342
01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:18.500
And Dave Scanlon has done that.

1343
01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:24.000
He's done that for his constituency, which is you and me.

1344
01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
We are his constituents.

1345
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000
The state of New Hampshire is his constituency.

1346
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.500
And he's done well by his constituency.

1347
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:42.500
I would hope that this body votes positively for Dave and puts him back as Secretary of State.

1348
01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:45.000
It's an enormously important job.

1349
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:53.500
It's a job that we need to be done properly, effectively, because it's in our best interest.

1350
01:52:53.500 --> 01:53:04.500
It serves the people of the state of New Hampshire effectively, efficiently, and it does what we all want, the right thing.

1351
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:07.000
So thank you, my colleagues.

1352
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:17.500
It's been an honor and a privilege to nominate, and I indeed hope that we'll come up with the right response.

1353
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:22.000
Thank you, and everybody have a great America Day.

1354
01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.500
Thank you, and everybody have a great America Day.

1355
01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:28.500
Thank you.

1356
01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:36.500
Senator Lou D'Alessandro places the name of David Scanlon in the nomination for Secretary of State.

1357
01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:38.500
The J.R.

1358
01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:46.000
recognizes a member from Salem, representing Valerie McDonald for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1359
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Thank you, Mr.

1360
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Speaker.

1361
01:53:50.000 --> 01:54:00.500
In front of the esteemed members of both legislative bodies, I second the nomination of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1362
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:06.500
The political process is a daunting undertaking for incumbents and newcomers alike.

1363
01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:16.500
Upon embarking on the term, the support is echoing through this historic chamber and down the halls of the building.

1364
01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:22.500
Hence freshman legislators, such as myself, are greeted with wisdom and advice.

1365
01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:26.000
Among the experienced faces is David Scanlon.

1366
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:37.500
Under Scanlon's leadership, tens of thousands of business entities have utilized the information technology platforms made available by the Secretary of State's office.

1367
01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:46.000
These services continue to improve as ongoing updates increase the ease of conducting business in New Hampshire.

1368
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:54.000
In addition to fueling workplace economies, Scanlon has taken much needed steps to secure voter integrity.

1369
01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:02.500
The previous election cycle presented seemingly insurmountable challenges That as Secretary of State, Scanlon took in stride.

1370
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:10.000
His courageous administration of ballot recounts demonstrated a relentless will to protect the people's vote.

1371
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:19.500
Therefore, we can be more than confident in his ability to greet the upcoming session with grace and expertise.

1372
01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:26.500
As I conclude this speech, I'd like to leave you with a final note.

1373
01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.500
Service.

1374
01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:35.500
The commitment to best serve needs to be honored every day of the session.

1375
01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500
Today is day one.

1376
01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:47.000
Let's choose to be able to tell constituents that this vote, right here, right now, we got it right.

1377
01:55:47.000 --> 01:56:00.000
In upholding my oath of office to best serve my constituents, I cast my vote for David Scanlon, Birdsill, with the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1378
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Thank you, Mr.

1379
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Speaker.

1380
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:09.500
Thank you and congratulations to our esteemed colleagues in the House.

1381
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.500
Mr.

1382
01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:19.000
Speaker, I proudly rise to second the nomination of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1383
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:33.000
As a two-term House member on election law and a member and former chair of Senate Election Law Committee, I've worked closely with Secretary Scanlon and his staff.

1384
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:39.500
Secretary Scanlon is a trusted, nonpartisan resource for our committees and our communities.

1385
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:54.000
His team is one of the best in state government, and their work results in elections that run smoothly and have some of the highest turnouts in the country.

1386
01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.500
When our constituents go to the polls they know their votes will count.

1387
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:14.000
They know they will get the results in a timely fashion and this trust in the system is what keeps our granted staters active in our democracy.

1388
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:28.500
I want to emphasize the role of the Secretary of State has in protecting the first-in-the-nation primary and ensuring our constituents' voices are heard during the presidential nominating process.

1389
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:38.000
The New Hampshire primary was first held in 1916 to select delegates to the Republican and Democratic National Convention.

1390
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:48.000
In 1952, we held the first primary where voters directly voted for presidential candidates and the country witnessed Dwight D.

1391
01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Eisenhower upset Robert Taft.

1392
01:57:50.000 --> 01:58:08.500
Since 1975, state law has mandated New Hampshire's primary be held at least one week prior to any similar contest and our Secretary of State has the authority to move that date to ensure we are first.

1393
01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:22.500
Throughout the years, many states have challenged us and through the leadership of former Secretary Gardner and Secretary Scanlon we have prevailed and held our positions each time.

1394
01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:26.500
They are dedicated to upholding our state law.

1395
01:58:26.500 --> 01:58:35.000
What makes our primary so special is that our electorate takes the job seriously in New Hampshire.

1396
01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:45.500
We don't fall for millions of dollars spent on advertising, the national headlines, or campaigns that operate from a consultant's headquarters.

1397
01:58:45.500 --> 01:58:50.000
Here the candidates actually have to earn our votes.

1398
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:57.500
We expect them to shake our hands, answer our non-scripted questions, and run grassroots campaigns.

1399
01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:05.000
And because of this, New Hampshire is a state where all candidates have a chance.

1400
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:43.000
How many times have we witnessed underdogs come away with better than expected finishes or surprise wins because they put in the sweat equity that our voters expect and I'm sure many of you here have been part of those campaigns and even though political committees DC political operatives and partisan influencers think they can diminish the granite state's voice in the presidential nomination process we have an opportunity here today to protect our first-in-the-nation status.

1401
01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:50.000
We can do this by electing David Scanlon to be our Secretary of State.

1402
01:59:50.000 --> 02:00:01.500
He has the experience and the temperament to protect our primary and ensure New Hampshire has a say in 2024 and hopefully beyond.

1403
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:11.500
With decades of experience, David Scanlon has proven his ability to serve New Hampshire in a professional and nonpartisan fashion.

1404
02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:19.000
I hope you will join me in supporting him for our next Secretary of State.

1405
02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
Thank you, Mr.

1406
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Speaker.

1407
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Thank you, Mr.

1408
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Speaker.

1409
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:34.000
Senator Regina Byrd still seconds the nomination of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1410
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Chair recognizes a member of Peterborough will present Peter Leachman for purposes of seconding the nomination.

1411
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Thank you, Mr.

1412
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Speaker, and congratulations.

1413
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
Mr.

1414
02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:55.500
Speaker, I rise enthusiastically to second the nomination of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1415
02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:10.000
I first met David in 1996 as an incoming member of the Environment and Agriculture Committee and knew David as one of the most nonpartisan members of that committee.

1416
02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:24.500
In my opinion, the Secretary of State is not a position you can just drop into without first, proving yourself able to assume the role of Secretary of State.

1417
02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:37.000
In this regard, David served as deputy for 20 years before assuming the role of Secretary of State after Bill Garner retired earlier this year.

1418
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:52.500
The Secretary of State's office and the Secretary of State himself is in my opinion the most important elected position in New Hampshire due to the important oversight responsibilities, especially elections.

1419
02:01:52.500 --> 02:01:54.500
It is said, Mr.

1420
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:59.000
Speaker, we are judged by the company we keep.

1421
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:22.000
becoming Secretary of State, David has appointed two incredible people that many of us already know, Patty Lovejoy, who served on the Finance Committee with me, a Democrat, and Aaron Hennessy, that many of you know, that served on House Finance and Senate Finance, a Republican.

1422
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:46.000
After David became Deputy Secretary of State, he often appeared before the House Finance Committee to testify for additional funding for election oversight, bringing the Secretary of State's office into the 21st century finally, and the need to make the Secretary of State's website a more positive experience.

1423
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:56.500
Despite legislative constraints, David and his staff of 89 people have modernized all the divisions under the control of his office.

1424
02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:11.500
Whether as deputy or now secretary, David's goals in the Secretary of State's office have always been to streamline the process of voting and to make sure every vote counts.

1425
02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:18.500
Like many of us, I ventured over to the archives to observe the voting.

1426
02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:22.000
I asked David how it was going.

1427
02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:31.000
He said he couldn't be more pleased with the professionalism of his staff, the counters, or the observers.

1428
02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:48.500
And then he said, and it really stuck with me, because those of you who know this will certainly have heard it before, and we are going to stay here until every vote is counted.

1429
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:56.000
For me, David has a proven record of being completely nonpartisan, ethical, competent, and humble.

1430
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:12.500
As Deputy Secretary of State for the last 20 years before he became Secretary of State, he never took one political contribution, made one, attended a political event, or endorsed a political candidate.

1431
02:04:12.500 --> 02:04:15.000
We are so fortunate, Mr.

1432
02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:26.000
Speaker, to have David as our Secretary of State, and I hope you will join me in casting your vote for David.

1433
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1434
02:04:28.500 --> 02:04:30.500
Speaker.

1435
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:37.000
Senator Peter Leishman seconds the nomination of David Scanlon for Secretary of State.

1436
02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:45.000
The chair recognizes Senator from Manchester, Senator Donna Susi, for the purpose of making the nomination.

1437
02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1438
02:04:47.500 --> 02:04:49.500
Speaker, Mr.

1439
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.500
President.

1440
02:04:51.500 --> 02:04:58.000
It's my pleasure to place in nomination the name of Senator Melanie Levesque.

1441
02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:08.500
Senator Melanie Levesque was a colleague of mine and is an advocate and a champion and in many ways a trailblazer.

1442
02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:14.000
And I'm very proud to place her name before you today.

1443
02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Senator Levesque has served both on the House and Senate election law committees, has done tireless work to ensure our elections are run in the most efficient, transparent, and best manner possible.

1444
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:49.000
Senator Levesque chaired the Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee in the Senate where she also advocated for important changes to ensure that every voter has the opportunity to cast their vote in each and every possible election.

1445
02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:53.000
But she's so many more things as well.

1446
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.500
She's a small business owner.

1447
02:05:55.500 --> 02:06:08.500
She's keenly aware of the needs of businesses in our community and how businesses need to be able to interact with the Secretary of State's office.

1448
02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:12.000
Melanie has a plan for the office.

1449
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Melanie has a plan to modernize and to ensure impartiality and transparency.

1450
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:31.500
More specifically, she will provide a template for towns for their websites so that each town website is up to date and accurate with accurate voting information.

1451
02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:40.000
She will expand the use of e-poll books so every community can increase efficiency at polling locations.

1452
02:06:40.000 --> 02:07:02.000
And she will support our local elected officials by utilizing state funding or HAVA funds, the Help America Vote Act funds, to provide grants to help recruit and train poll workers and volunteers, and ensure, once again, transparency, efficiency, and accuracy within the office.

1453
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:29.000
I think many of these changes are needed, and unfortunately, my confidence has been shaken a bit recently by some of the actions of the office, including a high-ranking employee publicly endorsing a candidate, and even following a second recount, mailing a certificate of election postmarked after the second recount to the unsuccessful candidate.

1454
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:37.500
I hate to have to express those concerns, but I think they're important in our considerations today.

1455
02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:44.500
I've worked with Melanie, as I know many of you have, over many years.

1456
02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:49.500
I believe Melanie will be an excellent Secretary of State.

1457
02:07:49.500 --> 02:07:52.000
She's a person of integrity.

1458
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:59.000
She's a person willing to roll up her sleeves and do the hard work.

1459
02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.500
She's a person willing to negotiate and to compromise.

1460
02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:11.500
And she's a person who I believe will serve our state very well in this capacity.

1461
02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:13.500
For those reasons, Mr.

1462
02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.500
Speaker, Mr.

1463
02:08:15.500 --> 02:08:23.500
President, I'm proud to place the name of Melanie Levesque in nomination for Secretary of State.

1464
02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:25.500
Thank you.

1465
02:08:25.500 --> 02:08:30.500
Senator Donna Soucy nominates Melanie Levesque for Secretary of State.

1466
02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:38.500
Chair recognizes a member from Nashmore, Representative Michael O'Brien, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1467
02:08:38.500 --> 02:08:40.500
Thank you, Mr.

1468
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:43.000
Speaker, and congratulations to you.

1469
02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.500
Good afternoon, representatives and senators.

1470
02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:59.000
I am excited to be up here in front of you seconding the nomination of the gentlewoman from Brookline, the Honorable Melanie Levesque for Secretary of State.

1471
02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Now, I have gotten to know Melanie during her time as state representative and as a senator representing several of our wards as part of the great city of Nashua.

1472
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:24.000
It was clear to me personally and to others, the voters, that Melanie puts the needs of her constituents first.

1473
02:09:24.000 --> 02:10:13.500
She proved herself to be a serious and thorough person capable of working with anyone who wanted to progress the safety and security of our, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, and the administration of the Secretary of State, a deserving trend of the Secretary of supporting anti-voting policies.

1474
02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:24.500
Starting in 2014, with the support of a requiring 30 days residency when voting, a bill that the ACLU argued was unconstitutional.

1475
02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:38.500
To his support of Senate Bill 3, which multiple courts said was unconstitutional and in the process of wasting $4 million in taxpayers' funds to defend the bill.

1476
02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:49.000
And just last year when he supported Senate Bill 418, he himself said it would be unconstitutional, but still supported it.

1477
02:10:49.000 --> 02:11:00.000
In the case of Senate Bill 418, the secretary broke with his predecessor in supporting a provisional ballot system in New Hampshire.

1478
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:40.000
After advocating for the bill and the right before the governor to sign it, in part with the secretary's advice, one on record is saying he hadn't noticed a section that would disenfranchise overseas active military voters Our voters deserve particularly better than that Including our military who are serving us overseas and out of state We have something that's near and dear to me in my job though People know me as on the Board of Alderman in Nashville.

1479
02:11:40.000 --> 02:12:19.500
We have infrastructure And I'm going to say, We have Something that's near and dear to me in my job though that people know me as on the board of Alderman in Nashville We have infrastructure and When infrastructure breaks down Its things don't work and that includes our ballot counting devices here in the state They were last manufactured in 2008 and in 2019 the company that makes these machines won they would not last very much longer.

1480
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:26.000
Anyone familiar with these machine knows they are now prone to break infrequently.

1481
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:38.500
These machines are running out of time and even though the warnings came over three years ago the office has failed to act until now.

1482
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:53.500
This failure to act means that we now must scramble to find the right machine and hope our machines hold up long enough for the new ones to be approved.

1483
02:12:53.500 --> 02:13:32.500
I am confident that under the tutelage of Melanie Levesque, that the Secretary of State Office will look forward to see the problems be addressed and address them proactively and I am confident she will support legislation That will make our elections more accessible and more secure to all residents of the state of New Hampshire So I urge you to support with me as I second the nomination of the gentlewomen from Brookline, the Honorable Melanie Levesque.

1484
02:13:32.500 --> 02:13:34.500
Thank you, Mr.

1485
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:36.500
Speaker.

1486
02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:43.000
Representative Michael O'Brien seconds the nomination of Melanie Levesque for Secretary of State.

1487
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:51.500
Chair recognizes the member from Concord, Representative Mary Jane Walnut for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1488
02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:53.500
Thank you, Mr.

1489
02:13:53.500 --> 02:13:55.500
Speaker, and congratulations.

1490
02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:58.000
Representatives and senators, good afternoon.

1491
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Today I have the honor and the pleasure of seconding the nomination for Honorable Melanie Levesque for Secretary of State.

1492
02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:14.500
I first met Melanie in 2006 when she was elected to this body.

1493
02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:24.000
In the House, I know her as an effective, passionate advocate for equality who was always well-prepared and well-informed.

1494
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Unfortunately, as happens all too often with our strong House members, after three terms, Melanie sought the extra elbow room across the wall and ran for the Senate.

1495
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:53.500
In 2019, Melanie was the chair of the election law in the Senate, election law committee in the Senate, and I was the chair of the Finance Committee in the House.

1496
02:14:53.500 --> 02:15:11.000
The The Secure Modern Accurate Registration technology, also known as the SMART Act, which had a fiscal impact, had passed the Senate and the House Election Law Committee and was referred to the Finance Committee.

1497
02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:26.500
Melanie came to the Finance Committee prepared to talk about how the SMART Act would benefit granite staters in prepared to talk about how the SMART Act would benefit granite staters.

1498
02:15:26.500 --> 02:15:42.500
In order to make sure she had all the details correct, she went to different Secretaries of States throughout New England and talked with them all about their automated voter registration systems.

1499
02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:52.500
An important piece of these trips, and Melanie did not take these trips alone, she brought with her the stakeholders.

1500
02:15:52.500 --> 02:16:11.500
Together, local elected officials, representatives, and senators, and members of the Secretary of State's office, including then Deputy Secretary of State Scallon, so everyone who was part of the process understood the benefits and how it moved forward.

1501
02:16:11.500 --> 02:16:27.500
Melanie isn't running to keep the status quo, and it is important to know as she moves the office forward, she will not do it alone, but with everyone's voice being heard.

1502
02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:33.000
Some members sitting here today wonder why New Hampshire needs change.

1503
02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
I think most of us in this room would agree.

1504
02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:45.000
New Hampshire runs safe, secure elections and we routinely have very high voter turnout.

1505
02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:48.500
However, being stagnant is not an option.

1506
02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:54.500
We cannot miss out on the benefits of new ideas and infrastructure.

1507
02:16:54.500 --> 02:17:11.500
Melanie will modernize the Secretary of State's office by bringing needed transparency to the office's budget and by using technology to update the way we submit campaign finance reforms, lobbyist reports, and business filings.

1508
02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:18.000
We can also trust Melanie to protect the first in the nation primary.

1509
02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:26.500
Make no mistake, we have gone first for 100 years, and we will continue to go first.

1510
02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:36.000
Melanie will spend the upcoming months defending the primary and ensuring we continue to be first in the nation.

1511
02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:46.500
Melanie Levesque has all the tools necessary to run the Secretary of State's office and move it into the 21st century.

1512
02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:57.500
I am thrilled to second Melanie Levesque for a Secretary of State and hope you will join me in voting for her.

1513
02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:03.500
Representative Walner seconds the nomination of Melanie Levesque for Secretary of State.

1514
02:18:03.500 --> 02:18:11.000
Chair recognizes Senator for Portsmouth, Senator Rebecca Perkins-Kowocca for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1515
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
Thank you, Mr.

1516
02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
Speaker and Mr.

1517
02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:17.000
President.

1518
02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
And congratulations.

1519
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:22.500
for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1520
02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:24.500
Thank you, Mr.

1521
02:18:24.500 --> 02:18:26.500
Speaker and Mr.

1522
02:18:26.500 --> 02:18:32.000
President, and congratulations to all of you here in the chamber.

1523
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I rise to respectfully second the nomination of the Honorable Melanie LeVake for Secretary of State.

1524
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:48.500
Melanie LeVake is a small business owner and former legislator serving in both the House and Senate.

1525
02:18:48.500 --> 02:19:04.500
She was chair of the Senate Election Law Committee and has been a long-time champion for voting rights, a voice for making our elections function efficiently and securely and fairly for all.

1526
02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:12.500
She decided to run for Secretary of State to bring this expertise to all Granite Staters.

1527
02:19:12.500 --> 02:19:19.000
We take pride in our first-in nation primary, and Melanie is no exception.

1528
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:41.000
Our honorable colleague is also running to be a Secretary of State who will implement the modernization reforms which will expand voting rights in the office, making our elections more secure and streamlining our corporate processes for New Hampshire small businesses and their workers.

1529
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:56.500
As a corporate attorney and voting right advocate, I have seen the differences between New Hampshire and other states, and it serves us all to keep this modernization effort moving forward.

1530
02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:02.000
Change and innovation, while hard, is a vital part of government.

1531
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:16.500
As a former Portsmouth City Councilor, I know firsthand the impacts that decisions here in Concord can have on our elections and on local election officials in our communities.

1532
02:20:16.500 --> 02:20:35.000
As a senator, I've had the pleasure to serve on the Election Law and Municipal Affairs Committee and during this time, I've worked with Secretary Scanlon and have been able to form a personal connection with him.

1533
02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:49.000
But I also see from these positions I have been so fortunate to hold that we cannot continue to do things the way we have always done them.

1534
02:20:49.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Now at this moment in our democracy, we must be clear-eyed about building a deep confidence in our elections, which requires keeping a constant eye on the modernization that today's world requires.

1535
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Things like making sure we will have a voting machine that works for our 2024 election.

1536
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:18.000
Right now, our 2008 technology may be obsolete by then.

1537
02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:34.500
Joining a multi-state database named ERIC, which 31 states, including governors from both sides of the aisle, have joined and which gives our local officials additional information to keep our voting rolls accurate.

1538
02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:41.500
Providing for safe and secure online voter registration to make our residents' lives easier.

1539
02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:55.000
And hopefully avoiding the confusing experience of recounts being reopened, though we all agree the winner sits here today in our chamber with all the ballots counted.

1540
02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Change is now within our grasp.

1541
02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:18.500
Melanie has promised the reform of the that the office needs, a commitment to modernizing election results not in PDF, campaign finance reports that are easier to submit and access, and modernizing our elections to make them more accessible and secure.

1542
02:22:18.500 --> 02:22:26.500
Even making sure that accurate polling locations are always available to our voters on the website.

1543
02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:34.000
New Hampshire deserves and needs a Secretary of State who will move New Hampshire forward.

1544
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:46.000
It is why I am proud today to second the nomination of Melanie Levick, and I hope you will join in voting for her.

1545
02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:51.500
Senator Rebecca Perkins-Colker seconds the nomination for the Secretary of State.

1546
02:22:51.500 --> 02:22:54.000
Are there any further nominations?

1547
02:22:54.000 --> 02:23:00.500
There being none, the chair declares nominations for the Secretary of State closed.

1548
02:23:00.500 --> 02:23:14.500
Will the Sergeant of Arms make sure all the members are in the chamber so that the clerk may read the balancing procedure.響鐘 The chair recognizes the clerk.

1549
02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:16.500
Thank you, Mr.

1550
02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:18.500
Speaker.

1551
02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:30.000
Balloting will be done by division, and the Senate members will cast their ballots in the A through E box to my right.

1552
02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:34.500
The ballots will be handed out by my staff.

1553
02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:39.000
When you have marked your ballot, please remain seated.

1554
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:42.000
Each division will be called individually.

1555
02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:46.000
As a reminder, there are four ballot boxes.

1556
02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:52.500
Number one, A through E is on your left near the chamber door.

1557
02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:59.500
Number two, F through L is in the back left near the rear door.

1558
02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:02.000
Number three is back there.

1559
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:05.500
To your right is M through P.

1560
02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:10.000
And number four up here is Q through Z.

1561
02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Thank you.

1562
02:24:12.000 --> 02:25:00.500
near the rear door number three is back there to your right is m through p and number four up here is q through z it is important that you use the correct ballot box staff members from the house clerk's office and the republican and democratic offices are stationed at each box before you deposit your ballot in the box please clearly state your name so the staff person can check the list for For ease of traffic flow in the front and the back, please do not leave your seat until your division is called.

1563
02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:09.000
Then please return to your seat via an aisle as quickly as possible away from the division.

1564
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:17.000
So the recommendation is if you exit to the right and come back to the left.

1565
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:24.500
The tellers that will be counting the ballots after the ballots have closed for Ms.

1566
02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:26.500
Levesque I'm sorry.

1567
02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:29.500
and come back to the left.

1568
02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:37.000
The tellers that will be counting the ballots after the ballots have closed for Ms.

1569
02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Levesque are Representatives Lane and Bolden.

1570
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
For Mr.

1571
02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:45.500
Scanlon are Representatives Doucette and Senator Pearl.

1572
02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:54.000
And the chair on behalf of the House appoints Representatives Hunt and Schuett as the remaining tellers.

1573
02:25:54.000 --> 02:26:03.500
At this time, the Senate is invited, excuse me, the ballots for the Senate, because he's got that box.

1574
02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:05.500
He's got the ballots.

1575
02:26:05.500 --> 02:26:07.500
Okay.

1576
02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:09.500

I'm going to go over the course.

1615
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I've been here.

1616
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I've been here.

1617
02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I've been here.

1618
02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I've been here.

1619
02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
It's crazy.

1620
02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
It's a wild time.

1621
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
Christmas time.

1622
02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.500
I've got one with Howard.

1623
02:28:19.500 --> 02:28:21.500
You and Howard excited.

1624
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:23.500
Yeah.

1625
02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:26.500
Do we get a little stiffer?

1626
02:28:26.500 --> 02:28:28.500
That would be funny.

1627

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Double check.

1815
02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
Double check.

1816
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
Double check.

1817
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Double check.

1818
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Double check.

1819
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Double check.

1820
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
Double check.

1821
02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
Thank you.

1822
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
Oh, God, maybe not.

1823
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
No, maybe not.

1824
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
Oh, my God.

1825
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Oh, okay, sorry.

1826
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:41.000
No, just do what you do.

1827
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
Okay.

1828
02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Thank you.

1829
02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
Aye.

1830
02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Yes, that everything that you did.

1831
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
Yes, and I agree.

1832
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Thank you.

1833
02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
I said something.

1834
02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
What?

1835
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Oh, please.

1836
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.000
I've seen it in the ground.

1837
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
No, I think.

1838
02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
No, I think.

1839
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.500
I think she was ready.

1840
02:38:09.500 --> 02:38:11.500
I'm not sure.

1841
02:38:11.500 --> 02:38:13.500
I'm not sure.

1842
02:38:13.500 --> 02:38:15.500
I'm not sure.

1843
02:38:15.500 --> 02:38:17.500
I'm not.

1844
02:38:17.500 --> 02:38:19.500
I'm not sure.

1845
02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:21.500
I'm not sure.

1846
02:38:21.500 --> 02:38:23.500
I'm not sure.

1847
02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:25.500
I'm not sure.

1848
02:38:25.500 --> 02:38:27.500
I'm not sure.

1849
02:38:27.500 --> 02:38:29.500
I'm not sure.

1850
02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:31.500
I'm not sure.

1851
02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:33.500
I'm not sure.

1852
02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:35.500
I'm not sure.

1853
02:38:35.500 --> 02:38:37.500
I'm not sure.

1854
02:38:37.500 --> 02:38:39.500
I'm not sure.

1855
02:38:39.500 --> 02:38:41.500
I'm not sure.

1856
02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:43.500
I'm not sure.

1857
02:38:43.500 --> 02:38:45.500
I'm not sure.

1858
02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:47.500
I'm not sure.

1859
02:38:47.500 --> 02:38:49.500
I'm not sure.

1860
02:38:49.500 --> 02:38:51.500
I'm not sure.

1861
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.500
Thank you.

1862
02:38:53.500 --> 02:38:55.500
Oh, I know.

1863
02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:00.500
I mean, you know I mean, it's really not good.

1864
02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:02.500
Yeah.

1865
02:39:02.500 --> 02:39:04.500
Okay, let me see.

1866
02:39:04.500 --> 02:39:09.500
I mean, my example, for you guys, this is 10.

1867
02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:11.500
I can't believe it.

1868
02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:13.500
I can't believe it.

1869
02:39:13.500 --> 02:39:15.500
I can't believe it.

1870
02:39:15.500 --> 02:39:17.500
I can't believe it.

1871
02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:19.500
I can't believe it.

1872
02:39:19.500 --> 02:39:21.500
I can't believe it.

1873
02:39:21.500 --> 02:39:23.500
I can't believe it.

1874
02:39:23.500 --> 02:39:25.500
I can't believe it.

1875
02:39:25.500 --> 02:39:27.500
I can't believe it.

1876
02:39:27.500 --> 02:39:29.500
It's good.

1877
02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:31.500
No, it's good.

1878
02:39:31.500 --> 02:39:33.500
No, it's good.

1879
02:39:33.500 --> 02:39:35.500
Yeah, it's good.

1880
02:39:35.500 --> 02:39:37.500
No, it's good.

1881
02:39:37.500 --> 02:39:39.500
Yeah, it's good.

1882
02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:41.500
Thank you.

1883
02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:43.500
So beautiful.

1884
02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:45.500
Thank you.

1885
02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:47.500
Gracias.

1886
02:39:47.500 --> 02:39:49.500
Thank you.

1887
02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:51.500
Gracias.

1888
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:53.500
Gracias.

1889
02:39:53.500 --> 02:39:55.500
Thank you.

1890
02:39:55.500 --> 02:39:57.500
Thank you.

1891
02:39:57.500 --> 02:39:59.500
Members take your seats.

1892
02:39:59.500 --> 02:40:02.500
The hulls will come to water.

1893
02:40:02.500 --> 02:40:04.500
Thank you.

1894
02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:06.500
Thank you.

1895
02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:08.500
Thank you.

1896
02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:10.500
Thank you.

1897
02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:12.500
Thank you.

1898
02:40:12.500 --> 02:40:14.500
Members, take your seats.

1899
02:40:14.500 --> 02:40:16.500
House come to water.

1900
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:21.000
There were 413 ballots cast, 207 needed for election.

1901
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:26.500
Zero blank ballots, one write-in, 175 for Levesque, 237 for Scanlon.

1902
02:40:26.500 --> 02:40:28.500
Gracias.

1903
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:32.500
Nominations for state treasurer are now in order.

1904
02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:40.500
The chair recognizes Senator from Manchester, Senator Lou D'Alessandro for the purpose of making a nomination.

1905
02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.500
Thank you Mr.

1906
02:40:42.500 --> 02:40:44.500
Speaker.

1907
02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:47.500
This is two in a row.

1908
02:40:47.500 --> 02:41:00.500
This is the first time in my life that I was able, I am going to be able to nominate a person with an Italo-American name.

1909
02:41:00.500 --> 02:41:02.500
Come on!

1910
02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:04.500
Let's hear it!

1911
02:41:04.500 --> 02:41:11.000
Monica Zempelli, as my grandmother would say, not Italian, but a nicer girl.

1912
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Okay?

1913
02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:18.500
And that's what she said about my wife, and it's lasted.

1914
02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:25.000
I'm pleased to nominate Monica Zempeli to be the New Hampshire State Treasurer.

1915
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:31.000
Monica's a graduate of LaSalle University, and she's a certified public accountant.

1916
02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:42.500
Prior to her election as state treasurer in 2020, Monica served as deputy state treasurer for six years and has just been outstanding.

1917
02:41:42.500 --> 02:41:52.500
It was during this time that I worked with Monica on the New Hampshire College Tuition Savings Plan Advisory Committee.

1918
02:41:52.500 --> 02:42:06.000
I've also worked with her during both the operating and capital budget process, where she's been an invaluable resource to the legislature, sharing her knowledge and expertise.

1919
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:25.500
This is a job that is truly, truly not recognized, not given enough credit by the legislature itself because she decides what is our capacity for bonding, what's the capacity for the capital budget, and gives us these numbers.

1920
02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:27.500
She manages our money.

1921
02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:32.500
At one time, we had $2 billion in the bank.

1922
02:42:32.500 --> 02:42:34.500
$2 billion.

1923
02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:45.000
And that money could gain interest because of the new federal law, and she did a marvelous job of handling that.

1924
02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.500
So I believe she's the only nominee.

1925
02:42:48.500 --> 02:43:02.000
I hope that you will give her a great Christmas present in terms of your vote and carry forward and elect Monica Mezapelli as your state treasurer.

1926
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Thanks so much and have a great day.

1927
02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:10.500
Senator Lou D'Alessandro nominates Monica Mezapelli for state treasurer.

1928
02:43:10.500 --> 02:43:18.500
Chair recognizes the representative from Kingston, Representative Ken Wyler, for the purpose of seconding the nomination.

1929
02:43:18.500 --> 02:43:20.500
Thank you, Mr.

1930
02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:22.500
Speaker, Mr.

1931
02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:24.500
President.

1932
02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:33.000
I rise to second the nomination of Monica Mezopelli for Treasurer of the State of New Hampshire.

1933
02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:37.500
I've known and worked with Monica for five years.

1934
02:43:37.500 --> 02:43:43.500
I'm also a member of the College Tuition Savings Plan Advisory Commission.

1935
02:43:43.500 --> 02:43:47.500
The State Treasurer has an important role there.

1936
02:43:47.500 --> 02:44:03.500
And she was the one even before she was the full Treasurer that was the most informed and had the best grasp of detail about what we were doing on that committee.

1937
02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:09.500
Treasurer's role in state government is far more complex than many realize.

1938
02:44:09.500 --> 02:44:17.000
As was said, the treasurer is responsible for all the borrowing to fund the government.

1939
02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:25.000
That involves collaborating with the bond council and other financial experts to get a credit rating.

1940
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:37.500
In order to put the best light on our state to get the best interest, she creates a document called the New Hampshire information statement.

1941
02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:48.000
It's a great read if you want to know about the economics and the government of the state of New Hampshire.

1942
02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:58.000
And that's what goes to make the credit rating, can save us millions if you get a good credit rating.

1943
02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:02.000
So we've had a great candidate for treasurer.

1944
02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:07.500
She's been 20 years in state government, always dealing with finances.

1945
02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:24.000
She's been doing this job either as the number one or the number two person for the last eight years Please vote for Monica Mezapelli as treasurer for the state of New Hampshire.

1946
02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.500
Thank you Are there any further nominations?

1947
02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:42.000
There being none I declare nominations closed and direct the clerk to cast one ballot for Monica Mezapeli and declare her duly elected state treasurer for the 23-24 biennium.

1948
02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:45.500
The chair recognizes his secretary of state.

1949
02:45:45.500 --> 02:45:47.500
Thank you.

1950
02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:49.500
Thank you.

1951
02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:51.500
Thank you.

1952
02:45:51.500 --> 02:45:53.500
Thank you.

1953
02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:55.500
Mr.

1954
02:45:55.500 --> 02:45:57.500
Speaker, Mr.

1955
02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:01.500
President, members of the Senate and the House.

1956
02:46:01.500 --> 02:46:04.500
Thank you for this tremendous honor.

1957
02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:09.500
And thank you for what was clearly a bipartisan vote.

1958
02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:12.500
That was really important to me.

1959
02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:15.000
And I greatly appreciate it.

1960
02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:27.500
I would certainly like to thank Senator D'Alessandro, Representative McConnell, Senator Burtzel, and Representative Leishman for the great speeches that you gave for me today.

1961
02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:30.000
I really, really appreciate that.

1962
02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:51.500
And I would really like to thank my staff, who have worked really hard with me over the last 10 months to move the office forward and do some really great things that we all plan to continue for the next two years.

1963
02:46:51.500 --> 02:47:02.500
We've set a great foundation, and you're going to see some great stuff coming out of the office in the short term.

1964
02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:06.500
My deputies, Aaron and Patty, have been great.

1965
02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:18.000
And then the tremendous staff in the Secretary of State's office generally all work really, really hard, harder than any other state agency.

1966
02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.000
And I'm really, really, really proud of them.

1967
02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:37.500
And before I conclude my remarks, I think, you know, I do have to recognize Bill Gardner, who for the first time in 46 years is not standing at this podium.

1968
02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:48.500
He's left a tremendous legacy for the state of New Hampshire and our state is much better off because of his service.

1969
02:47:48.500 --> 02:47:50.500
Thank you very much.

1970
02:47:50.500 --> 02:47:54.000
The chair recognizes State Treasurer Monica Mesapelli.

1971
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
Good afternoon, Mr.

1972
02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
Speaker, Mr.

1973
02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:02.000
Senate President, honorable member of this general court.

1974
02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.000
Congratulations to all of you today.

1975
02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:13.000
Thank you very much for your support and for your electing me as your state treasurer.

1976
02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:25.000
I would like to express my gratitude first to Senator D'Alessandro and Representative Weiler for nominating me today and for the very kind words.

1977
02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:33.500
It is a true honor to have served as your state treasurer over the last two years.

1978
02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:49.500
Today I'm very grateful that I get to do it again, to continue the work, to serve in this capacity, and to serve all of you and the citizens of this state.

1979
02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:58.500
Protecting our public funds, our taxpayer dollars, is not only my job, it really is my top priority.

1980
02:48:58.500 --> 02:49:05.000
I'm very honored to be here in this chamber for the first time.

1981
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:17.500
Two years ago when you first elected me as your treasurer, we were at UNH and it was a time of many unknowns and uncertainties.

02:52:45.500 --> 02:52:49.000

2017
02:52:56.500 --> 02:52:58.500
Mr.

2018
02:52:58.500 --> 02:53:09.500
Speaker, House Resolution 6, calling for a special runoff election for representative to the general court between Chuck Grassi and David Walker.

2019
02:53:09.500 --> 02:53:53.500
whereas the general election in Stratford County District 8 has ultimately resulted in a tie between Chuck Grassi and David Walker and whereas this House has both the constitutional authority to settle this matter by voting to seat one of these candidates and a tradition of endorsing the concept of the election settling a tie, and whereas the House believes that the voters of that district have already indicated by their close vote that they wish to be represented in the general court by one of these individuals.

2020
02:53:53.500 --> 02:55:05.500
Now therefore be it resolved by the House of Representatives that this seat be declared vacant and the election be returned to the voters of Stratford County District 8 as legally constituted as of November 8th, 2022 to uphold the principle of one person, one vote, and that if the City of Rochester chooses to hold a special election to determine their choice for representatives to the General Court, the House of Representatives orders that the ballots used in that runoff election contain only the names of Chuck Grassi and David Walker with no blank appearing, and that the Clerk of the House transmit a copy of this resolution to the Secretary of State, Chuck Grassi and David Walker, and that all communications to the Clerk of the House from the parties at interest in this matter be entered in the house journal mr.

2021
02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:23.000
speaker for what reason does the member rise I rise to make a motion I would like to table house resolution six that motion is in order A division will be done by standing votes.

2022
02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:27.000
A division will be done by standing votes.

2023
02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Members, take your seats.

2024
02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:33.000
This will be a division vote by standing.

2025
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:36.500
Representative Wilhelm has requested a roll call.

2026
02:55:36.500 --> 02:55:38.500

2027
02:55:38.500 --> 02:55:40.500
It is sufficiently seconded.

2028
02:55:40.500 --> 02:55:44.000

Members will take their seats.

2030
02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:54.000
Members should understand that once the roll call starts, this is a verbal roll call.

2031
02:55:54.000 --> 02:56:01.000
Members must remain in their seats for the entirety of a roll call vote.

2032

Sorry, Mr.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.000
Speaker, I was out of courtesy.

2038
02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:22.500
I wanted to see if we were going to do this or not.

2039
02:56:22.500 --> 02:56:28.000
Our fellow members, we all knew this vote was coming today.

2040
02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:31.500
If I know, excuse me, I apologize.

2041
02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:35.500
If I know, I'm new to this, right?

2042
02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:46.500

2043
02:56:46.500 --> 02:57:07.000
Speaker, that this debate that we can have can wait until the next time we meet, and it not change anything would I now vote yes on the tabling motion chair recognize the representative Wilhelm for parliamentary inquiry thank you mr.

2044
02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
speaker mr.

2045
02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:20.000
speaker if I know this body has a long-standing precedent of respecting the will of the voters in settling tied house races.

2046
02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:48.500
If I do not live in Rochester Ward 4 and believe it is up to the people of Rochester Ward 4, not us, to determine who represents them, if I want to begin this term in the bipartisan environment that we have all spoke so highly of today, would I now vote no on the tabling motion.

2047
02:57:48.500 --> 02:57:54.500
The motion before us is a tabling motion on House Resolution 6.

2048
02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:57.500

2049
02:57:57.500 --> 02:58:00.000

I also come to order.

2601
03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:54.000
The vote was 187 yeas, 193 nays.

2602
03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000
The motion fails.

2603
03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.500
House will be in order.

2604
03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:00.500
Chair recognizes Representative Wilhelm.

2605
03:18:00.500 --> 03:18:02.500
Thank you, Mr.

2606
03:18:02.500 --> 03:18:04.500
Speaker.

2607
03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:28.000
I had not planned to speak to this resolution today, but given some recent conversation about taking a different course of action, I feel like it's really important to explain why this resolution has been introduced and why it's imperative that this House votes to adopt it.

2608
03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:42.000
The New Hampshire Constitution affords the full House the power to seat its members, and when House races end in a tie, our collective power is called upon.

2609
03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:55.500
It does not happen often, but tied elections do occur in House races, and the House has a long-established precedent that respects the will of the voters.

2610
03:18:55.500 --> 03:18:57.500
This resolution, H.R.

2611
03:18:57.500 --> 03:19:10.500
6, continues that tradition of respecting the wishes of voters by returning the results to Rochester Ward 4 to decide that seat through a runoff election.

2612
03:19:10.500 --> 03:19:24.500
In 2014, the House clerk at the time produced a memo for the Democratic and Republican leaders explaining how the House had handled tied elections in the past.

2613
03:19:24.500 --> 03:19:35.000
In every instance, the House had either chosen to call a special election or split the vote between the two members.

2614
03:19:35.000 --> 03:19:44.500
In no instance has the House voted to simply seat one of the two members against the district's wishes.

2615
03:19:44.500 --> 03:19:57.500
As the clerk wrote in 2014, the House has been unwilling to intrude upon the wishes of the voters in any particular instance such as this.

2616
03:19:57.500 --> 03:20:06.000
The resolution before us is the only appropriate way to handle the election in Rochester Ward 4.

2617
03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:22.000
Any attempt by us to determine Rochester's representation without further input from Rochester's voters would be an unprecedented intrusion into voters' wishes and a horrible look for the fairness of this body.

2618
03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:27.500
Please join me in voting yes to adopt House Resolution 6.

2619
03:20:27.500 --> 03:20:29.500
Thank you, Mr.

2620
03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.500
Speaker.

2621
03:20:31.500 --> 03:20:33.500
Chair recognizes Representative Osborne.

2622
03:20:33.500 --> 03:20:35.500

2623
03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:37.500
Speaker.

2624
03:20:37.500 --> 03:20:40.500
I apologize for the confusion here.

2625
03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:49.500
This is our first day back, and we've got a lot of kinks to work out and stuff.

2626
03:20:49.500 --> 03:21:06.500
So this was intended to be a joint motion, and I would encourage all of you to vote in favor of it, and hopefully we can just do a voice vote and be done.

2627
03:21:06.500 --> 03:21:10.500
And this is the right thing to do.

2628
03:21:10.500 --> 03:21:12.500
Thank you very much.

2629
03:21:12.500 --> 03:21:18.000

The staff will clear out as quickly as possible, but you all should exit orderly, please.

2722
03:29:45.500 --> 03:29:48.000
A couple of other things.

2723
03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:50.000
Mileage.

2724
03:29:50.000 --> 03:29:58.000
If you have not signed in for mileage for today, please do sign in for mileage.

2725
03:29:58.000 --> 03:30:02.000
You can do that in the ante room.

2726
03:30:02.000 --> 03:30:37.000
You can do that up in the Speaker's office or across the street in the legislative office building behind that wall are your mailboxes they are arranged this way not this way that being said your patents of office are in your mailboxes if you have not already received them we encourage you to pick them up please do not leave any trash in the chamber following this session today.

2727
03:30:37.000 --> 03:30:43.000
If you left tissues in your slots, please take them with you.

2728
03:30:43.000 --> 03:30:49.500
Do not leave them here for when we are back in a month.

2729
03:30:49.500 --> 03:30:57.500
Speaking of being back in a month, we are going to meet on Wednesday, January 4th.

2730
03:30:57.500 --> 03:31:01.000
That is a constitutionally mandated convening day.

2731
03:31:01.000 --> 03:31:40.500
We will take up any amendments to House rules and introduce most pieces of legislation the following day not tomorrow the following day is the governor's inaugural if it is a joint session of the general court but no votes will be taken so if you do not wish to be present and would like to give up your seat because we have a lot of seats to give away, please do let me know as soon as possible.

2732
03:31:40.500 --> 03:31:42.500
Thank you.

2733
03:31:42.500 --> 03:31:45.500
May I ask you a question?

2734
03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:47.500
Thank you, Mr.

2735
03:31:47.500 --> 03:31:49.500
Speaker.

2736
03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:57.000
So the question of the clerk, the name tags in the mailboxes are not affixed.

2737
03:31:57.000 --> 03:32:00.500
They are only sitting in the holders.

2738
03:32:00.500 --> 03:32:08.000
And so a number of them have blown out or gotten knocked out by people.

2739
03:32:08.000 --> 03:32:20.500
And so when will you have them permanently attached so we can actually find our mailboxes, which I and others were unable to do today?

2740
03:32:20.500 --> 03:32:24.000
It will be taken care of, Representative.

2741
03:32:24.000 --> 03:32:26.000
Thank you.

2742
03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:28.000
Thank you very much.

2743
03:32:28.000 --> 03:32:31.500
The House will attend to unanimous consent.

2744
03:32:31.500 --> 03:32:33.500
Representative Terleski.

2745
03:32:33.500 --> 03:32:45.500
If the members from Nashua who served with the Honorable Skip Cleaver, if they'd like to come up and join me for a minute.

2746
03:32:45.500 --> 03:32:47.500
Thank you.

2747
03:32:47.500 --> 03:32:52.000
with the Honorable Skip Cleaver if they'd on Thursday.

2748
03:32:52.000 --> 03:32:57.000
Thornton Cleaver was born in Pennsylvania in September of 1944.

2749
03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:10.000
His father, a Navy man, referred to his new baby as our little skipper, and for 78 years, he was Skip to all that knew him.

2750
03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:19.500
Skip grew up in Pennsylvania and attended the University of Maryland on a football scholarship where he also wrestled.

2751
03:33:19.500 --> 03:33:30.000
Before finishing his studies at Maryland, he joined the United States Marine Corps where he proudly served from 1965 to 1971.

2752
03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:42.000
After his service, he completed his education at Riviere College with a degree in political science and history and a master's degree in business.

2753
03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:51.000
Skip worked as an air traffic controller with the FAA for many years before joining the Nashua Corporation.

2754
03:33:51.000 --> 03:34:14.000
Over the course of his working life he taught high school and special education, was an adjunct professor at Southern New Hampshire University and Franklin Pierce, wrote a weekly column about running in the Nashua Telegraph and was the managing editor of an online running magazine.

2755
03:34:14.000 --> 03:34:25.000
When he retired in 2016, he ran for this New Hampshire house to represent Nashua's Ward 8, and he served three terms.

2756
03:34:25.000 --> 03:34:44.000
While a quiet and gentle person, Skip was a fierce advocate for social and economic justice and stood firmly for what he believed to be right, even if it was unpopular with others or not considered politically savvy.

2757
03:34:44.000 --> 03:35:03.500
As a member of House Transportation, he advocated for public safety, filing bills that would require the use of seatbelts and the wearing of helmets, and he co-sponsored a bill that prohibited smoking in vehicles when children were present.

2758
03:35:03.500 --> 03:35:15.000
Skip did not mind being unpopular, and he filed these very difficult bills because he believed it was the right thing to do.

2759
03:35:15.000 --> 03:35:49.000
More than once in committee, we would all come to a consensus or an agreement on an issue, and Skip would surprise all of us, being the lone vote in the minority, because he was never afraid to stand alone on an issue and Skip would surprise all of us being the lone vote in the minority because he was never afraid to stand alone on an issue.

2760
03:35:49.000 --> 03:36:04.500
Skip also served locally on the City of Nashua Board of Aldermen representing Ward 8 from 2019 to 2021, helping get our city through the challenging early years of the pandemic.

2761
03:36:04.500 --> 03:36:15.500
He was active and engaged with the Nashua Democratic City Committee and was a unifying leader when we needed him the most.

2762
03:36:15.500 --> 03:36:33.000
Under his leadership as chair of the committee, Democrats swept the 2017 municipal election as well as the 2018 state election, winning all 27 state rep seats, two Senate seats, and the Executive Council seat.

2763
03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:44.000
My last conversation with him was the day after the election when he called to celebrate the 27 state rep seats again.

2764
03:36:44.000 --> 03:37:06.500
Many of us knew him as a slight man who moved carefully and deliberately in the last few years, but Skip was an athlete his entire life, and running was his true love, not only for the activity itself, but for the community it created.

2765
03:37:06.500 --> 03:37:11.000
He was a long-distance runner and completed 43 marathons.

2766
03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:20.500
Racing into his 70s, he successfully completed 134 mountain races, including 27 straight up Mount Washington to the summit.

2767
03:37:20.500 --> 03:37:37.000
He brought his love of running to the community and was a charter member of the Gate City Striders Running Club, serving as its president and eventually inducted into their Hall of Fame.

2768
03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:54.000
Organizing and volunteering for charity races, as well as bringing couch to 5K programs to the Nashua area, Skip took his love of running and used his connections in the community to help others.

2769
03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.000
He enjoyed a cold beer and he loved ice cream.

2770
03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:07.500
In March of 2020, Skip asked me to join him to get ice cream sundaes for lunch.

2771
03:38:07.500 --> 03:38:20.500
Having packed my lunch that day, I gave him a rain check and it was agreed that our next session day, we were on for sundaes.

2772
03:38:20.500 --> 03:38:27.500
We had no idea that day would be his last lunch here in Concord.

2773
03:38:27.500 --> 03:38:37.000
Skip will be remembered for his bright smile, the twinkle in his eyes, and his caring and giving heart.

2774
03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:47.000
Representative Manjapudi and I were lucky to have spent so many hours with him during campaigns listening to his stories.

2775
03:38:47.000 --> 03:38:51.500
He was a gentleman and a very good friend.

2776
03:38:51.500 --> 03:39:07.000
I hope you can join me in keeping Skip's four children, Richard, Aaron, Leslie, and Tracy, as well as his six grandchildren, in your thoughts and prayers in the coming days.

2777
03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:15.500
Thank you, Representative Cleaver, for your service to our country, to our state, and to our city.

2778
03:39:15.500 --> 03:39:19.500
You will be missed more than you know.

2779
03:39:19.500 --> 03:39:32.500
Can we all stand for a moment of silence for our former colleague skip cleaver Without objection, the remarks will be printed in the permanent journal.

2780
03:39:32.500 --> 03:39:34.500
Thank you, Mr.

2781
03:39:34.500 --> 03:39:36.500
Speaker.

2782
03:39:36.500 --> 03:39:38.500
Thank you.

2783
03:39:38.500 --> 03:39:45.000
I just wanted to make a quick comment about Skip Cleaver, our representative.

2784
03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:48.500
Chair recognizes Representative Shewitt for unanimous consent.

2785
03:39:48.500 --> 03:39:50.500
Thank you.

2786
03:39:50.500 --> 03:39:54.000
Chair recognizes Representative Shewitt for unanimous consent.

2787
03:39:54.000 --> 03:39:56.000
Thank you, Mr.

2788
03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:58.000
Speaker.

2789
03:39:58.000 --> 03:40:11.500
I'm sure you're all aware of the significance of this date, the 81st anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, presaging our entry into World War II.

2790
03:40:11.500 --> 03:40:13.500
In remembering that...

2791
03:40:13.500 --> 03:40:21.500
the 81st anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, presaging our entry into World War II.

2792
03:40:21.500 --> 03:40:29.000
In remembering that event, I would like to share an experience I had in 2016.

2793
03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:39.000
I took a trip to Hawaii with some old friends, the Harness family from my old neighborhood in Southern California.

2794
03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:58.000
Like my own late father, I knew that Bob, their father, was a veteran of the war, but also like my dad, he didn't talk about it much with his kids, and certainly not with us neighbor kids.

2795
03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:14.000
So in October of 2016, it was my great honor to accompany this member of the greatest generation, along with his wife and daughter, on his first visit to the Arizona Memorial.

2796
03:41:14.000 --> 03:41:24.500
As we boarded the memorial, Bob paused to salute his mates, over 1,100 of whom are still entombed in their ship.

2797
03:41:24.500 --> 03:41:35.500
He was quiet for a while, taking in the rusting hulk and the awesomeness of the gleaming white memorial that straddles it.

2798
03:41:35.500 --> 03:41:50.000
We slowly made our way to the diagrams of the ship below, and one of the Park Service guides, noticing Bob's World War II cap, asked about his service.

2799
03:41:50.000 --> 03:42:03.500
Bob told him that he had served in the Navy, in the Pacific, and described his destroyer, the Blue, and some of the action they had seen.

2800
03:42:03.500 --> 03:42:09.500
Several other visitors gathered around by this time, listening to his memories.

2801
03:42:09.500 --> 03:42:33.000
Bob said they had tied up in Pearl during the war and he knew that the Arizona was still submerged there but of course no one could visit it then and he couldn't make out for sure just where in the harbor his ship would have birthed.

2802
03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:46.500
The Park Service Guide smiled a little and explained that of course the area had changed quite a bit in the 70 plus years since the war.

2803
03:42:46.500 --> 03:42:48.500
Thank you.

2804
03:42:48.500 --> 03:43:01.500
The Park Service Guide smiled a little and explained that, of course, the area had changed quite a bit in the 70-plus years since the war.

2805
03:43:01.500 --> 03:43:12.500
He then told Bob to go over to a particular pillar at the side of the memorial and to look behind it.

2806
03:43:12.500 --> 03:43:23.000
He said there's a rusted piece of the superstructure of the Arizona protruding there, and he invited Bob to touch it.

2807
03:43:23.000 --> 03:43:27.000
Leads to say it was an emotional moment.

2808
03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:46.500
Many of you may know that the USS Missouri, the big Moe, on whose decks the final surrender papers of World War II were signed, is now moored at Ford's Island, just behind and visible from the Arizona Memorial.

2809
03:43:46.500 --> 03:43:48.500
Thank you.

2810
03:43:48.500 --> 03:43:58.500
of World War II were signed is now moored at Ford's Island, just behind and visible from the Arizona Memorial.

2811
03:43:58.500 --> 03:44:14.500
So visitors witnessed the beginning and the end of our involvement in that war, and I'm sure that somehow the crew of the Arizona know that their sacrifice was not in vain.

2812
03:44:14.500 --> 03:44:23.500
That was my fourth trip to the Arizona Memorial, but it's definitely the one I will never forget.

2813
03:44:23.500 --> 03:44:25.500
Thank you.

2814
03:44:25.500 --> 03:44:29.000
The chair recognizes Maria Perez, unanimous consent.

2815
03:44:29.000 --> 03:44:31.000
Thank you Mr.

2816
03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:33.000
Speaker and members.

2817
03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:43.500
Today I raise to give my thoughts and praise to the Peruvian community here in New Hampshire and around the world.

2818
03:44:43.500 --> 03:44:47.500
Today, the president of Peru dissolved the Congress.

2819
03:44:47.500 --> 03:44:51.000
I have relatives and friends in Peru.

2820
03:44:51.000 --> 03:44:55.000
The whole country is in lockdown right now.

2821
03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:59.500
The airport and everything is shut down right now.

2822
03:44:59.500 --> 03:45:06.500
And my thoughts and praise are with everyone from the Peruvian community right now.

2823
03:45:06.500 --> 03:45:18.000
The airport and everything is shut down right now and my thoughts and prayers are with everyone from the Peruvian community right now.

2824
03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:20.000
Hopefully they found peace.

2825
03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:28.000
Hopefully this issue is resolved as soon as possible and that's all I want to say.

2826
03:45:28.000 --> 03:45:34.000
Hopefully everyone can keep the Peruvian community in Utah's and prayers today.

2827
03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:36.000
Thank you.

2828
03:45:36.000 --> 03:45:38.000
More reasoning, Member Rice.

2829
03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:40.000
Thank you, Mr.

2830
03:45:40.000 --> 03:45:42.000
Speaker.

2831
03:45:42.000 --> 03:45:55.000
On this Pearl Harbor Day, I would move that the remarks of Representative Shewitt, her touching testimony before this body, be placed in the permanent journal.

2832
03:45:55.000 --> 03:45:57.000
Without objection.

2833
03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:02.000
The organizational session of 23-24 House of Representatives is adjourned.
