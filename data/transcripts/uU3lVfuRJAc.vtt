abart I represent District 12.
we

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
three Wars in Nashua Mason Rindge Hollis
 
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
Brookline New Hope switch and Greenville
 
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
all right so we've got the uh got the
 
00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 align:start position:0%
sound how you doing
 
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
all right uh so as the prime sponsor of
 
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
this bill this bill basically changes
 
00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
the membership of the board of
 
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing it increases the
 
00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
board of jurisdiction to matters under
 
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
RSA 301a
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
on a consumer Cooperative Association
 
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 align:start position:0%
and it gives the tenant association
 
00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 align:start position:0%
standings with the board of
 
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing
 
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh again this bill basically changes the
 
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
membership of the board of Manufacturing
 
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 align:start position:0%
Housing and includes membership of
 
00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 align:start position:0%
Resident owned communities it also
 
00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 align:start position:0%
increases the board of jurisdiction like
 
00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
I just read to add dispute resolution
 
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
process for both the investor owned and
 
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
Resident owned Manufacturing Housing
 
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.570 align:start position:0%
Resident owned Manufacturing Housing
communities

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
this increases uh the increase in
 
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction will not be a burden to the
 
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
board as their website lists only three
 
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
cases since 2019.
 
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh which is the most recent information
 
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
that's been given
 
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's basically a common sense approach
 
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
that this bill for brides it is used to
 
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 align:start position:0%
uh use that existing board to hear
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
disputes from both investor owned and
 
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
Resident owned Community residents
 
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities represent
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
one-third of all the Manufacturing
 
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
Housing parks in the state
 
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
more resident Representatives on the
 
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
board can identify and deal with issues
 
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
specific to resident resident owned
 
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.090 align:start position:0%
specific to resident resident owned
communities

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
and expanding the membership of the
 
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
board allows for a broader range of
 
00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
housing expertise issues and choices
 
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 align:start position:0%
a recreated board will be less focused
 
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 align:start position:0%
on the business of owning the
 
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing parks and more on
 
00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
solving the problems of mostly low to
 
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 align:start position:0%
moderate income homeowners
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
the Senate Amendment reduces the number
 
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
of members on the board from 11 to 5 and
 
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
added the process for oplc to field
 
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
complaints and if there are any uh
 
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 align:start position:0%
technical things I I have some people
 
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
here that would like to to speak on it
 
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
we run into that a lot but uh
 
00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony Madam chair
 
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Senator I have a
 
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of of questions that you should
 
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
be able to answer the first question is
 
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
that the governor repealed this board in
 
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and there was no opposition
 
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
in the house to leaving it in-house to
 
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 align:start position:0%
leaving that repeal in House Bill too so
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
uh you are essentially recreating the
 
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay some things are just out of our
 
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.630 align:start position:0%
okay some things are just out of our
control

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
indeed okay so you haven't coordinated
 
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
this with the governor not yet not yet
 
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.009 align:start position:0%
this with the governor not yet not yet
okay

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay uh the other question is you appear
 
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
to have stuck it into the
 
00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
certification this strikes me as
 
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
something that would be more appropriate
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately in the Department of
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
Justice the consumer complaints division
 
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh is there any reason you didn't do
 
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 align:start position:0%
that or have you considered doing that
 
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 align:start position:0%
I'd not consider that but I'm open to
 
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
suggestions all right thank you does
 
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the committee have a
 
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.210 align:start position:0%
anyone else on the committee have a
question

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%

we hope to see you more often
 
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 align:start position:0%

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
um back in 2019 we all got a letter
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
saying the entire Board of directives
 
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 align:start position:0%
was resigning effective immediately
 
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
and they had given us a list of things
 
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
that you know we could that we could try
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
and take on our own
 
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
so I went on a campaign and tried to get
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
four other neighbors together and put
 
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 align:start position:0%
together an annual meeting
 
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I did so and I was voted elected
 
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.189 align:start position:0%
and I did so and I was voted elected
president

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
uh we had reached the Quorum and um
 
00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
uh we had reached the Quorum and um
so

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
on June 1st 2019 I became elected the
 
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 align:start position:0%
president of Centennial Estates
 
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
I was sent sexually explicit messages
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
from teenage girls being raped to
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
bedroom sex scenes with animals to gay
 
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.210 align:start position:0%
bedroom sex scenes with animals to gay
bashing

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
and it just goes on and on the treasurer
 
00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
had never paid taxes she had owed over
 
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars on her home at the
 
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:41.450 align:start position:0%
nine thousand dollars on her home at the
time

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's ruined my life
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
since then
 
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
once I found out about the lawsuit and
 
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
how Roc had been swindling money out of
 
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 align:start position:0%
our accounts to pay for a lawsuit
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a bad situation but
 
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
anyway they they contacted Hodges one
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
time and and stated that I had resigned
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
my position
 
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
and nobody's really ever talked to me
 
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.969 align:start position:0%
and nobody's really ever talked to me
since

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
now it's been four years we haven't had
 
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
any monthly meetings
 
00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 align:start position:0%
we haven't had any annual meetings
 
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
we've had no elections
 
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
right now we have a husband and a wife
 
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
pretending to be board members who have
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
locked themselves up in their houses and
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
are not posting any agendas and nobody
 
00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
our water is contaminated with peepas
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
we're being injected with chlorine in
 
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
our water we have septic in our water
 
00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419 align:start position:0%
the park looks like a third world
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
country like something you'd see in
 
00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:47.809 align:start position:0%
country like something you'd see in
Mexico

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
Mexico
 
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
but meanwhile we don't even own a
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
lawnmower we have 24 acres and we have
 
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
zero assets and every time I call Kelly
 
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
or Tara at the Community Loan Fund
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
my complaints go unanswered over 50
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
emails since 2019 begging them to get
 
00:07:04.189 --> 00:07:04.199 align:start position:0%
involved and take control of the park
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
and or put me back in or do something
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
everything goes unanswered well
 
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.890 align:start position:0%
everything goes unanswered well
so

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
this year when they were trying to get
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
out of having another annual meeting I
 
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
started calling and they had one of my
 
00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
neighbors come up and I got punched in
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
the mouth and all my teeth knocked out
 
00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
because I was asking
 
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
demanding that Roc have a meeting so
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
when I see this and I see that you want
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
to that they want to have two positions
 
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
on a board of directors I say nope I I'm
 
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
thinking sb64 you need to sit and listen
 
00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 align:start position:0%
to the residents of the resident owned
 
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
communities and we need to come up with
 
00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
a serious plan to be able to hold
 
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund accountable for
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
their actions because right now we're
 
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
missing over four hundred thousand
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
dollars in our Park funds from a line of
 
00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:54.419 align:start position:0%
credit they've given unelected members
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
to spend
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
I've called the oplc I called the
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
attorney general I send the emails
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
nobody has control of anything
 
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
and this is a 58 24 acre
 
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
58 unit Mobile Home Park
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
and nobody has control oversight there's
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
nobody to call there's nobody to file a
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.290 align:start position:0%
 
Bonnie

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
is it okay if I sit with her sure
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
please and please introduce yourself
 
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
please oh yes my name is Bonnie garies
 
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:04.860 align:start position:0%
Bonnie what garies g-a-w-r-y-s good
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Bonnie garies and I am a
 
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
resident of Bayview Community co-op in
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
Allenstown and I'm here today to testify
 
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
in our position of SB 203
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
Fairview as well as many other co-ops
 
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200 align:start position:0%
are in dire need of a dispute resolution
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
program but this bill is not the answer
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
I have been working with many other
 
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
residential communities over the past
 
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
three years to address the issues and
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
have been fought by the New Hampshire
 
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund every step of the
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
way until now
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
Bayview became a co-op three years ago
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
and for those three years our park has
 
00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:43.019 align:start position:0%
been led by three different sets of
 
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
boards of directors and now our park is
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
in shambles we have experienced board
 
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:50.100 align:start position:0%
members not following our bylaws not
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
applying the rules consistently to
 
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.150 align:start position:0%
applying the rules consistently to
everyone

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
that is a resident in the park this is
 
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
not unique to our community as a New
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Health fund has
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
testified in the past
 
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:03.779 align:start position:0%
SB 203 was filed by the New Hampshire
 
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund in response to SB 64
 
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700 align:start position:0%
that creates a study committee on
 
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
Resident owned manufactured housing
 
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.389 align:start position:0%
Resident owned manufactured housing
parts

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:11.399 align:start position:0%
parts
 
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
despite excuse me disputes and oversight
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
of Resident owned manufactured housing
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
Parks the goal was to try to develop a
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution program at no expense
 
00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
to the state and to determine if there
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
are appropriate oversights of Resident
 
00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
owned communities
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
excuse me this is where he dared me and
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
SB 203 gets the membership of the board
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing and places the
 
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
burden of resolving these conflicts on
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
it allows the New Hampshire Community
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
Home Loan Fund the lender to nominate a
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
resident to the board removes the member
 
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire buyer Association
 
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
and replaces it with a housing advocacy
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
member and it removes legislative
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
participation on the board this does not
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
create a balanced board
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
these are not pro-resident changes these
 
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
are pro-new Hampshire Community Loan
 
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:04.500 align:start position:0%
Fund changes these changes will only
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
result in protecting the New Hampshire
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
Community Home Loan Fund and their
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
attempts to smother residents voices and
 
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:12.140 align:start position:0%
complaints which allows them to continue
 
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
to lure residents into purchasing their
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
Parks which directly benefits The Loan
 
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.470 align:start position:0%
Parks which directly benefits The Loan
Fund

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
Fund
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
please understand
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
that not all residents in Resident or
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
communities wanted to purchase their
 
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.310 align:start position:0%
communities wanted to purchase their
parks

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
parks
 
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
it does not take a majority of residents
 
00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
to vote to purchase a park
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
isn't that odd
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
for example our park in our park we have
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
287 units
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%
and only 68 people voted to purchase the
 
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
and only 68 people voted to purchase the
park

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
park
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think if you had a larger base of
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
support to purchase the park we wouldn't
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
have these problems not to mention the
 
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
scare tactics Scare Tactics that
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
Community Home Loan Fund used to present
 
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
to us to purchase the pack or Finance
 
00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:58.200 align:start position:0%
the park from them I respectfully ask
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
the committee to vote to kill this bill
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
and support an alternative bill that
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
will bring the stakeholders together to
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
resolve these issues without burdening
 
00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
I hope my testimony will not put a
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
larger Target on my back by the New
 
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund as they
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:17.459 align:start position:0%
they have done enough damage to my
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
character and assassinated my character
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
my character
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
to the point where I am now looking into
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
legal counsel I will be happy to answer
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%

my name is Louise Rideout I'm a resident
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
of the Bayview Crossing Cooperative in
 
00:12:59.449 --> 00:12:59.459 align:start position:0%
Allenstown New Hampshire I've been there
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
since before
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
we became a co-op
 
00:13:06.769 --> 00:13:06.779 align:start position:0%
and I have I'll read what I wrote
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
I am voicing my opposition con concerns
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 203 because of two
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
important factors first Senate Bill 203
 
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
will be a burden to New Hampshire
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers funding will be needed for the
 
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board to exist I am
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
as I am a homeowner so at a very
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
difficult time in this economic
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
environment we should not be a burden
 
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
rocks are already stigmatized as
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
recipients of the generosity of
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
donations and funding as we are labeled
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
as low to moderate income homeowners and
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
please remember the term homeowners
 
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
homeowners and taxpayers but we really
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
know that is not all truthful I question
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
the involvement of New Hampshire
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund for this bill
 
00:13:58.129 --> 00:13:58.139 align:start position:0%
it is clearly a conflict of interest for
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
lenders of Resident and owned
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
communities to be participants on any
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
type of resolution board I don't see how
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
you can see it any other way than the
 
00:14:10.009 --> 00:14:10.019 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
because when we have issues
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
with them as I will explain to you what
 
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
happened just this week to me
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
there's no resolution for us
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
and we're targeted in my personal
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
experience with New Hampshire Community
 
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund I realized that they might not
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
be able to be unbiased
 
00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
I have an email which I will show you
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I sent to Chris classby regarding
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
our forensic audit because our Co-op is
 
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
currently for a year and a half been in
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
a non-monetary default
 
00:14:43.009 --> 00:14:43.019 align:start position:0%
issued by Community Loan Fund and right
 
00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
now I'm afraid to say anything because
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that
 
00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
the powers that be with Community Loan
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
Fund will turn around and raise our
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
interest rate
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
so that that is something they could do
 
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to be held responsible
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
for so hopefully that is something they
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
won't do
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
now I I sent it about to Chris classby
 
00:15:05.569 --> 00:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
and I also forwarded it to Steve
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
Saltzman who is the CEO Tara Reardon who
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
is the vice president in Kelly
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
ciccarelli who is our technical advisor
 
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
I received an unintended email from
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
Steve Salzman which I brought with me
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
Senate and I I have to show you this
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
because I sent it to Chris when I
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
forwarded Steve sauceman didn't realize
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
he was sending back to me let's get
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
unified on the type of response
 
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
regarding Miss Rideout we'll use
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
and then he tried to retract
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
so if you want to use you put a bill
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
through that they have more power than
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
they already have over us it was going
 
00:15:51.889 --> 00:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
to hurt us a lot and I don't think
 
00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:53.459 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:56.279 align:start position:0%
Senator avod mentions that there needs
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
to be modernization of the manufactured
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
housing board but I don't understand
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
what he's referring to I did leave a
 
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
message but he never reached out to me
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
to get back in touch Senate Bill 64
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
addresses the needs for all manufactured
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
home parks in an unbiased manner that
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
would allow members homeowners to go
 
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
forward without fear of retaliation
 
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
we deserve to have a board that would be
 
00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
honest and trustworthy without the deck
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
being stacked to accommodate New
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund having
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
more unnecessary control of Our Lives
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
the solution is in my eyes is to stop
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
this bill and give more effort to the
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
success of Senate bill 64.
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening Louise Rhino
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like you to share
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
this with you
 
00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative a
 
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.329 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative a
bears

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.249 --> 00:16:52.259 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for being here to
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
share your experience with us so
 
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
as I'm reviewing the bill the members on
 
00:16:59.930 --> 00:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
the board are moving from nine members
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
to five members and
 
00:17:06.409 --> 00:17:06.419 align:start position:0%
from what you're saying what would your
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
choice be for who would sit on the board
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
if they're not appointed who who would
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
sit on the board
 
00:17:14.809 --> 00:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
I would I would think it would be
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
somebody that is absolutely unbiased and
 
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.130 align:start position:0%
somebody that is absolutely unbiased and
non-partial

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
non-partial
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know somebody that
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
maybe a retired person that has a lot of
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
experience and negotiations
 
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
nobody involved in that lending process
 
00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
because lenders
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh frightening you know what I'm saying
 
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're like they control you they tell
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
you what you can and can't do so and not
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
people that are hand-picked you know
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
maybe people can put their requests and
 
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
you know people at the parks can ask to
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
be in and maybe they can be reviewed
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
like I don't know what you might think
 
00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
that would be a good idea like a say a
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
retired um legislator a retired judge
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
somebody that has experience in the
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations with
 
00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
any type of dispute but to have have our
 
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.470 align:start position:0%
any type of dispute but to have have our
lender

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
lender
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
A lender be
 
00:18:09.529 --> 00:18:09.539 align:start position:0%
part of this is we're afraid to even you
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
know have any contact with these people
 
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900 align:start position:0%
please don't do that to us thank you
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
yes please go on I'm I'm sorry guards
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
again I do I I have to mirror but
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
what she's saying
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
because the two of us have been
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
retaliated against since we've started
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
being very vocal in fact last year a
 
00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
member from the New Hampshire Community
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
Home Loan Fund went to our board and
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
told our board to contact the parks
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
attorney to have Louisa Knight evicted
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
from the park because we were too vocal
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
so having people that Community Home
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund pick to sit on these boards
 
00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
that's not going to help us at all
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's not I mean
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
right now I have about a hundred parks
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the state that I that call me with
 
00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:03.720 align:start position:0%
their problems because they are not
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
getting any response and no help from
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
Community Home Loan Fund I myself have
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
filed six complaints in the past seven
 
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.409 align:start position:0%
filed six complaints in the past seven
months

00:19:12.409 --> 00:19:12.419 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I have not heard one word
 
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:17.640 align:start position:0%
we are having a forensic audit because
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
our park is missing a half a million
 
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.890 align:start position:0%
our park is missing a half a million
dollars

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.150 align:start position:0%
dollars
and

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire Community Loan
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
Fund was not doing the fiduciary duty
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we were paying the form I correct
 
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:32.100 align:start position:0%
every month consequently
 
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
we're missing a half million dollars and
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted to do anything about it
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
until Louise and I finally contacted the
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um who do we call the attorney general
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
for the charitable organization and he
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
has requested a forensic audit be done
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
which I don't think that we being bfu
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
Community Co-op should have to pay for
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not our fault our money's
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
missing the fault lies on Community Home
 
00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund who didn't do their job but
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
again people are too afraid to speak up
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
they are scared to death because of
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
retaliation especially when they see
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
what's happened to Louise and I I'm
 
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:07.980 align:start position:0%
being honest I'm fearful today
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
so I don't know what's coming down the
 
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
pike I've had my car damaged at my home
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's scary but like I said but they
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
have my character to have my character
 
00:20:24.049 --> 00:20:24.059 align:start position:0%
no that's not good because I'm vocal
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
because I'm trying to stick up for
 
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:27.660 align:start position:0%
members in these co-ops give us some
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
good good foundation for us we all
 
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:32.700 align:start position:0%
deserve it we pay taxes we deserve it
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
you deserve unbiased help these people
 
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
need to be heard they they need we need
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
to be heard
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you madam thank you very much
 
00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:46.460 align:start position:0%
are there any representative gerhardt
 
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:49.860 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
so the the main concerns that you guys
 
00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
want fixed
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
have to do with the financial aspects of
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
just so basically people coming in
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
giving bags of money to people it
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
disappears now you guys are on the hook
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
board is that the main thrust of what's
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
going on my point being is why can't
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
this be done at the local Town level at
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
some point or do the town you know what
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
I'm saying the local entities
 
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:12.140 align:start position:0%
the town is not involved
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
for fraud for you know what I'm saying I
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
just has to go Statewide I'm just I'm
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
many many agencies I was a terrible
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
employee for 18 years so I have called
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
many places and it's hard for people to
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
want to even get involved because the
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
the power of that Community Long John
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
has in this state dominates the whole
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
thing yes I think they're not regulated
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
by anybody
 
00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:48.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that a
 
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:51.299 align:start position:0%
non-monetary default status can you
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
explain that
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
when we are paying our loans
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry we are paying our loans but
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
there are some aspects of our loan
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
documents that require us to have
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
certain things done properly like having
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
the boards be filled five members of the
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
boards to be able to have the budgets
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
done all the paperwork has to be filed
 
00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:16.980 align:start position:0%
in a timely manner and we have to have a
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
good relationship with our management
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
company and our management company is
 
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:22.980 align:start position:0%

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
I previously had passed out my testimony
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
to you a little chart that shows you the
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
configuration of the members of the
 
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.049 align:start position:0%
configuration of the members of the
board

00:23:23.049 --> 00:23:23.059 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
before SB 203 and afterwards and then a
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
printout from the website for the
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution board which I think
 
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
is really helpful and um
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
is a gives you some idea of the dispute
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
resolution process in place now
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
my name is Tara Reardon I'm here in
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
support of Senate Bill 203 and I work
 
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Community Loan
 
00:23:51.649 --> 00:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
Fund I passed you out the annual report
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
it has a lot about us in there so I
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
won't rehash any of that
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
it is a 40 year old Community Loan Fund
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
that serves the citizens of the State of
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and it provides access to
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
Capital money loans that Banks won't
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
give people because they won't qualify
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
for them and that's our mission to serve
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
that group of people
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
the oldest and largest program of the
 
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Community Loan Fund is
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
Rock NH and that stands for Resident
 
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
owned communities New Hampshire
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
and it is how the Loan Fund got started
 
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
when residents land under their home
 
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
comes up for sale this legislature very
 
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
forward thinking back in the 90s not
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
only made their manufactured housing
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
real property but it also gave them an
 
00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to purchase that land under
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
their homes and that was the beginning
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the rock program
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
when you own a home on on rented land
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
that's a very unstable kind of Housing
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
and having a resident owned community
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
stabilizes that forever in perpetuity
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
these rocks are organized as not for
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
profit consumer cooperatives under RSA
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
301a and when they if if they ever chose
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
that no one has ever chosen to sell
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
their Community they can't profit from
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
that sale that would go to another like
 
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
kind affordable housing use
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
so thanks to you and the people who have
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
sat in the seats before you there's 9
 
00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
000 households in the state of New
 
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and 145 different communities
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
that are rocks that don't have to worry
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
about having to ever have the land sold
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
and them moving their home or walking
 
00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
away from the biggest asset that they
 
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
will ever own so it is a really smart
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
Common Sense affordable housing solution
 
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
that this legislature created and it has
 
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
now spread across the United States
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
where there's over 300 rocks in the
 
00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
United States right now
 
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.510 align:start position:0%
United States right now
foreign

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
when we're working with rocks is that
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
them owning their home and paying for
 
00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
the land rent their taxes and insurance
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
is cheaper than the two-bedroom rental
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
in the same area so a really important
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
source of affordable housing in all of
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
your communities you probably all have a
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
rock in your community I'd love to
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
answer your questions at any time if
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
you're interested in visiting them and
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
meeting the hard-working people that
 
00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
work there
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so the the makeup of these
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
communities is low-income people we do
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
because of our mission have to serve
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
low-income folks and we do income
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
surveys routinely 75 percent of the
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
people that live in these communities
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
are at or below 80 percent of area
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
median income 10 of them are veterans 28
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
of them are disability have a disability
 
00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
two Rock communities that we work with
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
the town clerk lives there there's a
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
community in Loudoun that a retired
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
police officer is actually the president
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
of that Co-op right now teachers County
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
Nursing Home employees and more
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
so of those 145 rocks in New Hampshire
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
those 9 000 households most of them run
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
very very smoothly but there's people
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
involved and people don't always get
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
along with each other and prior boards
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think the next board
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
is doing it the way they are so disputes
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
arise about fences about parking about
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
dogs about meeting notices about their
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
finances and sometimes a board believes
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
it has more power than it does and
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
somebody needs to resolve that dispute
 
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board has
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
existed since the 1990s and in the early
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
years it heard between 12 and 20 cases a
 
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
year and those cases are almost evenly
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
divided between folks in Resident owned
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
communities and folks in investor own
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
communities which is an important Point
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
here the study committee that has been
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
alluded to before
 
00:27:57.169 --> 00:27:57.179 align:start position:0%
is about the oversight of rocks this
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
isn't just about rocks in the senate
 
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:01.940 align:start position:0%
committee a woman very passionately
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
testified that routinely her water got
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
turned off when she was getting ready
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
for work or or trying to go out and she
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
didn't dare say a thing to her landlord
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
about that for fear of she would be
 
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:17.460 align:start position:0%
retaliated against so there's disputes
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
in all kinds of these communities and
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
since 2019 the I checked with the oplc
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
no cases have been heard since that time
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
could be coveted related maybe not but
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
we've had three residents call us just
 
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
this year that said when they called the
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board they were
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
referred the park Owners Association the
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
park Owners Association has very
 
00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:42.059 align:start position:0%
different goals than the resident owned
 
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
communities you know
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
and just yesterday Senator avard got an
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
email from someone who had an issue
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
called the manufactured housing board
 
00:28:55.250 --> 00:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
was referred to 603 legal aid they they
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
didn't even field the complaint for him
 
00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:00.299 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with Lindsay about the
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
revamping Lindsay Courtney excuse me
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
about the revamping about HB 655 what
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
would be included in that in this bill
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
and that is why Senator Carson and
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins Coker in the Senate
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
re-re-did this the uh the composition of
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board to make
 
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
it a smaller board and left in the added
 
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that we had contemplated of
 
00:29:27.529 --> 00:29:27.539 align:start position:0%
uh regular meetings meeting notices what
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
happens when a residence being expelled
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
from the community
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
so when the manufactured housing board
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
was formed there were only 30 rocks in
 
00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:39.380 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and there's
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
145 now we believe the composition of
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
the board two Park owners two residents
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
one from an investor owned Community one
 
00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
from Iraq and someone from housing
 
00:29:50.769 --> 00:29:50.779 align:start position:0%
action New Hampshire somebody
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
experienced in low-income housing and
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
the issues that come with that is a fair
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
representation in a me likely to be a
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
better board and a fairer complaint
 
00:30:03.889 --> 00:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
board for that
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
so the jurisdiction goes beyond just the
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
reasonableness of the rules in the Park
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
which is what the jurisdiction is now as
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
you can see from the handout the board
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
already has a really well done
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
um website and we believe that this is a
 
00:30:20.990 --> 00:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
forum where a resident or a park owner
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
can represent themselves we're not going
 
00:30:25.669 --> 00:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
to add to the superior court docket or
 
00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
have somebody incur legal fees in order
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
to solve this dispute these are
 
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
low-income folks and it is a path that
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
they can afford to do on their own
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'd like the committee to find this bill
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass we're happy to work with
 
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:40.980 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions and clarify
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
anything that you've already heard and I
 
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
will say that money is often
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
um an issue in these communities as
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
you've heard from people who have
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
testified before bear view Cooperative
 
00:31:00.889 --> 00:31:00.899 align:start position:0%
is undergoing a forensic Financial
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
author uh audit right now because
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
there's money missing and the money is
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
missing because a board member signed a
 
00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
letter uh to Merrimack County Savings
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
Bank asking to have some of those funds
 
00:31:15.769 --> 00:31:15.779 align:start position:0%
diverted and that's what's being
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
investigated and that forensic audit
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
and that may lead to charges there we've
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
had embezzlement in communities before
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
where folks have ended up in jail
 
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
um we have offered the uh had a
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Department of
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
Justice about whether this is better
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
situated there and they would prefer not
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
to have that as part of their
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction their self-governing boards
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
we don't get a vote in anything we do
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
enforce our loan covenants and documents
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
they have to have clean audits clean
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
Financial records most of these groups
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
have Professional Property Management
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
that does that for them unless somebody
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
is intentionally diverting funds which
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
is exactly what's happened at Bear view
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
here but um where the source of the down
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
payment money that allows these groups
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
to buy their communities and of course
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
we have loan covenants that go with that
 
00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.710 align:start position:0%
we have loan covenants that go with that
there

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
um I will be happy to answer any
 
00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
questions or clarify or work with a
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that comes after this bill
 
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
but I think a dispute resolution
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
forum is in order wherever it sits in
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Gould
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
did you say that the homeowners
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
um are not allowed to sell to recognize
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
any profit from the investment in their
 
00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:52.029 align:start position:0%
any profit from the investment in their
property

00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
homeowners are always free to sell their
 
00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
homes on the open real estate market
 
00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
list it they own their homes
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
individually the community is owned as a
 
00:33:02.930 --> 00:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
consumer Cooperative not in an
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
individual's name but in the case of
 
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:07.860 align:start position:0%
bear view bear view cooperative
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
if that property is sold because they
 
00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:13.740 align:start position:0%
are organized as a not-for-profit they
 
00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:16.140 align:start position:0%
do not benefit from the sale of that
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
they'd get their membership fees back
 
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:20.820 align:start position:0%
which are someplace between 25 and 500
 
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
depending on where you are but the money
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
would go to the charitable trust
 
00:33:27.649 --> 00:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
Division and go to another like kind
 
00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
affordable housing effort
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
I was very active I was head of Habitat
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
for Humanity in New Hampshire back when
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
all of this was put in place
 
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:43.140 align:start position:0%
and I remember the the um vilification
 
00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:46.019 align:start position:0%
and criticism that Habitat for Humanity
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
homeowners would be allowed to sell
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
their property and and recognize a
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
profit and that this this program was
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
intended to keep low-income housing for
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
low-income people how many times have
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
you pointed out in your testimony that
 
00:34:06.529 --> 00:34:06.539 align:start position:0%
these are very poor people
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
um we that is part of our mission at the
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund my question was how
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
many times did you point out and I don't
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that somebody needs to
 
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
um that somebody needs to
um

00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
resolve disputes that arise and I'm I'm
 
00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:38.700 align:start position:0%
hearing that it sounds as though these
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
folks have moved into these communities
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
and then suddenly the ownership changes
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
and they've gotten involved in a
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
leadership position that they hadn't
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
really signed on for when they purchased
 
00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:56.220 align:start position:0%
their location in the Parks
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh it appears that the current board has
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
been unable to resolve a lot of disputes
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
from what we're hearing
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
can you tell us why you think this new
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
board would be better at that or if it
 
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh so the manufactured housing board at
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state level hasn't heard any
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
disputes there is a board that governs
 
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
each resident owned Community that's
 
00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:26.339 align:start position:0%
elected by the members themselves people
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
who have testified have been members of
 
00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:30.359 align:start position:0%
their boards
 
00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:33.079 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's rules interpretation
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the failure to hold
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
meetings which is something that a
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
member could bring to the manufactured
 
00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:41.940 align:start position:0%
housing board if a meeting hasn't been
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
held in accordance with their bylaws and
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
then the board is called on the carpet
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
to ask why there hasn't been a meeting
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
or why the meetings haven't been
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
properly noticed so a member can go to
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that I think just the very existence of
 
00:35:59.810 --> 00:35:59.820 align:start position:0%
a functioning board that does make those
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of decisions
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
May improve the behavior
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
of sub-members because they know that
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
there is a dispute resolution for
 
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:11.339 align:start position:0%
residents that aren't being heard in
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
their own communities
 
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you personally bear
 
00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:20.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:23.940 align:start position:0%
why now why
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
change the
 
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
board from nine to five I notice on the
 
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
website that
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
it's required to have two members from
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire House of
 
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives which remain vacant at
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:45.859 align:start position:0%
in that manner why now
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
we filed uh SB 203 before we saw hb2 to
 
00:36:53.089 --> 00:36:53.099 align:start position:0%
see that it was going to be eliminated
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
because we thought the function could be
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
better oplc told us that the the
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
legislators appointed never showed up
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
they didn't they weren't interested they
 
00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:07.460 align:start position:0%
didn't actually go to it oplc's
 
00:37:10.069 --> 00:37:10.079 align:start position:0%
streamlining of the number of boards
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they have also included the size of
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
some boards making them a little weirdly
 
00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.950 align:start position:0%
some boards making them a little weirdly
um

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:18.829 --> 00:37:18.839 align:start position:0%
a higher level to reach a quorum so that
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
made sense and for us it also made sense
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
that now that there's about 450
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing parks in the state
 
00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
one-third of those are now resident
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
owned when this board was formed that
 
00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579 align:start position:0%
was Far different there were only 30 at
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
that time it was a fairly new phenomenon
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
so the need for dispute resolution has
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
always existed the makeup of the board
 
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
is just changing with the character of
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing in the state of New
 
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I never could have
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
anticipated that the this was the year
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
that the governor would decide that oplc
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
needed to be overhauled that's just a
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'd like to comment that the oplc
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
has not been involved in this board as
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
far as I know it's not attached to them
 
00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:11.660 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
it lives at oplc some staffer from oplc
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
answers the phone when uh when we go
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
lovely uh
 
00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about your
 
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about your
um

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
about the stories we hear about
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
retaliation and that's something that
 
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
I've heard from a number of constituents
 
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
because I do have a number of both
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
resident owned and non-resident owned
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
um homes in my in my district
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
and so I'm very concerned about the
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
stories of retaliation
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
and in fact one one park in Epsom was uh
 
00:38:59.930 --> 00:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
considering becoming resident down and
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't and due to uh flood
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
flooding issues they were not eligible
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so I had a lot of people concerned
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
about how the Community
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund was organized and how it was
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
attempting to
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
create a resident owned community
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
and which have not been answered yep we
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
worked with that community in Epsom
 
00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.430 align:start position:0%
worked with that community in Epsom
unfortunately

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of homes were not just in the
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
flood flood plain they were in the flood
 
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.030 align:start position:0%
flood flood plain they were in the flood
way

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
we were also working with cdbg and
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
another lender we couldn't finance that
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
whole thing it was a huge purchase price
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
and all of those lenders declined to
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
finance anything that had people
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
actually living in a flood way at that
 
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.290 align:start position:0%
actually living in a flood way at that
time

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
and and I agree with retaliation in
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
Parks people this job would be very easy
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
but for the people who have a need to
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
not treat their neighbors as kindly as
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
they should and I I think it's further
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
need for dispute resolution uh some kind
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
 
00:40:14.579 --> 00:40:15.829 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions representative
Billa

00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
Billa
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am yeah in the uh procedure
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
for filing a complaint could you explain
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
what that entails how someone files a
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
complaint and what the what the
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
resolution is uh uh certainly executive
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
director Courtney might be better suited
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
to answer this but my understanding is
 
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:37.020 align:start position:0%
there's an online Complaint Form that is
 
00:40:39.609 --> 00:40:39.619 align:start position:0%
filled out sent to
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
the board of manufactured housing
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
they'll make a decision whether they
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over that or not and
 
00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
then if so
 
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and the chair actually of the board
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housings here too he
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
could let you know how that works from
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
there's I guess a 25 fee for filing a
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
complaint but it can be waived can you
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
explain what the conditions are for
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
waving I don't know anything about what
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
the conditions for the waiver I'm sorry
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
I saw a director Courtney leave but I
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
have a question maybe you can answer
 
00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:31.550 align:start position:0%
have a question maybe you can answer
um

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
certification become involved in the
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
ones to field all the complaints
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
this is not a licensing this has nothing
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
to do with licensing
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
who's going to pay for the costs because
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
all the costs to run oplc come from
 
00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:55.700 align:start position:0%
licensees why is this in here
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't change where the board sat and
 
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
it has been there as long as I've been
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
familiar with the board we are totally
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
open to it sitting at the Department of
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
Justice if that's a better forum for it
 
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.609 align:start position:0%
Justice if that's a better forum for it
um

00:42:10.609 --> 00:42:10.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you you're correct about
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
the funding though that's
 
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
or any other questions representative
 
00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.990 align:start position:0%
or any other questions representative

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
O'Brien
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh Miss
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
Redding good to see you again nice to
 
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
see you uh thank you for taking my
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
question I'm very concerned
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
okay we heard from some of the people
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
that testified and they actually fear
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
and I'll take it as legitimate concerns
 
00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
what do you see as the fix to some of
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
that that may be in this particular bill
 
00:42:51.290 --> 00:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
can you upon on that a little bit
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
um bear view Cooperative in the
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
Allenstown has had a series of boards
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
um where one board is critical of what
 
00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:04.579 align:start position:0%
the other board did and does its best to
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
bring that to the Forefront
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know how the neighbors act when
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
where we are there for a board meeting
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're not on site they have a
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
professional property manager that does
 
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
their books we handle board meetings
 
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.730 align:start position:0%
their books we handle board meetings
um

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
there will be inquiries from residents
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
from time to time about a board matter
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
our policy and this is what our CEO
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
Saltzman was referring to is that when
 
00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:32.819 align:start position:0%
we give information out we give the same
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
information to everybody if somebody
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
asks a question we'll respond to the
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
board and that person and then everybody
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
is working from the same information
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
because there are some residents who
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
love to do the gotcha moment that they
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
told me this therefore I know something
 
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:51.660 align:start position:0%
that you don't know and we try to avoid
 
00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.390 align:start position:0%
that you don't know and we try to avoid
that

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:55.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative bear thank you madam
 
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:00.180 align:start position:0%
chair just one last question
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
do these people have any coaching for
 
00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
running a board knowing how to put
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
notice out anything like that the New
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Community Loan Fund Works uh
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
with about 90 to 100 of these boards
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
there's several that have paid their
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
loans off and don't have any interaction
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
with us anymore and we have on a yearly
 
00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
basis provide 20 000 hours of technical
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
assistance so in your first year prior
 
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
to buying and in your first year we're
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
at every board meeting we help with
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
every agenda all of that and then as um
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
as co-ops become more and more
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
independent we're able to just check in
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
with them before and after meetings to
 
00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
make sure they know what's going on
 
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
we also help them get funding for
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects that they need
 
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
to do and all kinds of ongoing trainings
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they can take advantage of by Zoom
 
00:44:58.970 --> 00:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
we have 20 people at traditionally on a
 
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
weeknight at a training about
 
00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
infrastructure or board management or
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Mr
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
this I think will be going to
 
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.829 align:start position:0%
this I think will be going to
subcommittee

00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative shuitt if you think
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
do you think our subcommittee's got to
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
handle this
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you we'll uh we'll add it
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chair members uh my
 
00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
name is Mark Tay
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I am an attorney I'm speaking in
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
opposition to Senate Bill 203. I've
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
served on a state board of manufactured
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
housing continuously since 2004.
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
and I'm its chair uh since 2007.
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm one of the two nominees to the
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
board from the New Hampshire
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association I do
 
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
have testimony
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
and now that I passed out my written
 
00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
testimony part of it was geared towards
 
00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
the former uh Senate Bill 203 not the
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
amendment the former bill called for a
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
membership of 11 increased from nine uh
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
the current bill before you drops that
 
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
membership to five the same concerns
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
hold though we have a proposed two
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
members from industry two members who
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
are residents and then one member from
 
00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.250 align:start position:0%
are residents and then one member from
this

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.010 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:18.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
manufactured how or the housing action
 
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee who I heard of Ms Raiden
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
testify that that's a low-income expert
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
so essentially the Optics of this newly
 
00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
constituted board suggests that that one
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
member will be deciding all future cases
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
coming before the board
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I say that because
 
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:42.589 align:start position:0%
um so I you know I say that because
um

00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
takes a while for a board to get some
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
cohesion and in the past when we did
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
have our Representative members our
 
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:53.420 align:start position:0%
public member and our member of the bar
 
00:47:57.050 --> 00:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh and as I said I'm the New Hampshire
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
appointee we do have another member of
 
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
the bar so the so-called bias members if
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
you want to use that label the two
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
industry the two
 
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:10.690 align:start position:0%
industry the two
um

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:10.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
a residents are outweighed by the number
 
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:15.290 align:start position:0%
a residents are outweighed by the number
of

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
um uh people who really don't have a
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
bias who bring a um an independent
 
00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
opinion to the board and that's really
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
helped the board Through The Years
 
00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.370 align:start position:0%
helped the board Through The Years
um

00:48:27.370 --> 00:48:27.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill also wants to substantially
 
00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
propose to substantially increase the
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the board of
 
00:48:38.329 --> 00:48:38.339 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and fundamentally
 
00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
change and we're a boy that hears rules
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
disputes our jurisdiction is clearly
 
00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
laid out and now
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the board would be asked to resolve a
 
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.030 align:start position:0%
um the board would be asked to resolve a
complex

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
corporate issues essentially these are
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
all governance issues that the board
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
really isn't equipped to handle and also
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
I should point out the board can't
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't have Equity Powers we're an
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
executive board we're not a Judicial
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
board although we're quasi-judicial but
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
we can't order
 
00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh Cooperative to hold a meeting so I
 
00:49:17.329 --> 00:49:17.339 align:start position:0%
don't know what the point of having to
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
come to us is but that's what this board
 
00:49:23.329 --> 00:49:23.339 align:start position:0%
uh Bill suggests
 
00:49:23.339 --> 00:49:25.309 align:start position:0%
uh Bill suggests
um

00:49:25.309 --> 00:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address some of the
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
history of our board uh it was formed in
 
00:49:31.319 --> 00:49:33.170 align:start position:0%
history of our board uh it was formed in
1994

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:33.180 align:start position:0%
1994
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
and at the beginning I think it served a
 
00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
really important Purpose with respect to
 
00:49:42.829 --> 00:49:42.839 align:start position:0%
park rules disputes uh it we did provide
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
a forum to fairly resolve rules issues
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
and we were pretty active over the last
 
00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
maybe 20 years or so
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
of resolving these violation complaints
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
from tenants in both cooperative and
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
privately owned manufactured housing
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
community it was also an opportunity for
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
members of the board to freely exchange
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
views with each other
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
members of industry and residence
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
members of the then existing tenants
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
association called Moda who served on
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
the board had an opportunity to come
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
together with legislative members to
 
00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
those having to do with the case at hand
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
and other matters just affecting the
 
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.130 align:start position:0%
and other matters just affecting the
industry

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.140 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:50:36.829 --> 00:50:36.839 align:start position:0%
that's changed quite a bit over the last
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
five years or so
 
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:40.190 align:start position:0%
five years or so
um

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
at our last meeting on March 3rd we had
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
two members in attendance including
 
00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
two members in attendance including
myself

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.370 align:start position:0%
myself
um

00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
I think with this proposal with five
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
members you're going to have some real
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
Quorum issues going down the line you're
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
just not going to get anything done
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
but we haven't really been
 
00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:03.829 align:start position:0%
but we haven't really been
um

00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
you know I've been on the front lines
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
for a long time with this and I'm
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
speaking not
 
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:12.950 align:start position:0%
speaking not
um

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can touch this uh not
 
00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.490 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can touch this uh not
from

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh position of the board itself because
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have a quorum we haven't taken
 
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
a position as a board on this bill so
 
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:27.740 align:start position:0%
I'm seeking just for myself and my own
 
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
I'm seeking just for myself and my own
opinion

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:31.010 align:start position:0%
opinion
um

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
our complaints have fallen off
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
dramatically in the last five years as
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
Miss Reardon testified to part of this
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
is I think
 
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.170 align:start position:0%
is I think
um

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
we have a better educated class of Park
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
owners they know what their obligations
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
are they know what they can do and what
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
what they can't do
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
um judges are more aware of the issues
 
00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
we have mediation now that's a step in
 
00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:00.020 align:start position:0%
the court process
 
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
and residents are more aware of their
 
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
rights and obligations
 
00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:07.010 align:start position:0%
rights and obligations
um

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the three cases that we had
 
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:12.180 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
was dismissed
 
00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.890 align:start position:0%
was dismissed
because

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
the complainant had previously gone to
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
court and lost
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
so you know we're not a board that
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
overrules a Judicial decision so we had
 
00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:27.800 align:start position:0%
to decline
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
that case
 
00:52:30.359 --> 00:52:31.849 align:start position:0%
that case
um

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:35.099 align:start position:0%
there's one case pending now
 
00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
and we've subsequently learned that that
 
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:41.700 align:start position:0%
person decided that while her complaint
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
was pending she went to small claims
 
00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:48.660 align:start position:0%
court on the same issues and lost
 
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
so we just haven't gotten together to
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
dismiss it because as I say we don't we
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
don't overturn uh judicial decisions and
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
we don't have that Authority uh to do
 
00:53:00.599 --> 00:53:01.910 align:start position:0%
we don't have that Authority uh to do
that

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.710 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
and I I wanted to uh just mention
 
00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:09.020 align:start position:0%
um Moda that was the tenants Association
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
and that hadn't been in operation since
 
00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:14.210 align:start position:0%
and that hadn't been in operation since
2011.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
um I think it's been recently revived
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
only a couple of apart from someone in
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
Moda yeah we'll be talking about it yeah
 
00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
they revived a couple of weeks ago so
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a need now
 
00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:26.770 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a need now
um

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:26.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid that while the board has
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
served an important historical role uh
 
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
it served its purpose
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
um the suggestion that it should be
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
um revived by packing it with
 
00:53:45.650 --> 00:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
um a different membership or reducing to
 
00:53:47.809 --> 00:53:47.819 align:start position:0%
five the membership
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that that's
 
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.210 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that that's
um

00:53:50.210 --> 00:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
it'll work I think it's misdirected uh
 
00:53:57.049 --> 00:53:57.059 align:start position:0%
breathing life into a more Bond board is
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
really not the answer here I do suggest
 
00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:01.260 align:start position:0%
that the answer lies with the Community
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
Loan Fund to solve a problems endemic
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
and cooperatively own parks
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
which is what this bill seeks to have
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
the board do but instead of putting this
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
on the board of manufactured housing and
 
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
on state resources I think it would be
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
far more effective for the Loan Fund to
 
00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:23.240 align:start position:0%
set up and pay for a mediation program
 
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh in these cooperatively owned
 
00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.150 align:start position:0%
uh in these cooperatively owned
communities

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
and arrange for that private meeting
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
similar to what the New Hampshire
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Association does in
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
the case of disputes over rent in
 
00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440 align:start position:0%
privately owned communities
 
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
privately owned communities
um

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
they're required by Statute to
 
00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:48.180 align:start position:0%
advise residents that there is this
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
mediation program available I don't see
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
why the Loan Fund can't do that
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and I also believe I heard reference
 
00:54:59.329 --> 00:54:59.339 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 64 which is making its
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
way through the system to study the
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
issues that are
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
that have Arisen in cooperatively owned
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
communities and I think maybe there will
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
be some answers to come out of that
 
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:20.390 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.210 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me Mr tay but then we do have one
 
00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
my question is uh we heard something
 
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.109 align:start position:0%
my question is uh we heard something
about

00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:40.250 align:start position:0%
about
um

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
if you're a resident of a park and and
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's a movement to form one of these
 
00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:49.980 align:start position:0%
rocks I guess you call them that uh
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
that a minority of the homeowners
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
can make that decision for a majority
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that do you know about
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
that there was some legislation that
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
passed last year and I have to refresh
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
myself but in the past yes
 
00:56:08.329 --> 00:56:08.339 align:start position:0%
um it was the number of people attending
 
00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
a meeting and that out of that number a
 
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
majority and so that was where
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
um you know a very small majority of the
 
00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:20.220 align:start position:0%
residents would vote in favor and then
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
it would happen I think that's like a
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
sound meeting right who shows up has the
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
power yeah that's right and I think that
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's been some legislation I don't
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
know that it fully addresses uh the
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
issues frankly I I'm not keeping up with
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
that legislation so I don't know I'm
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
just generally aware that it was
 
00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that changed that was very
 
00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you very much you're
 
00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:44.220 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you Mr Tay
 
00:56:47.809 --> 00:56:47.819 align:start position:0%

00:56:47.819 --> 00:56:52.549 align:start position:0%
representative Olney sorry about that
sorry

00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
is the one that we brought in to talk
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
about our condominium problems
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
about 10 years ago
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
you had retired and you came back
 
00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:08.059 align:start position:0%
no no that's that's retired me
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
sorry uh Susan lme on representative
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon on and
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clear up just a couple of
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
things I've had a number of things
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
cleared up for me as I've been sitting
 
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
here listening on if
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
you were the Commerce Committee you'd
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
know quite a lot about this
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure why we got this built I
 
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
think would be more appropriate in
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
Commerce but yes go on but
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
um they this I know something about this
 
00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
issue though I've been filling in a lot
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
of recent blanks as I've been listening
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
because uh the Condominiums and
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations have the same
 
00:57:58.490 --> 00:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
problems of on citizens with no help
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
from outside except for the ones that
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
are served by rocks on
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
being able and the ones that go to have
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
gone to the manufactured housing board
 
00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.750 align:start position:0%
gone to the manufactured housing board
on

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
being able to figure out how to govern
 
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and run small towns
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
governments all by themselves with
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
without anybody to help and I've been
 
00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:29.700 align:start position:0%
working on that for quite a while on the
 
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.549 align:start position:0%
working on that for quite a while on the
reason

00:58:31.549 --> 00:58:31.559 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
that the manufactured housing board
 
00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:38.180 align:start position:0%
ended up in on
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
oplc is that they had no place else to
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
put it that state didn't want to have to
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
pay for it on 25 even when the 25 was
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
put in doesn't pay for all the expenses
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
of it on and it went to
 
00:58:57.599 --> 00:58:58.849 align:start position:0%
of it on and it went to
um

00:58:58.849 --> 00:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
it was put into the dedicated funds
 
00:59:05.329 --> 00:59:05.339 align:start position:0%
category it was put into a group of of
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
funds on and the rest of them were
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
yet have to usually pay 25 above the
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
cost of of their operation to the state
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
and some of that money went to keep
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
having that going
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
on it's
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
it's served an incredibly important
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
function and I believe that in one way
 
00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
it still does because it's website on
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
has a great deal of information on it
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
for on members and boards that that go
 
00:59:50.569 --> 00:59:50.579 align:start position:0%
to it trying to find out okay this
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
person is saying that I shouldn't be
 
00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:56.839 align:start position:0%
doing this or I should be doing that and
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
and there are the results of the
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
previous cases
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
and as it was explained to us when we
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
started the condominium committee on
 
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.450 align:start position:0%
started the condominium committee on
their

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:10.460 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:14.540 align:start position:0%
the lawyer was on that board
 
01:00:19.309 --> 01:00:19.319 align:start position:0%
specifically to on make sure that all
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
the rulings of the board were put in
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
language that would be acceptable to the
 
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
courts they were filed in the courts and
 
01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
maybe Mr Tay has a different
 
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:31.380 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this than the one that
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
I we received 10 years ago but on
 
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's filed in the courts if after six
 
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
months no one has appealed the verdict
 
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
of the board it gets put into the files
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
of the manufactured housing board and it
 
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:53.700 align:start position:0%
is available on the website for people
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
to look at and say oh gee I guess
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
they've they really do have that right
 
01:00:58.559 --> 01:01:00.049 align:start position:0%
they've they really do have that right
or

01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
they probably don't and if I go to court
 
01:01:05.569 --> 01:01:05.579 align:start position:0%
to try to dispute it I'm just wasting my
 
01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
to try to dispute it I'm just wasting my
money

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
so that's on as we understood it at the
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
time 10 years ago that was why they were
 
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
starting to see less cases
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
because as he said the judges understood
 
01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.230 align:start position:0%
because as he said the judges understood
better

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
what on these bodies are about and had a
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
a body of rulings behind them which they
 
01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:31.740 align:start position:0%
will still have even if you get rid of
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing board
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh frankly I've been trying and the
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
people that have come in and out of the
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
legislature with me I've been trying for
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
some years to
 
01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.170 align:start position:0%
some years to
um

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
get a
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
near copy of the manufactured housing
 
01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
board set up for Condominiums and
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
because they're still without this help
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
but it has been very valuable over the
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
years and I don't think it could have
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
been that way without the lawyer who was
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
the one who held the glue together and
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
the lawyer is being taken out of this
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
one so that's just all I wanted to say
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the history any
 
01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the history any
questions

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:02:22.609 --> 01:02:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:29.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
and I trust after the uh
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
the hour of testimony we've already
 
01:02:38.809 --> 01:02:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.819 --> 01:02:42.170 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
this looked like a very simple build
 
01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
when I first scheduled it I was I was
 
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.609 align:start position:0%
when I first scheduled it I was I was
wrong

01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:51.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.289 --> 01:02:54.299 align:start position:0%
no push the button there you go now
 
01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.210 --> 01:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
I'll try to be as brief I'll cut as much
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
as I can good morning committee members
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
my name is Kim Capon and I'm here on
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
behalf of Moda manufactured homeowners
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
and tenants Association to speak in
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
favor of this legislation
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
I personally live in a manufactured home
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
and I do so because if it's
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
affordability I also do a lot of
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
volunteering in my community as well as
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
around the country in support of
 
01:03:23.569 --> 01:03:23.579 align:start position:0%
Resident owned Community residents and
 
01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
their boards
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
Moda manufactured home antennas
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
Association was started to support the
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners as a place to get relief from
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
unfair practices of Park owners a year
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
or so before the onset of covet several
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the board members vacated their
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
positions and as president has passed
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
away the associate went silent until
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
recently when it was resurrected by
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
several residents and rocks who felt
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
that too often homeowners are victimized
 
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
with no no with no known remedy to them
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
existing I presently serve as president
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
and we have a small board and group of
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers to bring bring back to life
 
01:04:02.809 --> 01:04:02.819 align:start position:0%
the advocacy group and hopefully bring
 
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
back hope for those in manufactured
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
housing who aren't aware of where to
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
turn offering guidance and support to
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
Residents is helpful but when it comes
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
apparent that Resident rights are being
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
violated then folks
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
then folks were referred to the
 
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.700 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board to seek
 
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.730 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing board to seek
relief

01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
relief
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to the appointed
 
01:04:23.630 --> 01:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
members into the jurisdiction of the
 
01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing Housing board are
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
necessary in the interest of fairness to
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
those who would be subject to those
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
boards Authority I feel that we need to
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
talk about eliminating
 
01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
any doubt about this board's legitimate
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
legitimacy based upon who might serve on
 
01:04:37.970 --> 01:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
it and those who will benefit by its
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
existence it cannot look to be
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
self-serving it needs to balance and it
 
01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:44.099 align:start position:0%
needs experience the proposed changes go
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
a long way towards supporting those
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
attributes the plight of all
 
01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
manufactured homeowners is the same in
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
many ways regardless of ownership rocks
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
face many of the same unfair practices
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
that violate rsa's governing
 
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing owners be it the
 
01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
residents boards or investor owners
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
having a separate government body
 
01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
regulating rocks not only appears
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
Prejudice but is a layer of government
 
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
that is unnecessary the same rsas that
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
protect manufactured homeowners and
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
investor owned Parks protect those in
 
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:14.940 align:start position:0%
rocks as well there is an additional
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
layer of laws that protect the rights
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
and regulation regulate the governance
 
01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:20.819 align:start position:0%
of rocks that the manufactured housing
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
bill could easily have oversight
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
with fair and equal representation of
 
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:27.900 align:start position:0%
Park investor owners resident owners I
 
01:05:29.089 --> 01:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
believe this would not only be
 
01:05:31.069 --> 01:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
considered an impartial board but be not
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
subject to criticism as being well
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
self-serving this Board needs to only be
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
fair not only be fair it needs checks
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
and balances to ensure that it maintains
 
01:05:42.049 --> 01:05:42.059 align:start position:0%
fairness term limits will help with this
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
as well I contend that the claims of
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
there being very few complaints as good
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
cause for eliminating the board is very
 
01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
short-sighted that thinking might assume
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
that because of lack of complaints no
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
residents are being violated in roughly
 
01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:56.099 align:start position:0%
500 parks in the state a preserved
 
01:05:58.010 --> 01:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
self-serving board could be a good
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
reason there are a few along with a lack
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
of knowledge of its existence and ease
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
of submitting a complaint for work
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
working residents and is another
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
these are the issues we should be
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
concerned with I talked to many
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
residents and Resident leads across the
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
country as well as in New Hampshire and
 
01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
there are legitimate concerns that motor
 
01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
is determined to address and that stats
 
01:06:19.370 --> 01:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
with residents being aware that there is
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
hope that unfair practices and lack of a
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
healthy environment can be addressed and
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
motives hopeful that the manufactured
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
housing board is a place we can turn to
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
to support our evidence at resolving
 
01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
issues of fairness environment and
 
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:33.650 align:start position:0%
issues of fairness environment and
affordability

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
01:06:35.569 --> 01:06:35.579 align:start position:0%
the changes to the makeup of the members
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
bring bring about balance that is needed
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
both perspectives being honest
 
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
both perspectives being honesty and a
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
balance in charge and discharging
 
01:06:47.109 --> 01:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
discipline fairly it's jurisdiction
 
01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
expansion also prevents another layer of
 
01:06:51.529 --> 01:06:51.539 align:start position:0%
government that is unnecessary as many
 
01:06:51.539 --> 01:06:52.490 align:start position:0%
government that is unnecessary as many
times

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
times
 
01:06:54.529 --> 01:06:54.539 align:start position:0%
there can be a crossover of violations
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
that can be benefic can be dealt with in
 
01:06:59.450 --> 01:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
the same visit for the residents there
 
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
is good work to be done in the support
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
of this committee would be greatly
 
01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:04.069 align:start position:0%
of this committee would be greatly
appreciated

01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
appreciated

Advisory Board this bill removes certain
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
requirements for the terms of members of

01:09:51.530 --> 01:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
by the Senate unfortunately that's all
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%

questions
uh

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:15.179 align:start position:0%
good morning Madam chairman members of
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
the committee I am John Jasper
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
01:10:21.709 --> 01:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food and I am in
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
full support of Senate Bill 146 which
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
was put in at my request
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
um the basics I think have been been
 
01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:33.010 align:start position:0%
um the basics I think have been been
covered

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.020 align:start position:0%
covered
 
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:36.659 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of confusion
 
01:10:39.410 --> 01:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
over what the advisory
 
01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
board is supposed to do and what it does
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
which became very evident in my
 
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.530 align:start position:0%
which became very evident in my
reconfirmation

01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
reconfirmation
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing I have emailed you all a copy of
 
01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
a recent history of of the board and
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
what it actually has been doing since
 
01:10:59.570 --> 01:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
1979 which frankly isn't much except for
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
touring farms in every five years making
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
a recommendation to the governor on who
 
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.209 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
um

01:11:08.209 --> 01:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
should be I am not actually a member of
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
the board although until well you'll see
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
it in there at some point
 
01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.630 align:start position:0%
it in there at some point
um

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
the commissioner did ask act as chair of
 
01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
the board that was uh Duty was taken
 
01:11:27.770 --> 01:11:27.780 align:start position:0%
away many decades ago although it took
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
another 10 or more years before that
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
actually went into practice
 
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.770 align:start position:0%
actually went into practice
um so

01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
yeah I hope you agree with me that laws
 
01:11:41.870 --> 01:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
should not be aspirational they should
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
be functional many of the things that
 
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
are in the current duties of the board
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
turn out to be more aspirational than
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
realistic and that's why I've requested
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
all these things be taken out because
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
they have actually never been done at
 
01:12:00.770 --> 01:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
least in the last uh 44 years
 
01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:01.970 align:start position:0%
least in the last uh 44 years
so

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
um the real function of the board is
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
just to make that recommendation to to
 
01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
the governor that's actually what they
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
have have done they should be doing more
 
01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:14.820 align:start position:0%
in my opinion but it's very hard to get
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
a volunteer group that meets a couple of
 
01:12:20.090 --> 01:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
times a year to actually do any more
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
than just check in they'll be meeting in
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks and they'll be meeting
 
01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
with the division heads to get an update
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
on what's what's going on one of the
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
things that we've asked to be taken out
 
01:12:35.209 --> 01:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
is the term limit because it is
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to actually get
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
members to serve on this committee and
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
get them to show up so when you have a
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
good member uh probably a good idea to
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
keep them there
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
what has been happening although it's
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
the governor's responsibility to
 
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.770 align:start position:0%
the governor's responsibility to
nominate

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
nominate
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the council it's really been the
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner who has been suggesting
 
01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.250 align:start position:0%
commissioner who has been suggesting
that

01:13:01.250 --> 01:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
to the governor and then been moving
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
forward there now there are some of the
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
some of the members we're not suggesting
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
that the membership be changed some of
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
those seats have been vacant for another
 
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
number of while there's supposed to be
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
fuel dealers that's not really something
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm familiar with who to get some
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the wholesalers so those seats are
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
are vacant but I have made it uh clear
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
to the to the board that here on out I
 
01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
am going to expect them to make
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the governor I find
 
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
it to be a bit of a conflict of interest
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the commissioner to actually be
 
01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
making recommendations to the governor
 
01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh for a board that is supposed to
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to the commissioner
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
as it is currently it's pretty much a
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
hand-picked group by the Commissioner of
 
01:13:50.990 --> 01:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and so your hand-picked
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
members are in in fact advising advising
 
01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
the commissioner I don't like that model
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's going to return there I I
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
hope I want to make you aware of the
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
fact that there is a conflict
 
01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
with Senate bill 146.
 
01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
after the confirmation process the
 
01:14:19.209 --> 01:14:19.219 align:start position:0%
governor put in House Bill 2 or require
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
requirement that the board go back to
 
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.250 align:start position:0%
requirement that the board go back to
meeting

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
four times a year as you'll see in the
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
email I I sent you the attachment that
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
never happened even when there was a
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to meet four times
 
01:14:34.130 --> 01:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
a year and so I don't know what anybody
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
can do to make the meat four times a
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
year that's just not realistic they hope
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
to meet three times a year that's their
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
plan one time in Concord and then take
 
01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
their show out on the road if you will
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
and meet in different counties
 
01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.770 align:start position:0%
and meet in different counties
however

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
however
um

01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
um
Pages

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
Pages
 
01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
47 47 48 there's a section that leaves
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
in all of the aspirational goals and um
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
and really conflicts with this so I'm
 
01:15:08.689 --> 01:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
will be asking that the Senate removed
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
that section I did ask that the house
 
01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659 align:start position:0%
removed the whole section instead it got
 
01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
amended and now we have these
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
conflicting pieces of legislation so
 
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
um I'll leave my my remarks there and I
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
will be glad to answer any questions uh
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
that I can
 
01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
Brian has a question thank you madam
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
chair yes my question is uh on the term
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
limits I think in modern times we get a
 
01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
address these issues it is tough to get
 
01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
volunteers to come in and spend the
 
01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
required amount of time but at the end
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
there's a sunset it's the end of year
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
term and if a member is not adequate
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
he may not be reinstated
 
01:15:56.990 --> 01:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
what does your Fail-Safe for an
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
inadequate member currently if there's
 
01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:02.300 align:start position:0%
no Sunset of a term
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
and I don't have the full Statute in
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
front of me but I believe that it is
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
okay and then they are automatically
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
removed no further action is necessary
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
that becomes a a vacant seat
 
01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.790 align:start position:0%
that becomes a a vacant seat
representative

01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh I believe I heard you
 
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
say that your department had requested
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
this legislation is that correct that is
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
correct and I would point out again
 
01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
Madam chair that that's not explained in
 
01:16:39.890 --> 01:16:39.900 align:start position:0%
the analysis that's been a pet Bugaboo
 
01:16:44.689 --> 01:16:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
no problem or some Goldie you had a
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair I just
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
wanted to I have the statute in front of
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
me and it states two unexcused absences
 
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:55.140 align:start position:0%
so that's even better better thank you
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
representative okay

thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%

um I've gotten no complaints from any
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
Farmers about this bill are you aware of
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
any opposition from the farm community
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
to this bill no none whatsoever and and
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
I should have stated that the
 
01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
the agricultural Advisory Board is in in
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
full support of the bill as amended by
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
excellent all right other questions the
 
01:17:28.669 --> 01:17:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey thank you madam
 
01:17:28.679 --> 01:17:29.630 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey thank you madam
chair

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
could could you explain to me why we
 
01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
would you would be asking the
 
01:17:35.570 --> 01:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner to leave the meeting well
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
if you that was actually my suggestion
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
because if you paid any attention to the
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh my re my confirmation process and I
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
hope you didn't
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
you you would have realized what a mean
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
bully I am and that I intimidate
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
everyone everywhere I go
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
and so it seemed that the only way to
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
address that would be if somebody came
 
01:18:03.169 --> 01:18:03.179 align:start position:0%
in and didn't want to speak in front of
 
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
me or future Commissioners
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they'd be allowed to ask for the
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner to excuse him him or
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
herself I think that is reasonable to
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
give people the ability to freely speak
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
their thoughts without having a bully
 
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:20.900 align:start position:0%
such as myself
 
01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
glaring at them
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you commissioner that
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that explanation makes perfect sense
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
are there any uh other questions
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
all right seeing them thank you for your
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to

one of the more simple bills that you

01:21:50.810 --> 01:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill that um
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
comes to you from the Senate with a
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
great recommendation of
 
01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:00.140 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
transparency is essential to trust in
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
government over the course of the
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic the state receives
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
significant funds from the federal
 
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.850 align:start position:0%
significant funds from the federal
government

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:12.860 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
and we're grateful to the federal
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
delegation for securing the needed
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
dollars and to the state for dispersing
 
01:22:20.159 --> 01:22:22.209 align:start position:0%
dollars and to the state for dispersing
them

01:22:22.209 --> 01:22:22.219 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
one thing that remains to be seen is a
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
detailed clear accounting of the funds
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
that have been received from the federal
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
government through various recent
 
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.729 align:start position:0%
government through various recent
actions

01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
actions
 
01:22:37.739 --> 01:22:39.590 align:start position:0%
actions
um

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
as the governor noted in his budget
 
01:22:44.510 --> 01:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
address one of the greatest
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we have is to be good
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
stewards for the taxpayer and ultimately
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
any funding that we receive from the
 
01:22:58.130 --> 01:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
federal government came from the
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and those same taxpayers
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
deserve transparency and clarity about
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
where those dollars go
 
01:23:09.410 --> 01:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh currently the data that is reported
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
and shared publicly is very limited in
 
01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
scope and uh with little detailed
 
01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
information it's very dense
 
01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know for example the
 
01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:22.370 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know for example the
current

01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
um current reports speak to the funds
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
that have been accepted and to what
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
programs they uh go but not exactly what
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
has been spent or who to whom the then
 
01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:38.460 align:start position:0%
uh the who the vendors are
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
um So to that end I bring before you SB
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
208 208 requires the commissioner of the
 
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:47.900 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office for emergency
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
relief and Recovery otherwise known as
 
01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
gopher to separately report on the
 
01:23:58.250 --> 01:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
disbursement of federal funds beginning
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
in July of 2023 the department will
 
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
those both of those departments will
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
create and make available on their
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
public websites reports of all federal
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
relief relief funds disbursed within 30
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
days of each disbursement it should be
 
01:24:20.630 --> 01:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
in check register format and include the
 
01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:22.980 align:start position:0%

01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
whom the disbursement was made as well
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
as the accounting unit and class code of
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
the disbursement the title and number of
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
the expense account and a brief
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
description of each disbursement
 
01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.330 align:start position:0%
description of each disbursement
um

01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
I think that we are all well aware that
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh folks are grateful for the money that
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
has come in and they're glad that it is
 
01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
being spent but I know that all of us
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
wants to understand uh well where it is
 
01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.410 align:start position:0%
wants to understand uh well where it is
going

01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I think that we also agree that
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability and the
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
spending of taxpayer dollars is
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
supremely important and you know I I ask
 
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
your committee to um
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
also look favorably favorably upon this
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
bill and pass it and I'm happy to take
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I have a question is
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
go for a continuing committee or just a
 
01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
a covid emergency it is continuing if it
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
is continuing interesting I'm not sure
 
01:25:29.209 --> 01:25:29.219 align:start position:0%
that it has been meeting regularly but
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
it does still exist and they still have
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
their website
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you uh the questions
 
01:25:36.890 --> 01:25:36.900 align:start position:0%
representative your heart thank you
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
madam chair what is the violation of not
 
01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
fulfilling oh that's a great question
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for asking
 
01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
um because the bill itself refers to
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
um the right to know Ombudsman and I
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
think that is so what we're trying to do
 
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
here is really make this public make it
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
well known and for people to also we the
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
fact that we have this Ombudsman Now is
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
really important and I think this
 
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
putting that in the bill here allows
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
people to know that if they have a
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
grievance they go to the Ombudsman and
 
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
um the Ombudsman should work to resolve
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
that complaint and um I think that's an
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
important uh it is important for our
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
state that we have that person in that
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
position uh that will oversee this or
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily oversee it but respond
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
to any complaint all right follow up
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
follow up so the Ombudsman right now if
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
I was to actually Ombudsman for this
 
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:33.780 align:start position:0%
information Nation I would not be able
 
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
to get it
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
yes you wouldn't it doesn't
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
right now we don't necessarily have it
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
in this format now so just formatting I
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
got you thank you okay yes
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%

um so if I understand correctly gopher
 
01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
is currently making reports but
 
01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:56.709 align:start position:0%
is currently making reports but
um

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:56.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.629 --> 01:26:59.639 align:start position:0%
the dos the department of administrative
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
Services is not oh yeah they have
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
reports yes okay but it doesn't specify
 
01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.129 align:start position:0%
reports yes okay but it doesn't specify
vendors

01:27:07.129 --> 01:27:07.139 align:start position:0%
vendors
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
not for these federal funds it doesn't I
 
01:27:13.850 --> 01:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
believe it's just a general we spend so
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
much at this vendor it doesn't say this
 
01:27:19.090 --> 01:27:19.100 align:start position:0%
was from federal funds ah okay
 
01:27:22.669 --> 01:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
distinction okay thank you thank you yes
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the checkbook and it is
 
01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:27.300 align:start position:0%
incredibly dense
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%

01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right then I'll close the public
 
01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:46.310 align:start position:0%
all right then I'll close the public
hearing

01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay does someone have a motion on this
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
bill I'll make a motion um Madam chair
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
of OTP and House Bill 208 is there a
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
second Senate Bill 208
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
okay second is by representative Simon
 
01:28:03.590 --> 01:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
versus Broder do you wish to speak on
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
your motion yes thank you I think it's
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
important to provide transparency when
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
it comes to
 
01:28:11.090 --> 01:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
um this these funding sources and having
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
it available from two um two different
 
01:28:17.570 --> 01:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
offices I think is helpful for that
 
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:25.020 align:start position:0%

committee members
 
02:57:23.690 --> 02:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
um before you is Senate Bill 49 I'm by
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
the way I'm Senator Tim Lang uh uh uh
 
02:57:29.210 --> 02:57:29.220 align:start position:0%
senator for District Two having served
 
02:57:31.130 --> 02:57:31.140 align:start position:0%
three terms in this August body over
 
02:57:32.510 --> 02:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
here I finally made it over to the
 
02:57:33.830 --> 02:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
Senate where they tell me the adults
 
02:57:35.809 --> 02:57:35.819 align:start position:0%
live I'm still waiting to see that but
 
02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
02:57:40.790 --> 02:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so Senate Bill 49's in front of you
 
02:57:42.710 --> 02:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
um this bill came out of a study
 
02:57:45.530 --> 02:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee that your chairman and I were
 
02:57:47.330 --> 02:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
on along with Senator Carson to look at
 
02:57:49.370 --> 02:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
the oplc and the way they deal with
 
02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:50.809 align:start position:0%
the oplc and the way they deal with
things

02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:57:53.690 --> 02:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
um the reason for this bill is that each
 
02:57:53.700 --> 02:57:54.550 align:start position:0%
um the reason for this bill is that each
year

02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:57:57.290 --> 02:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
oplc through collecting fees and
 
02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
licenses end up turning over lapses in
 
02:58:03.050 --> 02:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
Revenue after taking care of their
 
02:58:05.030 --> 02:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
expenses to
 
02:58:08.450 --> 02:58:08.460 align:start position:0%
um the general fund and if you
 
02:58:10.250 --> 02:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
understand I'm sure this board does the
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
oplc that that 125 percent rule that the
 
02:58:15.170 --> 02:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
cost of a license shouldn't exceed 125
 
02:58:16.790 --> 02:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the cost to administer the license
 
02:58:19.010 --> 02:58:19.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's considered the tax the
 
02:58:20.630 --> 02:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
problem is we're taxing because we have
 
02:58:22.130 --> 02:58:22.140 align:start position:0%
monies left over that we just throw to
 
02:58:23.330 --> 02:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
the general fund and use for other
 
02:58:25.610 --> 02:58:25.620 align:start position:0%
purposes other than for the licensees
 
02:58:27.650 --> 02:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
and the boards so the purpose of this
 
02:58:29.510 --> 02:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill is to fix that problem
 
02:58:30.590 --> 02:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm looking through my notes
 
02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
here somewhere I have the amount of
 
02:58:34.849 --> 02:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
money here it is each year the oplc in
 
02:58:38.030 --> 02:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
2019 they've they lapse 3.4 million
 
02:58:40.490 --> 02:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
dollars to the general fund at and again
 
02:58:42.590 --> 02:58:42.600 align:start position:0%
that's from fees and license costs that
 
02:58:44.510 --> 02:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
they've collected from from people
 
02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
working in the uh in this in their
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
Industries and then it wasn't used for
 
02:58:51.050 --> 02:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
those people it was used to supplement
 
02:58:53.690 --> 02:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
the uh the federal the state government
 
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
so in 2019 we lapsed 3.4 million 2020 we
 
02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
elapsed 3.3 million in two in 2021
 
02:59:04.010 --> 02:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
relapsed 4.1 million and in 22 it's
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
estimated we're going to lapse about 2.6
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
million so what this bill does is
 
02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
creates a non-lapsing fund
 
02:59:13.730 --> 02:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
and instead of the these monies being
 
02:59:15.170 --> 02:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
lapse of the general fund for general
 
02:59:17.469 --> 02:59:17.479 align:start position:0%
purposes will be lapsed back to a
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund under the uh oplc for
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
them to be able to use it in the future
 
02:59:24.830 --> 02:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
years for either Capital expenditures so
 
02:59:27.170 --> 02:59:27.180 align:start position:0%
again if they need to say we'll use the
 
02:59:28.730 --> 02:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
example of replace the computer system
 
02:59:31.790 --> 02:59:31.800 align:start position:0%
within oplc they would have a fund to
 
02:59:33.290 --> 02:59:33.300 align:start position:0%
draw from from that so it didn't come
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
from General funds and it was paid for
 
02:59:37.010 --> 02:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
by the licensees the people who are
 
02:59:39.769 --> 02:59:39.779 align:start position:0%
paying to run the oplc
 
02:59:41.030 --> 02:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't come from General
 
02:59:43.849 --> 02:59:43.859 align:start position:0%
general fund costs and it would be used
 
02:59:46.670 --> 02:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
to benefit the licensees it could also
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
be used for the the oplc could use it to
 
02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
lower license costs in a future year if
 
02:59:54.230 --> 02:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
they had a large lapse they can turn
 
02:59:56.090 --> 02:59:56.100 align:start position:0%
money back to a board and say reset your
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
licensing fees we or give we're granting
 
02:59:59.630 --> 02:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
you basically five hundred thousand
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
dollars adjust your licensing fees down
 
03:00:03.590 --> 03:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know so you don't have to raise an
 
03:00:05.330 --> 03:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
extra five hundred thousand dollars but
 
03:00:06.769 --> 03:00:06.779 align:start position:0%
they would be able to use this fund to
 
03:00:08.809 --> 03:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
be able to draw for both uh reducing
 
03:00:10.730 --> 03:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
future license costs from the people
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
that are paying it or to use it for
 
03:00:14.570 --> 03:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures there was an
 
03:00:15.950 --> 03:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
amendment in the Senate put in to create
 
03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
a reporting requirement I will say I'm
 
03:00:20.090 --> 03:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
sure again this committee knows it does
 
03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
it deals with oplc bills on a regular
 
03:00:22.020 --> 03:00:22.990 align:start position:0%
it deals with oplc bills on a regular
basis

03:00:22.990 --> 03:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
basis
 
03:00:26.090 --> 03:00:26.100 align:start position:0%
that oplc has changed and the lapse will
 
03:00:29.030 --> 03:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
now happen by Emily by annually instead
 
03:00:32.090 --> 03:00:32.100 align:start position:0%
of uh annually so once every two years
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
they'll submit a lump sum back they'll
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
hold the monies and then return it back
 
03:00:37.490 --> 03:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year and that's what
 
03:00:40.429 --> 03:00:40.439 align:start position:0%
go into fund so we require the Senate
 
03:00:42.410 --> 03:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
Edna added a provision of reporting
 
03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
requirement to let us know where a what
 
03:00:46.849 --> 03:00:46.859 align:start position:0%
they did with the funds so if they moved
 
03:00:48.769 --> 03:00:48.779 align:start position:0%
if they used it for reducing license or
 
03:00:51.650 --> 03:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
costs taking a draw from the fund they
 
03:00:52.969 --> 03:00:52.979 align:start position:0%
would note that if they use it for a
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
capital expenditure I know there's a big
 
03:00:56.830 --> 03:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
push right now for software over there
 
03:00:59.750 --> 03:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
to clean up the licensing process and to
 
03:01:01.790 --> 03:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
allow our citizens a better way of
 
03:01:04.790 --> 03:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
submitting paperwork so
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions but that's
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
it it's just a non-dedicated fund that
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
people who pay the fee will get the
 
03:01:13.929 --> 03:01:13.939 align:start position:0%
benefit of the funds that they paid
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:29.269 --> 03:01:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:01:33.769 --> 03:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Carol McGuire from
 
03:01:38.090 --> 03:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
Merrimack 27 and I'm co-sponsor of this
 
03:01:41.809 --> 03:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
bill which Senator Lang explained
 
03:01:46.130 --> 03:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
and I I'm going to bring you as as soon
 
03:01:48.410 --> 03:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
as I'm free to go upstairs and get the
 
03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:49.370 align:start position:0%
as I'm free to go upstairs and get the
copies

03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
copies
 
03:01:52.250 --> 03:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
an amendment to change the first section
 
03:01:55.370 --> 03:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
of it to the language that the house
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee put into house
 
03:02:02.630 --> 03:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill 445 which is on the same topic this
 
03:02:04.550 --> 03:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
was a case of a study committee where
 
03:02:06.830 --> 03:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
they said we need a bill on
 
03:02:10.309 --> 03:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund and both the senator
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
and a House member
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
went up and did it so we had two bills
 
03:02:17.050 --> 03:02:17.060 align:start position:0%
on the same topic
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
so my plan is to take the language the
 
03:02:24.410 --> 03:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
house Ways and Means worked out on House
 
03:02:26.389 --> 03:02:26.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 445
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
put it into the Senate bill which has
 
03:02:31.730 --> 03:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement that is not in
 
03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:33.290 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirement that is not in
445

03:02:33.290 --> 03:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
445
 
03:02:35.510 --> 03:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
and send
 
03:02:38.750 --> 03:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
it to Ways and Means again to look at
 
03:02:41.389 --> 03:02:41.399 align:start position:0%
that section and then return it to the
 
03:02:45.230 --> 03:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
Senate uh I've discussed this with
 
03:02:48.170 --> 03:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
Senator pearl of Senate Edna and he
 
03:02:50.210 --> 03:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
thinks that's the best way to handle it
 
03:02:53.630 --> 03:02:53.640 align:start position:0%
because by the time he has to deal with
 
03:02:57.410 --> 03:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
the changes we make it will be we'll
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
know what's happening in Senate Bill 655
 
03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:02.700 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 2 and a few other
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
uh areas that might affect it so we will
 
03:03:07.929 --> 03:03:07.939 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
get the final language correct
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
so that's my plan I think
 
03:03:18.050 --> 03:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
one reason that I'm in strong support of
 
03:03:23.269 --> 03:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
this is that the license fees are fees
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
and therefore they should be used only
 
03:03:29.929 --> 03:03:29.939 align:start position:0%
to for to provide benefits to the people
 
03:03:32.929 --> 03:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
who pay the fees by allowing significant
 
03:03:35.450 --> 03:03:35.460 align:start position:0%
amount of money to lapse to the general
 
03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:36.650 align:start position:0%
amount of money to lapse to the general
fund

03:03:36.650 --> 03:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're creating it attacks and it is an
 
03:03:43.730 --> 03:03:43.740 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional tax because it is
 
03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
not evenly distributed is not
 
03:03:48.530 --> 03:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
proportional some of the license fees
 
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
are much higher than the other and
 
03:03:54.230 --> 03:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why the license fees
 
03:03:56.450 --> 03:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
should support the manufactured housing
 
03:04:00.110 --> 03:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
board for example or be lapsed to the
 
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
for a general administration of the
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
state there to cover the cost of issuing
 
03:04:09.650 --> 03:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
the licenses the cost of discipline and
 
03:04:09.660 --> 03:04:11.710 align:start position:0%
the licenses the cost of discipline and
investigations

03:04:11.710 --> 03:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
03:04:15.950 --> 03:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
and the other actions of the oplc
 
03:04:19.490 --> 03:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that we should be able to
 
03:04:22.429 --> 03:04:22.439 align:start position:0%
create a debt by creating a dedicated
 
03:04:22.439 --> 03:04:23.690 align:start position:0%
create a debt by creating a dedicated
fund

03:04:23.690 --> 03:04:23.700 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:04:26.269 --> 03:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
we will be able to lower license fees to
 
03:04:28.429 --> 03:04:28.439 align:start position:0%
only what is necessary
 
03:04:30.830 --> 03:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll answer questions if I can
 
03:04:34.370 --> 03:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:04:39.170 --> 03:04:39.180 align:start position:0%
being here today representative
 
03:04:42.590 --> 03:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
um so is it not also the case that that
 
03:04:47.230 --> 03:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
keeping the funds in the oplc's
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
budget will enable them to administer
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
their uh their boards and more
 
03:04:56.210 --> 03:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
effectively because it's not a steady
 
03:04:59.929 --> 03:04:59.939 align:start position:0%
state of costs it's go the costs go up
 
03:05:03.469 --> 03:05:03.479 align:start position:0%
and down depending on what happens yes
 
03:05:06.170 --> 03:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
that's true thank you
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:05:11.090 --> 03:05:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Brian
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um Madam chair
 
03:05:18.490 --> 03:05:18.500 align:start position:0%
um one of the things the senator uh
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
testified to that money can be reapplied
 
03:05:24.429 --> 03:05:24.439 align:start position:0%
back to lower the licensing fee fees
 
03:05:27.170 --> 03:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
admirable but those of us that have
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
worked on Municipal budgets I don't
 
03:05:31.910 --> 03:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
think anybody wants to see a budget end
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
up like a roller coaster
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
you know so when you charge a fee isn't
 
03:05:40.010 --> 03:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
it better to keep it level funded at
 
03:05:42.050 --> 03:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
that particular rate and try to find out
 
03:05:44.269 --> 03:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
maybe a worth more better worthwhile
 
03:05:48.650 --> 03:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
cause it is an Overstock of money uh
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's one reason why the fees are so
 
03:05:55.190 --> 03:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
resistant to change but there are boards
 
03:05:58.730 --> 03:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.790 --> 03:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
over fund themselves the board of
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
accountancy for example
 
03:06:06.530 --> 03:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
they don't have too many complaints the
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
board of midwives on the other hand has
 
03:06:10.610 --> 03:06:10.620 align:start position:0%
a relatively high percentage of
 
03:06:12.410 --> 03:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
complaints so they're somewhat
 
03:06:15.230 --> 03:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
underfunded the Board of barbering I
 
03:06:17.450 --> 03:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
understand has chosen to keep its fees
 
03:06:20.450 --> 03:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
very low and therefore does not fully
 
03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
cover its costs
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
so there's got to be some adjustments
 
03:06:26.929 --> 03:06:26.939 align:start position:0%
because some boards pay too much and
 
03:06:29.809 --> 03:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
some pay too little and if it turned out
 
03:06:32.690 --> 03:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
there's more of the former than the
 
03:06:34.429 --> 03:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
latter than you know
 
03:06:37.070 --> 03:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
it may be a change but I'm sure they
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
will not object if their fees go down as
 
03:06:44.510 --> 03:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:46.849 --> 03:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative all right I
 
03:06:52.910 --> 03:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:59.710 --> 03:06:59.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:03.230 --> 03:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elmy city of
 
03:07:03.240 --> 03:07:04.849 align:start position:0%
thank you representative elmy city of
Lebanon

03:07:04.849 --> 03:07:04.859 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
03:07:04.859 --> 03:07:06.290 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
um

03:07:06.290 --> 03:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:09.889 --> 03:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
this bill the chair chair woman just
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
told me that a little while ago that it
 
03:07:15.410 --> 03:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
is an early bill which means it comes
 
03:07:17.690 --> 03:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
back to us again afterwards unless you
 
03:07:21.050 --> 03:07:21.060 align:start position:0%
kill it on and
 
03:07:25.130 --> 03:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to include what on the
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
reasons for what we did in our committee
 
03:07:30.070 --> 03:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
in ways and means
 
03:07:33.950 --> 03:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
which um was started by representative
 
03:07:37.550 --> 03:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
ulery and then we went back and forth on
 
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
it and came up with the cap of three
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars on the amount that oplc
 
03:07:51.290 --> 03:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
could on use could keep at the end of
 
03:07:53.290 --> 03:07:53.300 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
03:07:58.370 --> 03:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
what they told us was that the capital
 
03:08:02.929 --> 03:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
expenses would include the software
 
03:08:06.050 --> 03:08:06.060 align:start position:0%
and possibly saving up for a new
 
03:08:06.060 --> 03:08:08.150 align:start position:0%
and possibly saving up for a new
building

03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:08:11.150 --> 03:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
um reps and rollery in particular was
 
03:08:13.690 --> 03:08:13.700 align:start position:0%
and the committee were feeling that
 
03:08:16.849 --> 03:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
decisions on a new building depend
 
03:08:20.210 --> 03:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
should be made more by Das
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
on in and figuring out whether perhaps
 
03:08:27.110 --> 03:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
they could be fit into the same building
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the AG's office or something like
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
that on
 
03:08:32.399 --> 03:08:34.309 align:start position:0%
that on
and

03:08:34.309 --> 03:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:08:37.790 --> 03:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
they told she also told us that they are
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
negotiating with a firm for the new
 
03:08:44.170 --> 03:08:44.180 align:start position:0%
software which is probably going to be
 
03:08:47.389 --> 03:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
based on an annual subscription which is
 
03:08:49.610 --> 03:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
the way most software is going these
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
days rather than on rather than buying
 
03:08:59.030 --> 03:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
outright and three million dollars is
 
03:09:01.130 --> 03:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
about as much as they thought it might
 
03:09:04.690 --> 03:09:04.700 align:start position:0%
cost if they had to buy it outright
 
03:09:08.809 --> 03:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
for during a biennium during the
 
03:09:10.849 --> 03:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
beginning of a biennium actually because
 
03:09:13.010 --> 03:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
they would have more money
 
03:09:16.130 --> 03:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
later in the biennium that they would
 
03:09:18.769 --> 03:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
have saved up unless they get the fees
 
03:09:18.779 --> 03:09:20.450 align:start position:0%
have saved up unless they get the fees
down

03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
down
 
03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:21.290 align:start position:0%
down
um

03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:24.769 --> 03:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
I do know several people that uh
 
03:09:29.389 --> 03:09:29.399 align:start position:0%
in Realtors and and other uh professions
 
03:09:31.849 --> 03:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
that feel like their fees are too high
 
03:09:31.859 --> 03:09:33.950 align:start position:0%
that feel like their fees are too high
and

03:09:33.950 --> 03:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:09:37.670 --> 03:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
and would be quite willing to see them
 
03:09:39.950 --> 03:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
go down a bit again
 
03:09:39.960 --> 03:09:41.410 align:start position:0%
go down a bit again
but

03:09:41.410 --> 03:09:41.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:09:44.809 --> 03:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
lplc is still very much a work in
 
03:09:44.819 --> 03:09:46.250 align:start position:0%
lplc is still very much a work in
progress

03:09:46.250 --> 03:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
progress
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's been making progress which is a lot
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
better than where we were a few years
 
03:09:50.760 --> 03:09:51.710 align:start position:0%
better than where we were a few years
ago

03:09:51.710 --> 03:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:09:55.429 --> 03:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
but it's a work in progress and we don't
 
03:09:57.769 --> 03:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
know where all of these bits and pieces
 
03:10:01.130 --> 03:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
are likely to end up including the one
 
03:10:03.290 --> 03:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
03:10:03.300 --> 03:10:04.969 align:start position:0%
earlier today
and

03:10:04.969 --> 03:10:04.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:04.979 --> 03:10:06.110 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
I did also want to
 
03:10:13.670 --> 03:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
so so we recommended uh
 
03:10:16.969 --> 03:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
and that was passed by the house on the
 
03:10:20.269 --> 03:10:20.279 align:start position:0%
consent calendar two weeks ago and we
 
03:10:22.969 --> 03:10:22.979 align:start position:0%
recommended a three million dollar cap
 
03:10:22.979 --> 03:10:24.469 align:start position:0%
recommended a three million dollar cap
on

03:10:24.469 --> 03:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh how much they could retain
 
03:10:30.469 --> 03:10:30.479 align:start position:0%
and in the next couple of years figuring
 
03:10:32.210 --> 03:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
out how much
 
03:10:35.389 --> 03:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
on they really do need in getting that
 
03:10:38.929 --> 03:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
on an even Keel would allow taking off
 
03:10:40.130 --> 03:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
that cap
 
03:10:43.550 --> 03:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
I think if necessary
 
03:10:43.560 --> 03:10:44.929 align:start position:0%
I think if necessary
but

03:10:44.929 --> 03:10:44.939 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:44.939 --> 03:10:46.610 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:10:46.610 --> 03:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:50.030 --> 03:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
the other part on the new bill the one
 
03:10:53.269 --> 03:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
from Senate on
 
03:10:56.830 --> 03:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
from an amendment in the Senate with the
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
biennial fund report
 
03:11:02.750 --> 03:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
I do feel that
 
03:11:05.990 --> 03:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
the PLC is already producing an annual
 
03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:07.490 align:start position:0%
the PLC is already producing an annual
report

03:11:07.490 --> 03:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:11:07.500 --> 03:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
report
and

03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:12.650 --> 03:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
they are also providing a financial
 
03:11:17.330 --> 03:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
report to the dedicated funds compendium
 
03:11:20.210 --> 03:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
that comes out every year
 
03:11:20.220 --> 03:11:22.550 align:start position:0%
that comes out every year
and

03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:26.450 --> 03:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
this could be very useful but I think
 
03:11:28.969 --> 03:11:28.979 align:start position:0%
that it needs more detail
 
03:11:31.490 --> 03:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
and I was talking to the chair about
 
03:11:31.500 --> 03:11:32.570 align:start position:0%
and I was talking to the chair about
this

03:11:32.570 --> 03:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
after uh she called lunch
 
03:11:39.950 --> 03:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
and she said that well you can do that
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
in ways and means you take care of
 
03:11:43.370 --> 03:11:43.380 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:11:47.690 --> 03:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
we could but if you have any good ideas
 
03:11:50.809 --> 03:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
about what kinds of things we would want
 
03:11:52.429 --> 03:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
in such a report that would not be
 
03:11:54.349 --> 03:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the two that already
 
03:11:59.150 --> 03:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.730 --> 03:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
or maybe decide that they are going to
 
03:12:04.130 --> 03:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
be duplicative and we don't need this
 
03:12:04.140 --> 03:12:05.690 align:start position:0%
be duplicative and we don't need this
but

03:12:05.690 --> 03:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:08.030 --> 03:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:10.250 --> 03:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:12:13.190 --> 03:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
um questions representative Schmidt
 
03:12:16.070 --> 03:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh representative
 
03:12:18.769 --> 03:12:18.779 align:start position:0%
is it uh I realize you're not on the
 
03:12:21.469 --> 03:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
finance committee but the oplc budget
 
03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
would still be under the the uh the
 
03:12:26.929 --> 03:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
governor's purview with regard to the
 
03:12:29.809 --> 03:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
budget it would not be their money to do
 
03:12:32.690 --> 03:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
with as they see fit over and above
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
their operating costs isn't that correct
 
03:12:36.769 --> 03:12:36.779 align:start position:0%
it would their oversight would be
 
03:12:40.610 --> 03:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
budgetary controlled by the house yes we
 
03:12:43.370 --> 03:12:43.380 align:start position:0%
actually were unsure when we discussed
 
03:12:46.010 --> 03:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
this in committee as to whether they
 
03:12:48.170 --> 03:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
would be required to go through the
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
building uh
 
03:12:54.710 --> 03:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
and Public Works sections anyway
 
03:12:57.650 --> 03:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.710 --> 03:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.469 --> 03:13:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:13:18.170 --> 03:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Lindsay
 
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
Courtney executive director of plc
 
03:13:23.450 --> 03:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of Senate
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 and I wish to thank Center Lang
 
03:13:27.950 --> 03:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
as mentioned this is very similar to
 
03:13:32.929 --> 03:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
another bill this committee heard that
 
03:13:35.090 --> 03:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
was sponsored by representative ulery so
 
03:13:37.130 --> 03:13:37.140 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat all of the
 
03:13:39.769 --> 03:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
comments that you heard earlier today as
 
03:13:41.809 --> 03:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
well as in my testimony before you uh
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
for that bill but I just want to
 
03:13:46.190 --> 03:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
highlight briefly how we got here which
 
03:13:47.929 --> 03:13:47.939 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:13:50.809 --> 03:13:50.819 align:start position:0%
um the boards had all previously had
 
03:13:53.090 --> 03:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
their own statutory authority to set
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
fees about half of those fees were
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
actually statutory which created kind of
 
03:14:01.730 --> 03:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
an issue in terms of inconsistent
 
03:14:05.090 --> 03:14:05.100 align:start position:0%
Revenue some boards because of their
 
03:14:07.670 --> 03:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
statutory fees we're bringing in way
 
03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
more Revenue than when compared with
 
03:14:12.710 --> 03:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
their expenditures some other boards
 
03:14:14.510 --> 03:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
we're not bringing in enough
 
03:14:17.809 --> 03:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
at some point in 2015 oplc was granted
 
03:14:20.030 --> 03:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to set fees but
 
03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
because of statutory conflicts we have
 
03:14:26.450 --> 03:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
not been able to make any changes and
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I think as of right now are finally
 
03:14:32.330 --> 03:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
in a position to be able to respond to
 
03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
um those necessary changes so
 
03:14:39.650 --> 03:14:39.660 align:start position:0%
what we plan on doing is on July 1
 
03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
instituting a new allocation method that
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
would allow us to better track staff
 
03:14:45.960 --> 03:14:47.170 align:start position:0%
would allow us to better track staff
time

03:14:47.170 --> 03:14:47.180 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
the the cute the significant portion of
 
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
our operating expenses are for personnel
 
03:14:56.210 --> 03:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
or Personnel related costs so we we do
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
plan to do that for a certain period of
 
03:15:02.809 --> 03:15:02.819 align:start position:0%
time in order to capture really oplc's
 
03:15:05.809 --> 03:15:05.819 align:start position:0%
full expenditures and the allocation to
 
03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
different boards we would need to wait a
 
03:15:10.849 --> 03:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
full biennium but we believe that some
 
03:15:12.469 --> 03:15:12.479 align:start position:0%
modifications might need to be made
 
03:15:14.929 --> 03:15:14.939 align:start position:0%
earlier than waiting a full biennium so
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
we will likely make adjustments sometime
 
03:15:19.190 --> 03:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the fall or propose adjustments based
 
03:15:23.269 --> 03:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
on our review with that data and I think
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
um I think what that is going to do is
 
03:15:26.750 --> 03:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully level set our Revenue stream
 
03:15:29.990 --> 03:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
and our fees as representative McGuire
 
03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:31.670 align:start position:0%
and our fees as representative McGuire
mentioned

03:15:31.670 --> 03:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:15:33.889 --> 03:15:33.899 align:start position:0%
some words are paying significantly more
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
than they should and it's an
 
03:15:37.309 --> 03:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
unconstitution unconstitutional tax and
 
03:15:38.570 --> 03:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
some boards are not covering their
 
03:15:41.690 --> 03:15:41.700 align:start position:0%
expenses at all and then they need to do
 
03:15:44.090 --> 03:15:44.100 align:start position:0%
that so there so we do plan on making
 
03:15:47.450 --> 03:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
those changes in in the future
 
03:15:49.070 --> 03:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
um but really what this bill would do is
 
03:15:51.710 --> 03:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that we are not our licensee
 
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
dollars are being utilized for licensing
 
03:15:53.760 --> 03:15:54.769 align:start position:0%
dollars are being utilized for licensing
purposes

03:15:54.769 --> 03:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
03:15:57.650 --> 03:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
and that's a position that we obviously
 
03:16:00.410 --> 03:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
fully support there are two Capital
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
expenditures that representative almi
 
03:16:04.490 --> 03:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned that we testified
 
03:16:08.090 --> 03:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
regarding um before Ways and Means
 
03:16:09.469 --> 03:16:09.479 align:start position:0%
um on the house bill
 
03:16:12.349 --> 03:16:12.359 align:start position:0%
and the first has to do with software uh
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
oplc has always had funding but we've
 
03:16:17.990 --> 03:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
not been re we have not been fully
 
03:16:19.730 --> 03:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
resourced in the sense that we have not
 
03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
had sufficient in my opinion
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
Appropriations since its Inception in
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
order to do the job that we need to do
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
and serve our constituents so we are
 
03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
starting to make those expenditures and
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
really put licensee dollars back into
 
03:16:36.110 --> 03:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
supporting licensees which has
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
significantly positively impacted
 
03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:40.730 align:start position:0%
significantly positively impacted
Workforce

03:16:40.730 --> 03:16:40.740 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
03:16:43.010 --> 03:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
um so there are two Capital expenditures
 
03:16:46.190 --> 03:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
that we would likely need to have money
 
03:16:47.929 --> 03:16:47.939 align:start position:0%
in the bank for so to speak and the
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
first is software improvements because
 
03:16:51.349 --> 03:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
as we
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
um are encountering Workforce challenges
 
03:16:55.190 --> 03:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state the oplc is also
 
03:16:57.410 --> 03:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
encountering those problems and so we'd
 
03:16:59.809 --> 03:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
like to leverage technology and maybe
 
03:17:01.790 --> 03:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
reduce our
 
03:17:04.969 --> 03:17:04.979 align:start position:0%
um our Reliance on
 
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
um a sizable Personnel
 
03:17:09.170 --> 03:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
um as we move forward and the second
 
03:17:11.389 --> 03:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
which I wasn't prepared to address today
 
03:17:14.450 --> 03:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
but I will briefly mention is for
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
purposes of a building
 
03:17:20.570 --> 03:17:20.580 align:start position:0%
um many of you may recall but we were
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
forced to relocate from Phil Brook which
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
was a state-owned building we paid
 
03:17:26.870 --> 03:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
approximately two hundred thousand
 
03:17:29.809 --> 03:17:29.819 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for that lease to das
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
and we're forced to lease a space in
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
about a period of 30 days and we are now
 
03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:38.210 align:start position:0%
about a period of 30 days and we are now
paying

03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
paying
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
um about eight hundred thousand dollars
 
03:17:41.450 --> 03:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:17:44.510 --> 03:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
and that's a significant sum of money
 
03:17:47.690 --> 03:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
that our licensees are now forced to pay
 
03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
03:17:51.410 --> 03:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
we would love to go into a state-owned
 
03:17:54.230 --> 03:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
space but my concern if there were such
 
03:17:55.730 --> 03:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
a space is that because we are
 
03:17:58.429 --> 03:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
self-funded when things are going well
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
in the state we would we would go into a
 
03:18:01.849 --> 03:18:01.859 align:start position:0%
state-owned space and then when other
 
03:18:03.769 --> 03:18:03.779 align:start position:0%
General funded agencies need our space
 
03:18:05.809 --> 03:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
we would be kicked back out again
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that the move the
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
transition from Phil Brook to seven
 
03:18:13.910 --> 03:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
Eagle Square although I love the space
 
03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
um it really impacted agency operations
 
03:18:18.849 --> 03:18:18.859 align:start position:0%
and we'd like to not have to do that
 
03:18:21.590 --> 03:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're not at a point to be able to make
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
an a
 
03:18:26.090 --> 03:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
suggestions or asks of the legislature
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
but there are other state agencies
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
including the Lottery Commission that
 
03:18:30.650 --> 03:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
have taken a different approach and we
 
03:18:33.590 --> 03:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
are exploring that but that's kind of in
 
03:18:35.150 --> 03:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
the future
 
03:18:37.010 --> 03:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
so in any event happy to answer any
 
03:18:38.750 --> 03:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
questions we think this is a reasonable
 
03:18:41.269 --> 03:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
approach and are happy to comply with
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of reporting obligations the
 
03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
legislature would like us to do
 
03:18:48.050 --> 03:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
um and and we'll get the funding squared
 
03:18:50.750 --> 03:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
away in the next couple of years
 
03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative goalie
 
03:18:55.849 --> 03:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:18:58.190 --> 03:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
first I'll say um
 
03:19:02.510 --> 03:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
shocked to hear how much we're paying a
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
year for a building because
 
03:19:06.349 --> 03:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
sitting on the study committee this
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
summer when the discussion was about
 
03:19:12.830 --> 03:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
the leasing of the space a lot of the
 
03:19:14.330 --> 03:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
trades folks looked at me and said for
 
03:19:16.130 --> 03:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
that price they could have built one
 
03:19:17.830 --> 03:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
hell of a building
 
03:19:20.450 --> 03:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that's our opinion too but not in
 
03:19:24.170 --> 03:19:24.180 align:start position:0%
30 days so uh we don't want to be paying
 
03:19:26.330 --> 03:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
that much for space which is why we're
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be proactive at looking
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
at What other state agencies have done
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Lottery Commission was able to seek
 
03:19:34.130 --> 03:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and they were able
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
to purchase a building for three million
 
03:19:35.760 --> 03:19:36.950 align:start position:0%
to purchase a building for three million
dollars

03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:19:38.510 --> 03:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
um that was a different Market a few
 
03:19:40.610 --> 03:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
years ago but I think that the state
 
03:19:42.790 --> 03:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
could make an investment and we could
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know eliminate that
 
03:19:49.010 --> 03:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
um that line item and represented cost
 
03:19:51.290 --> 03:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
savings my concern with that is without
 
03:19:53.929 --> 03:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority to allow oplc or
 
03:19:55.969 --> 03:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
the boards or however we do it to be
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
able to purchase a building it would
 
03:19:59.630 --> 03:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
have to be under deaths and then as soon
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
as another state agency that's General
 
03:20:02.929 --> 03:20:02.939 align:start position:0%
funded actually needs the space because
 
03:20:04.429 --> 03:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
they're General funded we would be
 
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
forced to relocate again and I think
 
03:20:08.210 --> 03:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
that's why we've seen other self-funded
 
03:20:10.610 --> 03:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
agencies move into lease space or
 
03:20:13.070 --> 03:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
procure their own space outside of that
 
03:20:13.080 --> 03:20:14.990 align:start position:0%
procure their own space outside of that
solution

03:20:14.990 --> 03:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:20:17.210 --> 03:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
although question
 
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
when I look at
 
03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's in front of us and
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
it goes the same with the bill
 
03:20:27.349 --> 03:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
that money's in the fund in excess of
 
03:20:29.330 --> 03:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
three million so at the end of each Bion
 
03:20:32.510 --> 03:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
and be transferred to the general fund
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be stating instead of
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
transferring to the general fund that
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
it shall be used to reassess fees and be
 
03:20:42.650 --> 03:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
used specifically for fees and not back
 
03:20:43.790 --> 03:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
to the general fund because we're going
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
to be back in that same scenario we're
 
03:20:47.809 --> 03:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
in now where any
 
03:20:50.030 --> 03:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
excess fees are going to the state of
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire versus back to what we are
 
03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do is reduce costs for
 
03:20:54.720 --> 03:20:56.090 align:start position:0%
trying to do is reduce costs for
licensees

03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
03:20:57.710 --> 03:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
yeah I would agree with that I mean
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
we're willing to uh support a cap
 
03:21:03.349 --> 03:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
because we think something is better
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
than nothing but I still think a cap
 
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
that has a lapse back to the general
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
fund further creates the same problem
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that we're dealing with and we would
 
03:21:14.750 --> 03:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
support rather than having money go back
 
03:21:16.490 --> 03:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
to licensees because that may be
 
03:21:19.490 --> 03:21:19.500 align:start position:0%
difficult to do having the money be
 
03:21:19.500 --> 03:21:20.690 align:start position:0%
difficult to do having the money be
utilized

03:21:20.690 --> 03:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
03:21:24.110 --> 03:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh in the future biennium to have a you
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
know a reduction in licensing fees in
 
03:21:28.610 --> 03:21:28.620 align:start position:0%
the future that may be the easier
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
easiest approach as opposed to issuing
 
03:21:31.610 --> 03:21:31.620 align:start position:0%
refunds because there's a cost
 
03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.610 --> 03:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
and would you be work
 
03:21:39.769 --> 03:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
03:21:39.779 --> 03:21:40.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Gerard

03:21:40.910 --> 03:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
Gerard
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
how how many employees are you looking
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
how many people do you need to have in
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
office space
 
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
well right now the large majority of our
 
03:21:52.969 --> 03:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
staff are in the office uh the only ones
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
that are not in the office are our
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
inspectors that work remotely
 
03:21:57.840 --> 03:21:58.670 align:start position:0%
inspectors that work remotely
um

03:21:58.670 --> 03:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:00.769 --> 03:22:00.779 align:start position:0%
I think some of our staff could probably
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
work remotely but we are still a young
 
03:22:05.690 --> 03:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
agency we are still developing policies
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
and procedures we're still establishing
 
03:22:09.910 --> 03:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
internal controls so I am not
 
03:22:12.710 --> 03:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable with sending a sizable
 
03:22:14.809 --> 03:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
portion of our stat staff off site at
 
03:22:17.510 --> 03:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
the moment right now we have 126
 
03:22:19.010 --> 03:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
authorized positions and I don't
 
03:22:21.650 --> 03:22:21.660 align:start position:0%
anticipate a need for a significant
 
03:22:24.170 --> 03:22:24.180 align:start position:0%
increase beyond that in fact I think as
 
03:22:26.030 --> 03:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
we continue to leverage technology I
 
03:22:28.010 --> 03:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
think we could see a reduction
 
03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
think we could see a reduction
um

03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:31.730 --> 03:22:31.740 align:start position:0%
in in the number of necessary staff
 
03:22:33.830 --> 03:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
positions through attrition of course
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you follow so how many people are
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
going to the office how many people
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
right now are in the office 120 ish
 
03:22:42.590 --> 03:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
physical yes all right thank you
 
03:22:43.670 --> 03:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:45.710 --> 03:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question as well
 
03:22:47.450 --> 03:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if you can answer this
 
03:22:48.769 --> 03:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
really off the top of your head or not
 
03:22:48.779 --> 03:22:49.849 align:start position:0%
really off the top of your head or not
but

03:22:49.849 --> 03:22:49.859 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
um the boards are able to collect these
 
03:22:56.510 --> 03:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
in 125 of the covering their own costs
 
03:22:59.389 --> 03:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
if all of the boards were to collect 125
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
percent of their operating costs what
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
would the excess be so we've got a three
 
03:23:05.210 --> 03:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
million dollar cap what can that look
 
03:23:05.220 --> 03:23:06.050 align:start position:0%
million dollar cap what can that look
like

03:23:06.050 --> 03:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
like
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
presently right so if our budget is
 
03:23:12.170 --> 03:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
14 million dollars assuming that you
 
03:23:15.590 --> 03:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
know what's 25 above that another three
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
to four million dollars ish um
 
03:23:22.370 --> 03:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
but I will say it's not easy to project
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue at oplc because of the shifts in
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
the market
 
03:23:29.389 --> 03:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
um so for example when things are going
 
03:23:32.389 --> 03:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
well we see a huge flux in the number of
 
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
real estate licensee applications or
 
03:23:37.790 --> 03:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we saw a significant
 
03:23:39.229 --> 03:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
number of Health Care Workforce
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
Healthcare applications so I think three
 
03:23:46.370 --> 03:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars is reasonable just to
 
03:23:47.750 --> 03:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
have as a buffer
 
03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
we start off the biennium with no money
 
03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
no money and
 
03:23:57.410 --> 03:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
um July August September are not huge
 
03:24:00.290 --> 03:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
months for renewals so we are often in
 
03:24:02.570 --> 03:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
the red and thankfully we can pay
 
03:24:05.389 --> 03:24:05.399 align:start position:0%
Personnel costs when we don't have any
 
03:24:09.110 --> 03:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
any funny uh funding
 
03:24:10.910 --> 03:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
um but I think that we're unique in that
 
03:24:13.010 --> 03:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
sense that we don't have any sort of
 
03:24:14.929 --> 03:24:14.939 align:start position:0%
buffer and
 
03:24:17.750 --> 03:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
often trying to play a game of catch-up
 
03:24:23.389 --> 03:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
you know December and June or are
 
03:24:26.630 --> 03:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
um highest months in terms of uh Revenue
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
because of our renewal cycles and so
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
it's just not clear from year to year
 
03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
how much revenue we're going to bring in
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
right so when a board exceeds the 125
 
03:24:40.729 --> 03:24:40.739 align:start position:0%
percent what's the protocol for
 
03:24:42.050 --> 03:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
addressing that because it sounds like
 
03:24:43.849 --> 03:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
it kind of goes on year after year after
 
03:24:45.650 --> 03:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
year without really being appropriately
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
addressed yeah so historically it hasn't
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
been addressed because either the fees
 
03:24:52.130 --> 03:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
were set in statute and we would need to
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
seek a statutory change
 
03:24:56.690 --> 03:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
or because there was a conflict as to
 
03:24:59.809 --> 03:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
who had the authority to set fees and I
 
03:25:02.030 --> 03:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
think that conflict this session has
 
03:25:05.030 --> 03:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
largely been resolved hopefully
 
03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:05.710 align:start position:0%
largely been resolved hopefully
um

03:25:05.710 --> 03:25:05.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:09.950 --> 03:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
but uh but that has been the issue
 
03:25:11.570 --> 03:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you director
 
03:25:16.010 --> 03:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
Stephen raincort
 
03:25:26.990 --> 03:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.849 --> 03:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee and committee
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you my name is Stephen
 
03:25:32.809 --> 03:25:32.819 align:start position:0%
Rancourt I'm a licensed electrician
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
under the oplc and also the executive
 
03:25:37.429 --> 03:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
director of the ecba
 
03:25:39.530 --> 03:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
um we originally were very much involved
 
03:25:40.370 --> 03:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
with the study commission that
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Willie is talking about
 
03:25:41.520 --> 03:25:42.410 align:start position:0%
representative Willie is talking about
and

03:25:42.410 --> 03:25:42.420 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
um we've been paying 125 and over the
 
03:25:47.090 --> 03:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
course of the years of doing this we we
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
were on our own
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
um just under the governor like all
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
these other boards we moved to the
 
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety when we did and we
 
03:25:55.070 --> 03:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
were told it's going to get better and
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
administratively and they were going to
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
help us and then our money got used for
 
03:26:02.389 --> 03:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
the stuff that 25 became very lucrative
 
03:26:05.210 --> 03:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
in essence we're cash cows because we
 
03:26:08.630 --> 03:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
cover our fees plus 25 so
 
03:26:10.790 --> 03:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we felt that the non-lapsing fund was
 
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
definitely holding back the oplc and
 
03:26:15.410 --> 03:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
servicing the licensees and we we agree
 
03:26:17.450 --> 03:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
that that should go forward I believe
 
03:26:19.729 --> 03:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
that this warning in 445 that's supposed
 
03:26:21.229 --> 03:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
to be merged according to representative
 
03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire that had something about the cap
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
originally we wanted the cap because as
 
03:26:27.950 --> 03:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
the administration's changes and the
 
03:26:29.809 --> 03:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
director and executive director over
 
03:26:29.819 --> 03:26:31.030 align:start position:0%
director and executive director over
time

03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:26:33.710 --> 03:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
we've seen abuse happen in other
 
03:26:35.450 --> 03:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
situations where and it's always hoping
 
03:26:37.670 --> 03:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
that protected but we would much rather
 
03:26:40.070 --> 03:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
see all the money go back to us and
 
03:26:42.050 --> 03:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
especially talking about a building if
 
03:26:43.550 --> 03:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
they're looking to do that maybe there's
 
03:26:46.250 --> 03:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
a way to specify that maybe other than
 
03:26:48.889 --> 03:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
that cap the rest goes into a fund to
 
03:26:52.190 --> 03:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
purchase a building because we went as
 
03:26:54.650 --> 03:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
she explained from 200 000 to 800 000
 
03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't any fault of the executive
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
director it was just how it happened so
 
03:27:02.450 --> 03:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're now going to pay I believe it's
 
03:27:03.889 --> 03:27:03.899 align:start position:0%
10-year lease so we're going to pay
 
03:27:07.010 --> 03:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars in rent for the
 
03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
next 10 years now I don't know if
 
03:27:10.729 --> 03:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
Lindsay can let you know how long what
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
confirm the lease is 10 years and what
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
we would have to do to get out of it and
 
03:27:17.929 --> 03:27:17.939 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of putting a cap on it put
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
something in there that dedicates the
 
03:27:22.790 --> 03:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
difference towards that building that
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
would be prudent and it's a good thing
 
03:27:25.729 --> 03:27:25.739 align:start position:0%
to do
 
03:27:27.170 --> 03:27:27.180 align:start position:0%
because we don't need a building
 
03:27:29.630 --> 03:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
downtown here one is terrible parking
 
03:27:31.190 --> 03:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
you can't get in there you gotta get
 
03:27:33.410 --> 03:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
paid or Park everywhere it's just so
 
03:27:35.450 --> 03:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
some building off site will be much
 
03:27:35.460 --> 03:27:36.229 align:start position:0%
some building off site will be much
better

03:27:36.229 --> 03:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
if we can put those funds towards it
 
03:27:40.490 --> 03:27:40.500 align:start position:0%
that would be you know be a smart thing
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
to do and take the difference of that
 
03:27:44.510 --> 03:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
cap you just don't want that cap getting
 
03:27:44.520 --> 03:27:45.650 align:start position:0%
cap you just don't want that cap getting
abused

03:27:45.650 --> 03:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
abused
 
03:27:48.889 --> 03:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
and then some of the things that I know
 
03:27:50.210 --> 03:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
that they've been fighting and I hope
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
that if this goes through will change we
 
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
had put in our budget years before when
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
we moved that every year we purchased a
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
new car for our inspectors we had four
 
03:27:57.600 --> 03:27:58.849 align:start position:0%
new car for our inspectors we had four
inspectors

03:27:58.849 --> 03:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
03:28:00.650 --> 03:28:00.660 align:start position:0%
after so each car would end up being
 
03:28:02.809 --> 03:28:02.819 align:start position:0%
four years old a couple hundred thousand
 
03:28:04.370 --> 03:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
miles on it starting to cost more than
 
03:28:05.210 --> 03:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
do it
 
03:28:07.010 --> 03:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
now we're getting hand-me-downs to the
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
mechanical board that just moved in
 
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
there I don't know what happened to our
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
cars I know that the budget's been
 
03:28:13.429 --> 03:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
constricted with everything that she's
 
03:28:15.710 --> 03:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do so we hope that this would
 
03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:17.939 align:start position:0%
help fix this and give our inspector
 
03:28:19.849 --> 03:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
some dedicated spaces in the office
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
himself I know they're supposed to be on
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
the field but they still need a place to
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
land to write out reports take care of
 
03:28:27.410 --> 03:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
things and stuff and so
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
we're cautious as to letting the you
 
03:28:32.090 --> 03:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
know whether we need the cap or what's
 
03:28:33.229 --> 03:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
going to happen with it is it going to
 
03:28:35.150 --> 03:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
go back to us I don't think I don't
 
03:28:37.309 --> 03:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
think personally sending refunds is good
 
03:28:38.929 --> 03:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
I think decreasing the fees going
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
forward if it if the money was there
 
03:28:42.349 --> 03:28:42.359 align:start position:0%
would be the best thing to do as well
 
03:28:44.809 --> 03:28:44.819 align:start position:0%
but so providing that wording is coming
 
03:28:47.030 --> 03:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
in and this committee might I know it
 
03:28:48.650 --> 03:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
might but Ways and Means for the dollar
 
03:28:50.809 --> 03:28:50.819 align:start position:0%
amount but maybe there's a way to
 
03:28:53.630 --> 03:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate that additional money keep
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
it all there and put it towards
 
03:28:57.550 --> 03:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
for you know looking for a new building
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
depending on how long that is if it's 10
 
03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:01.739 align:start position:0%
years out and they put you know
 
03:29:03.290 --> 03:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
five million dollars a year towards the
 
03:29:04.670 --> 03:29:04.680 align:start position:0%
building or whatever it may be you know
 
03:29:06.050 --> 03:29:06.060 align:start position:0%
what I mean it's maybe the committee can
 
03:29:07.610 --> 03:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
come up with something so we support the
 
03:29:09.769 --> 03:29:09.779 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing we're cautious about the
 
03:29:11.150 --> 03:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
abuse and we hope that it does go back
 
03:29:13.309 --> 03:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
to us in the way that it should to get
 
03:29:15.410 --> 03:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
us back to where we were and even simple
 
03:29:17.570 --> 03:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
things I think they need for licensing
 
03:29:19.309 --> 03:29:19.319 align:start position:0%
you know we've mentioned before I can't
 
03:29:20.750 --> 03:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
even get a license printed outright
 
03:29:23.050 --> 03:29:23.060 align:start position:0%
because they have to fight with a
 
03:29:25.370 --> 03:29:25.380 align:start position:0%
DOI for the state as opposed to them
 
03:29:26.929 --> 03:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
having their own software to do it it's
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
a torture so we little things like that
 
03:29:32.269 --> 03:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
would be good to get back to having so
 
03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you any questions
 
03:29:38.389 --> 03:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you very much would anyone else
 
03:29:41.750 --> 03:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
like to speak on this bill
 
03:29:43.250 --> 03:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
not all
 
03:29:45.889 --> 03:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
welcome back Senator Lane
 
03:29:47.690 --> 03:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you guys I just wanted to speak to
 
03:29:49.490 --> 03:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
the cap that you're talking about what's
 
03:29:51.229 --> 03:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
going on we did consider that over in
 
03:29:54.050 --> 03:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the reason why we chose
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
not we we consciously chose not to put a
 
03:29:59.210 --> 03:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
cap on here is because our goal is to
 
03:30:01.130 --> 03:30:01.140 align:start position:0%
allow the director to create a 10-year
 
03:30:01.140 --> 03:30:01.910 align:start position:0%
allow the director to create a 10-year
plan

03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:30:04.550 --> 03:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and be able to say this much money
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
this of this fund is is set aside for
 
03:30:08.630 --> 03:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
this purpose that we know in five years
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this big number
 
03:30:11.510 --> 03:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
expense of whatever that might be
 
03:30:13.190 --> 03:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's a building or anything else
 
03:30:15.830 --> 03:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
but the reason we specifically chose not
 
03:30:17.630 --> 03:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
to and instead put a reporting
 
03:30:19.130 --> 03:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
requirement is is just for that reason
 
03:30:21.469 --> 03:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
we want oplc to be able to create a
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
long-term plan like we do in our cities
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
and towns our counties in our school
 
03:30:28.010 --> 03:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
districts is to be able to use that fund
 
03:30:30.050 --> 03:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
and and be able to earmark money and say
 
03:30:31.849 --> 03:30:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay we've set aside to you know the
 
03:30:33.170 --> 03:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
three million dollars we have this year
 
03:30:34.849 --> 03:30:34.859 align:start position:0%
the money that was lapsing we're gonna
 
03:30:36.530 --> 03:30:36.540 align:start position:0%
we're gonna set aside 500 million
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
dollars for a building if that's what
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
we're doing or whatever the long-term
 
03:30:41.809 --> 03:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
capital expenditure is that in 10 years
 
03:30:44.630 --> 03:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
I know we have to make and so that was
 
03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
the reason why we specifically chose not
 
03:30:49.190 --> 03:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
to put a cap on the bill and to instead
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
require reporting requirements so the
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
legislature knows what the heck they're
 
03:30:53.389 --> 03:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
doing with the money
 
03:30:54.650 --> 03:30:54.660 align:start position:0%
um that we know that they're putting
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
aside money because they're going to
 
03:30:57.229 --> 03:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
have a major software upgrade that's
 
03:30:59.150 --> 03:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
going to cost you know three million
 
03:31:01.250 --> 03:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
dollars in five years in the next five
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
years so they're going to start setting
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
aside that money so it's not a one-time
 
03:31:06.050 --> 03:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
hit of three million dollars zeroing out
 
03:31:07.610 --> 03:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
the fund but instead be able to set
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
aside the money and use it just like a
 
03:31:11.330 --> 03:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
savings account from the people that it
 
03:31:13.130 --> 03:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
benefits to be able to take care of that
 
03:31:15.650 --> 03:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
so they don't get hit with a an increase
 
03:31:17.870 --> 03:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
because they had a three million of 4.5
 
03:31:20.990 --> 03:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar you know overrun on on
 
03:31:23.389 --> 03:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
costs and they can now use this fund off
 
03:31:26.330 --> 03:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
set that not have to raise fees so that
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
was just to be clear that being said if
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell me you're going to
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
kill my bill without a cap you've got to
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
put the cap on it so I'll be pragmatic
 
03:31:37.610 --> 03:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
and take what I can get but I just want
 
03:31:39.170 --> 03:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
to make you aware the Senate did discuss
 
03:31:41.690 --> 03:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
this at length about setting a cap and
 
03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
the reason we didn't because we expect
 
03:31:45.170 --> 03:31:45.180 align:start position:0%
the director to create a 10-year plan
 
03:31:47.510 --> 03:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
and talk about big Capital expenditures
 
03:31:49.130 --> 03:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
they may have coming up and be able to
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
create set-asides for that money so
 
03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard thank you chair
 
03:31:57.469 --> 03:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking of the previous
 
03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
10-year plan with the lease on the
 
03:31:59.040 --> 03:31:59.690 align:start position:0%
10-year plan with the lease on the
building

03:31:59.690 --> 03:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:32:02.090 --> 03:32:02.100 align:start position:0%
so it breaks down to six thousand six
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
hundred sixty six dollars per person per
 
03:32:06.530 --> 03:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
year to rent that
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
do a lease it so would this if there was
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
to be no cap and there was a chunk of
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
chunk of change sitting in there would
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature have say on what occurs
 
03:32:16.250 --> 03:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
with that money or they would simply go
 
03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
out build a building and we see
 
03:32:19.370 --> 03:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
afterwards the effects of decisions that
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
they make so again that would still go
 
03:32:22.910 --> 03:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
through a Das process right because
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
there's Contracting and all kinds of
 
03:32:26.389 --> 03:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
stuff that has to happen in the creation
 
03:32:28.670 --> 03:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
of a new State Building so that would
 
03:32:30.710 --> 03:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
still uh I don't think any of that would
 
03:32:32.330 --> 03:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
change the difference is that the
 
03:32:33.650 --> 03:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
funding source for that building would
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:40.610 --> 03:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.410 --> 03:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:32:44.690 --> 03:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator appreciate it
 
03:32:48.969 --> 03:32:48.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:51.290 --> 03:32:51.300 align:start position:0%
this is a hell of a way to negotiate
 
03:32:54.110 --> 03:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
with the Senate I was just thinking the
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
same thing
 
03:32:57.650 --> 03:32:57.660 align:start position:0%
but on
 
03:32:57.660 --> 03:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
but on
the

03:32:59.090 --> 03:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:33:02.349 --> 03:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
what is here doesn't really explain that
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
and this is the first time we'd heard
 
03:33:07.969 --> 03:33:07.979 align:start position:0%
that there was is it 800 000 or 900 000
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
a year
 
03:33:14.389 --> 03:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
building that they've been forced into
 
03:33:19.490 --> 03:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
um and on I don't think it makes it more
 
03:33:22.130 --> 03:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
important that this biennial report on
 
03:33:25.250 --> 03:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
the expenditures of the fund specifies
 
03:33:28.429 --> 03:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
what it is that you're looking for
 
03:33:31.550 --> 03:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
to make this thing work and I do think
 
03:33:35.570 --> 03:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is that we're trying
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
to solve a long-term problem with the
 
03:33:39.650 --> 03:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
short term
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
view of it so that if this can be much
 
03:33:46.030 --> 03:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
better done in a few years after
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
after things have worked themselves out
 
03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
all right that's all I have for a
 
03:34:01.010 --> 03:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
testimony on this so I will
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB 49
 
03:34:05.279 --> 03:34:08.450 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on HB 49
.

03:34:08.450 --> 03:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.130 --> 03:34:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:40.140 --> 03:35:40.070 align:start position:0%
 
understand

03:35:40.070 --> 03:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:47.090 --> 03:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.010 --> 03:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we'll have to change the
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
pickings okay
 
03:35:55.309 --> 03:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open the public hearing on
 
03:35:55.319 --> 03:35:58.670 align:start position:0%
I'd like to open the public hearing on
sb107

03:35:58.670 --> 03:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:10.729 --> 03:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:18.290 --> 03:36:18.300 align:start position:0%
Grand Posse for Senator Carson
 
03:36:20.210 --> 03:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
Edna committee I'm Grant bosse from the
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Senate here to introduce
 
03:36:25.969 --> 03:36:25.979 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 107 on behalf of Senator
 
03:36:27.830 --> 03:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
Sharon Carson the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
03:36:29.809 --> 03:36:29.819 align:start position:0%
she had hoped to be here but asked me to
 
03:36:31.790 --> 03:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
pinch hit if we didn't see her come over
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
the horizon
 
03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 107 seeks to amend RSA 332
 
03:36:41.090 --> 03:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
G1 which gives guidelines for regulatory
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
boards and commissions that balance the
 
03:36:44.570 --> 03:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility of safeguarding the
 
03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
health of the public with the protection
 
03:36:49.969 --> 03:36:49.979 align:start position:0%
of those who work in their fields sp107
 
03:36:51.830 --> 03:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
would make sure entry into the workforce
 
03:36:57.349 --> 03:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
is not barred under RSA 332 G10 boards
 
03:36:59.330 --> 03:36:59.340 align:start position:0%
are prohibited from denying entry into a
 
03:37:00.889 --> 03:37:00.899 align:start position:0%
profession based on a past criminal
 
03:37:03.710 --> 03:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
conviction unless there is a substantial
 
03:37:05.690 --> 03:37:05.700 align:start position:0%
relationship between the profession and
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
the past criminal conviction but under
 
03:37:10.910 --> 03:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
RSA 332 G13
 
03:37:13.190 --> 03:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
an individual May petition the board at
 
03:37:15.530 --> 03:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
any time to determine if that person's
 
03:37:17.630 --> 03:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
criminal record would disqualify that
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
person from obtaining State recognition
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
in practicing in their desired
 
03:37:25.010 --> 03:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
profession SB 107 seeks to reconcile the
 
03:37:26.330 --> 03:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
two different standards in these
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
statutes maintaining the substantial and
 
03:37:30.590 --> 03:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
direct relationship between the
 
03:37:32.650 --> 03:37:32.660 align:start position:0%
conviction and the occupation
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
sb107 would require boards to
 
03:37:36.830 --> 03:37:36.840 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that denial suspension or
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
revocation of a license serves to
 
03:37:41.450 --> 03:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
protect Public Safety the right to
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
petition aboard and appeal decisions are
 
03:37:45.769 --> 03:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
included and it sets time frames for
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
boards to respond to such requests SB
 
03:37:51.710 --> 03:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
107 clarifies the language of RSA 332g
 
03:37:53.630 --> 03:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
in such a way that it protects Public
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
Safety but also ensures fairness for the
 
03:37:57.950 --> 03:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
applicant creating a consistent standard
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
a few other provisions of the bill it
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
creates a carve out under RSA 332 G3 for
 
03:38:07.429 --> 03:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
boards under the oplc it amends RSA 332
 
03:38:10.729 --> 03:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
G8 to clarify the time frame for which a
 
03:38:12.349 --> 03:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
border commission must conclude hearings
 
03:38:15.889 --> 03:38:15.899 align:start position:0%
and it repeals RSA 332 G5 relative to
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
the right to appeal decisions before the
 
03:38:21.530 --> 03:38:21.540 align:start position:0%
electrician's board SB 107 was amended
 
03:38:23.330 --> 03:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
by the Senate Edna committee to include
 
03:38:26.030 --> 03:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
suggested language from oplc and it
 
03:38:28.610 --> 03:38:28.620 align:start position:0%
passed on the consent calendar if you
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
have questions specific for Senator
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
Carson I'll be sure she gets you an
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
answer otherwise I would defer to the
 
03:38:36.530 --> 03:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
oplc staff here on the implementation of
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
the bill Senator Carson thanks you for
 
03:38:40.910 --> 03:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
your consideration and support of Senate
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
Bill 107. thank you
 
03:38:44.570 --> 03:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
I think you're all set
 
03:38:57.170 --> 03:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
03:39:01.969 --> 03:39:01.979 align:start position:0%
committee I didn't
 
03:39:04.969 --> 03:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
don't have much to add except that it's
 
03:39:08.389 --> 03:39:08.399 align:start position:0%
very important to clarify the issue of
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
criminal records because that can be a
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
barrier to entry and so this is to
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that someone who has a
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
a record that is not perfectly clear is
 
03:39:26.210 --> 03:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
given due process and fair consideration
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
of whether that should stop them from
 
03:39:31.010 --> 03:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
working and I strongly support that
 
03:39:31.020 --> 03:39:32.990 align:start position:0%
working and I strongly support that

section
 
03:39:34.670 --> 03:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you answer questions if you have
 
03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
them any questions
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%

John garrigan and Douglas osterhot
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:56.269 --> 03:39:56.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair members of the
 
03:39:57.410 --> 03:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for having us my
 
03:39:58.849 --> 03:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
name is Douglas osterhau I am General
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
counselor for oplc uh with me is John
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
garrigan John I'll let you introduce
 
03:40:02.640 --> 03:40:03.889 align:start position:0%
garrigan John I'll let you introduce
yourself

03:40:03.889 --> 03:40:03.899 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm John garrigan I'm the chief
 
03:40:09.229 --> 03:40:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
I think the bill was presented very well
 
03:40:14.690 --> 03:40:14.700 align:start position:0%
and uh kind of hits on the points that I
 
03:40:16.490 --> 03:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
would hit on but I would just for a
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
little background information the reason
 
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
oplc asked to have this change made is
 
03:40:23.450 --> 03:40:23.460 align:start position:0%
we've come across some sort of
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
conflicting language between 332 G10 and
 
03:40:30.550 --> 03:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
332 G13 and so both of those
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
deal with criminal background checks and
 
03:40:35.750 --> 03:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
how they pertain to licensure one of the
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
difficulties is that the standard is
 
03:40:41.870 --> 03:40:41.880 align:start position:0%
actually different so under 32g10 the
 
03:40:43.250 --> 03:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
criminal background check would have to
 
03:40:46.969 --> 03:40:46.979 align:start position:0%
be substantially related under 332g 13
 
03:40:48.889 --> 03:40:48.899 align:start position:0%
you would have to have a violent
 
03:40:52.130 --> 03:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or felony conviction so it
 
03:40:54.050 --> 03:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
actually creates a couple of interesting
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios where potentially an
 
03:41:00.170 --> 03:41:00.180 align:start position:0%
individual could apply under 332g13
 
03:41:03.650 --> 03:41:03.660 align:start position:0%
which allows for a it's kind of a
 
03:41:05.389 --> 03:41:05.399 align:start position:0%
declaratory ruling in front of the board
 
03:41:07.370 --> 03:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
and you you go before the board and you
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
said based on my criminal background
 
03:41:11.090 --> 03:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
check would this preclude me from
 
03:41:13.070 --> 03:41:13.080 align:start position:0%
licensure and you could go through that
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
analysis you could get the green light
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
to go ahead for the board but because
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
the standards are different when it came
 
03:41:21.889 --> 03:41:21.899 align:start position:0%
time to do the application itself
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
you could be denied that could actually
 
03:41:25.250 --> 03:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
happen after you've done the course
 
03:41:28.429 --> 03:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
sought permission from the board Etc the
 
03:41:29.870 --> 03:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
other interesting thing that could
 
03:41:31.729 --> 03:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
potentially arise and we haven't seen
 
03:41:34.490 --> 03:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
this come up before but theoretically it
 
03:41:37.250 --> 03:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
could happen is that an individual could
 
03:41:39.429 --> 03:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
apply for licensure
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
and simultaneously because under 13 you
 
03:41:46.130 --> 03:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
have the ability to petition the board
 
03:41:47.809 --> 03:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
at any time so you could apply for
 
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
licensure have the 332 G10 standard
 
03:41:51.720 --> 03:41:53.929 align:start position:0%
licensure have the 332 G10 standard
foreign

03:41:53.929 --> 03:41:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
have that 332 G10 standard applied and
 
03:42:00.110 --> 03:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
simultaneously like I said go before the
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
board with a 32 G13 standard which is
 
03:42:05.650 --> 03:42:05.660 align:start position:0%
that violent misdemeanor felony language
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
and same individual same set of facts
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
you could potentially Come Away with a
 
03:42:11.870 --> 03:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
different answer depending on which
 
03:42:15.170 --> 03:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
standard we noticed this we got into a
 
03:42:17.090 --> 03:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
conversation the question came before
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
the oplc and our attorneys as to whether
 
03:42:22.309 --> 03:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
or not an application was a petition
 
03:42:26.570 --> 03:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
under 332g13 and that kind of got us
 
03:42:28.729 --> 03:42:28.739 align:start position:0%
down the road we were in today so our
 
03:42:31.969 --> 03:42:31.979 align:start position:0%
goal with this is really just to tighten
 
03:42:33.769 --> 03:42:33.779 align:start position:0%
up the language you can see we've asked
 
03:42:37.309 --> 03:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
for a repeal of 332 G13 in its entirety
 
03:42:39.410 --> 03:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
but we took a lot of that language and
 
03:42:44.090 --> 03:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
just moved it up to 332 G10 so we stayed
 
03:42:46.130 --> 03:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
with the clear and convincing standard
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
because we are talking about licensure
 
03:42:49.610 --> 03:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
it should be difficult to deny someone
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
from practicing and then we kept the
 
03:42:54.490 --> 03:42:54.500 align:start position:0%
substantially related language which
 
03:43:00.010 --> 03:43:00.020 align:start position:0%
from 332 G10 we kept language from
 
03:43:02.809 --> 03:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
332g13 as I said and so hopefully we end
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
up when the language is combined with
 
03:43:06.950 --> 03:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
sort of The Best of Both Worlds and
 
03:43:08.809 --> 03:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for consistent answers from
 
03:43:11.330 --> 03:43:11.340 align:start position:0%
boards for licensees and just a fair
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
process across the board there is some
 
03:43:16.190 --> 03:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
additional language in here
 
03:43:18.229 --> 03:43:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh some of it's just clean up language
 
03:43:22.250 --> 03:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
but I do want to point out I'm looking
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
at page three on the PDF line 11.
 
03:43:30.530 --> 03:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
Section 5 says repeal RSA 332 G5
 
03:43:33.050 --> 03:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
relative to the right to appeal final
 
03:43:35.389 --> 03:43:35.399 align:start position:0%
decisions of the elect electricians
 
03:43:38.510 --> 03:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
board that request was put in when
 
03:43:42.170 --> 03:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
original 655 was put into before the
 
03:43:44.150 --> 03:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
house and so it was part of that whole
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
cleanup package I just wanted to point
 
03:43:47.630 --> 03:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
it out because I know the house pulled a
 
03:43:50.690 --> 03:43:50.700 align:start position:0%
lot of that cleanup language out of 655
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it's something we'll probably be
 
03:43:56.570 --> 03:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
addressing next legislative season but
 
03:43:59.570 --> 03:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
um it might also in in line with that be
 
03:44:01.010 --> 03:44:01.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate to pull it here that's a
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
policy decision but I did want to flag
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
it for the committee today happy to take
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
03:44:12.769 --> 03:44:12.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so uh as you're
 
03:44:19.090 --> 03:44:19.100 align:start position:0%
probably aware from your review
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh there have been complaints uh from
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
the public or at least advocacy on
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
behalf of uh a review of this whole
 
03:44:32.410 --> 03:44:32.420 align:start position:0%
situation because a lot of the license
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
requirements in the past you talked of a
 
03:44:39.349 --> 03:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
good moral character or and use words
 
03:44:43.370 --> 03:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
like moral turpitude and so forth a lot
 
03:44:45.410 --> 03:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
of that has been pulled out of the
 
03:44:49.010 --> 03:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
statute because it was deemed to be
 
03:44:52.729 --> 03:44:52.739 align:start position:0%
you know too heavy-handed but you have
 
03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
situations where
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
people may have a criminal record
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you know involves some kind of
 
03:45:01.920 --> 03:45:03.250 align:start position:0%
that you know involves some kind of
physical

03:45:03.250 --> 03:45:03.260 align:start position:0%
physical
 
03:45:07.750 --> 03:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh misconduct and and people
 
03:45:13.309 --> 03:45:13.319 align:start position:0%
would potentially be look being they
 
03:45:16.910 --> 03:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
would be looking at trying to get a p an
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
appeal through where they want to
 
03:45:20.389 --> 03:45:20.399 align:start position:0%
practice something where they would be
 
03:45:22.670 --> 03:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
in contact physical contact with
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
clientele or so forth and that becomes a
 
03:45:29.090 --> 03:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
pretty Sticky Wicket so uh
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
did you feel that this proposed language
 
03:45:35.870 --> 03:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:39.290 --> 03:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
resolve all the issues I know asking for
 
03:45:39.300 --> 03:45:40.729 align:start position:0%
resolve all the issues I know asking for
perfectionist

03:45:40.729 --> 03:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
perfectionist
 
03:45:43.370 --> 03:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
too high a standard but resolve all the
 
03:45:45.530 --> 03:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
issues could you just speak to my
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
question and the changes that we've
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
already made over the last 20 years
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
I think this bill is going to be a
 
03:45:58.070 --> 03:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
really good instrument to allow
 
03:46:00.530 --> 03:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
it's going to protect applicants so that
 
03:46:02.750 --> 03:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
they don't get denied licensure based
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
solely on a criminal record but I think
 
03:46:07.010 --> 03:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
it's also going to give boards
 
03:46:09.710 --> 03:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
professional boards the ability to take
 
03:46:12.290 --> 03:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
a look at that and make sure that
 
03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
they're not letting through say a
 
03:46:16.370 --> 03:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
violent offender or somebody it's going
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
to give them the flexibility is that
 
03:46:22.250 --> 03:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
does help uh follow up follow up so the
 
03:46:25.490 --> 03:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
thing is and and these appeals would it
 
03:46:28.250 --> 03:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
be handled Now by one office Mr
 
03:46:31.190 --> 03:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
garrigan's office or whatever and and so
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
forth if so you'd have one office
 
03:46:36.170 --> 03:46:36.180 align:start position:0%
handling all boards reviews as opposed
 
03:46:38.330 --> 03:46:38.340 align:start position:0%
to because in the past I think it was
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
kind of piecemeal
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this would solve that issue
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
because not all boards under 332 gr
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
title 30 boards or oplc boards I do
 
03:46:51.769 --> 03:46:51.779 align:start position:0%
think it's a good change for the state
 
03:46:54.530 --> 03:46:54.540 align:start position:0%
regardless because it's going to ensure
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
consistency and application or at least
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't it's a step in the right
 
03:47:00.590 --> 03:47:00.600 align:start position:0%
direction okay but but again that is why
 
03:47:02.450 --> 03:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
we tried to combine that substantially
 
03:47:04.550 --> 03:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
related language with
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
with you know the 310 and 332g13
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
one more so but in your opinion this is
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
clearly a better process and that we
 
03:47:17.389 --> 03:47:17.399 align:start position:0%
should be adopting this I would say even
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't get the perfect
 
03:47:21.110 --> 03:47:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think so like I said we did try in
 
03:47:22.610 --> 03:47:22.620 align:start position:0%
drafting the language and proposing it
 
03:47:25.670 --> 03:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
bringing forward we tried to capture the
 
03:47:28.010 --> 03:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
best of both statutes okay thank you
 
03:47:29.809 --> 03:47:29.819 align:start position:0%
very much
 
03:47:31.309 --> 03:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
03:47:31.319 --> 03:47:32.809 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
Cooley

03:47:32.809 --> 03:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
Cooley
 
03:47:34.510 --> 03:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:47:37.610 --> 03:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
and the final determinations are still
 
03:47:38.929 --> 03:47:38.939 align:start position:0%
going to be left up
 
03:47:41.090 --> 03:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
to the board or your office correct the
 
03:47:41.100 --> 03:47:43.309 align:start position:0%
to the board or your office correct the
board

03:47:43.309 --> 03:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
follow up and going back uh uh to the
 
03:47:51.110 --> 03:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
final page on these repeals
 
03:47:55.130 --> 03:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
uh line 13 repealing G13 relative to the
 
03:47:57.530 --> 03:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
right to petition a board for review and
 
03:48:00.110 --> 03:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
criminal record is repealed that go over
 
03:48:03.889 --> 03:48:03.899 align:start position:0%
that one more time as to that repeal
 
03:48:06.050 --> 03:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat the question
 
03:48:09.050 --> 03:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
go over that repeal one more time on G13
 
03:48:13.610 --> 03:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
yeah so 332 G13 was that's the title of
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
this section the right to petition the
 
03:48:17.090 --> 03:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
board and that lets you petition the
 
03:48:19.429 --> 03:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
board at any time to see if your
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
criminal background check would preclude
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
you from licensure but that could come
 
03:48:26.330 --> 03:48:26.340 align:start position:0%
before the application process but again
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
that standard was different it was
 
03:48:31.729 --> 03:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
relying solely on the felony or violent
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor language so what we did was
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
we actually took a lot of that language
 
03:48:38.690 --> 03:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
from G13 I don't have both bills and are
 
03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
both in front of me but if you look at
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
the language of SP 107 you would see
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
that a lot of that language verbatim
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
from 13 was just moved up into 10 to put
 
03:48:49.250 --> 03:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
it all in one space
 
03:48:53.330 --> 03:48:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt so it just
 
03:49:00.530 --> 03:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
occurred to me how much how much of this
 
03:49:03.110 --> 03:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
appeal stuff is there out there among
 
03:49:05.570 --> 03:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
all the boards I mean is it uh we're
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with a lot of appeals or is it
 
03:49:10.969 --> 03:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
just a question of however many we have
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
we should be handling it better than we
 
03:49:15.050 --> 03:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
do I would say the second I couldn't
 
03:49:16.550 --> 03:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
give you an answer because this is for
 
03:49:19.010 --> 03:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
licensure application right purposes I
 
03:49:20.389 --> 03:49:20.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a number off the top of my
 
03:49:22.729 --> 03:49:22.739 align:start position:0%
head how many cases looking up in this
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have seen them now and it came up
 
03:49:27.769 --> 03:49:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:29.210 --> 03:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
thank you gentlemen
 
03:49:31.010 --> 03:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:49:47.150 --> 03:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.160 --> 03:49:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:49:48.229 --> 03:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:49:49.849 --> 03:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
good afternoon committee my name is
 
03:49:51.650 --> 03:49:51.660 align:start position:0%
Steven reincourt licensed electrician
 
03:49:52.969 --> 03:49:52.979 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire and representing
 
03:49:55.130 --> 03:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
the ecba we just had a couple of
 
03:49:58.969 --> 03:49:58.979 align:start position:0%
comments less concerns on page one line
 
03:50:01.490 --> 03:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
three we just want to make sure and
 
03:50:03.530 --> 03:50:03.540 align:start position:0%
clarify that they're using State
 
03:50:06.050 --> 03:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
recognition throughout the document but
 
03:50:08.090 --> 03:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's just for this bill so they can
 
03:50:09.830 --> 03:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
refer to those and it's not changing
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
what those are because that would have a
 
03:50:13.849 --> 03:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
much bigger impact so if the committee
 
03:50:15.050 --> 03:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
can make sure that that's all it is
 
03:50:18.410 --> 03:50:18.420 align:start position:0%
which I believe and then if um if the
 
03:50:21.410 --> 03:50:21.420 align:start position:0%
oplc is going to uh recommendation is to
 
03:50:24.769 --> 03:50:24.779 align:start position:0%
move section 332 G5 we obviously had a
 
03:50:27.410 --> 03:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
concern with that were you okay with the
 
03:50:29.210 --> 03:50:29.220 align:start position:0%
bill if they removed that if not we had
 
03:50:30.950 --> 03:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
some proposed amendment that we'd like
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
to submit to the board if they're going
 
03:50:34.370 --> 03:50:34.380 align:start position:0%
to consider keeping it to add some
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
additional warning that has to do with
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
our appeal to the State Building Code
 
03:50:41.330 --> 03:50:41.340 align:start position:0%
board for applicable and in uh codes so
 
03:50:43.790 --> 03:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
if they're going to remove it if not I
 
03:50:45.530 --> 03:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
had some testimony to hand out it's
 
03:50:46.849 --> 03:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
totally up to the committee if you want
 
03:50:48.650 --> 03:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
it or what they're why don't you hand it
 
03:50:48.660 --> 03:50:49.309 align:start position:0%
it or what they're why don't you hand it
out

03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:51:06.950 --> 03:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
other than those two concerns as uh Doug
 
03:51:11.809 --> 03:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know sometimes you can
 
03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
have somebody come in and apply do the
 
03:51:16.010 --> 03:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
pre pre-approval thing to make sure they
 
03:51:17.570 --> 03:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
fit the qualifications and there was
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
some confusion at the end you really
 
03:51:20.690 --> 03:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
don't want somebody going through four
 
03:51:22.729 --> 03:51:22.739 align:start position:0%
years of schooling and work and find out
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
they can't do it after they were told
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
they were so we we think that the bill
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
fixes a lot of that and we're okay with
 
03:51:29.330 --> 03:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
that it was just those two issues so
 
03:51:29.340 --> 03:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
that it was just those two issues so
great

03:51:31.190 --> 03:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
great
 
03:51:32.450 --> 03:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:51:34.130 --> 03:51:34.140 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:36.530 --> 03:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who would like to
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:49.130 --> 03:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.809 --> 03:51:55.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
I was here I don't know where you were I
 
03:52:02.530 --> 03:52:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:04.969 --> 03:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
but the um schedule says we were
 
03:52:06.410 --> 03:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
supposed to meet at 1 30 for this bill
 
03:52:48.530 --> 03:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:49.969 --> 03:52:49.979 align:start position:0%
um that's something we should discuss
 
03:52:55.130 --> 03:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
all right there's a couple of issues
 
03:52:58.729 --> 03:52:58.739 align:start position:0%
that we might need to discuss with this
 
03:53:00.590 --> 03:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to
 
03:53:04.670 --> 03:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:08.809 --> 03:53:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.330 --> 03:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'll second okay
 
03:53:11.340 --> 03:53:13.849 align:start position:0%
I'll second okay
um

03:53:13.849 --> 03:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns that we ought to
 
03:53:19.220 --> 03:53:19.230 align:start position:0%
discuss before we vote so representative
 
03:53:19.230 --> 03:53:23.349 align:start position:0%
discuss before we vote so representative
[Music]

03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:26.929 --> 03:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
well we we were discussing that uh
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
there were concerns about uh what was
 
03:53:31.849 --> 03:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
put forward by the electrician's board
 
03:53:31.859 --> 03:53:34.070 align:start position:0%
put forward by the electrician's board
and

03:53:34.070 --> 03:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I think given a little time perhaps
 
03:53:39.050 --> 03:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
they can work something out he I just
 
03:53:42.410 --> 03:53:42.420 align:start position:0%
saw them discussing with with the legal
 
03:53:42.420 --> 03:53:43.670 align:start position:0%
saw them discussing with with the legal
counsel

03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
03:53:43.680 --> 03:53:56.030 align:start position:0%
counsel
um

03:53:56.030 --> 03:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:56.040 --> 03:53:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:53:59.870 --> 03:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gould did I misunderstand
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
I thought that the concern was about
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
something that's that's going to be
 
03:54:03.720 --> 03:54:04.969 align:start position:0%
something that's that's going to be
removed

03:54:04.969 --> 03:54:04.979 align:start position:0%
removed
 
03:54:04.979 --> 03:54:06.650 align:start position:0%
removed
yes

03:54:06.650 --> 03:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
and then the other concern was State
 
03:54:12.349 --> 03:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
recognition which I obviously that that
 
03:54:15.650 --> 03:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
term caught my ear that's the
 
03:54:18.769 --> 03:54:18.779 align:start position:0%
who as I recall the testimony he was
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
saying that's used in this
 
03:54:24.889 --> 03:54:24.899 align:start position:0%
in this bill to mean or the section to
 
03:54:26.450 --> 03:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
mean essentially license or
 
03:54:28.490 --> 03:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
certification or registration or
 
03:54:28.500 --> 03:54:29.689 align:start position:0%
certification or registration or
whatever

03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:54:31.610 --> 03:54:31.620 align:start position:0%
instead of saying
 
03:54:34.490 --> 03:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
license certification registration it
 
03:54:38.710 --> 03:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
says recognition so if that's just a a
 
03:54:41.389 --> 03:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
replacement word kind of thing or an
 
03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
alternate word and the other sections
 
03:54:45.830 --> 03:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
being removed is there any further well
 
03:54:48.830 --> 03:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
the question is should that
 
03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:52.309 align:start position:0%
the question is should that
are

03:54:52.309 --> 03:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:56.570 --> 03:54:56.580 align:start position:0%
should 332 G5 be removed
 
03:54:59.689 --> 03:54:59.699 align:start position:0%
because it allows an appeal to the State
 
03:55:02.030 --> 03:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
Building Code review board
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
in the cases where the question is the
 
03:55:08.090 --> 03:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the of the building
 
03:55:08.100 --> 03:55:10.010 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the of the building
code

03:55:10.010 --> 03:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:55:17.950 --> 03:55:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.229 --> 03:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt
 
03:55:23.210 --> 03:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
yes representative goalie thank you
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair if you wave I think you want
 
03:55:26.290 --> 03:55:26.300 align:start position:0%
to talk
 
03:55:29.809 --> 03:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
yeah and
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
I look at the repeal that we hear from
 
03:55:33.889 --> 03:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
Mr raincoat that he would like to see
 
03:55:36.650 --> 03:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
that repeal removed from this
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
no it's it's our statute not theirs
 
03:55:50.809 --> 03:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
sorry Steve Ryan court again um if the
 
03:55:52.790 --> 03:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
oplc is willing to remove that repeal
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
because we would lose the ability to
 
03:55:57.050 --> 03:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
appeal to the state building code for
 
03:55:58.729 --> 03:55:58.739 align:start position:0%
either fire or building codes for
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation and application you don't
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
have to go to Supreme Court because I
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
understand a certain code a certain way
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
and we might not disagree with the board
 
03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's all so we don't want to lose that
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
ability and if you repeal that we would
 
03:56:13.729 --> 03:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
how if I may ask how often does this
 
03:56:16.670 --> 03:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
come up is this a couple of cases a year
 
03:56:18.889 --> 03:56:18.899 align:start position:0%
I would say probably something I've
 
03:56:21.170 --> 03:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
known probably four or five over for as
 
03:56:23.630 --> 03:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
long as it's been in there it's not um
 
03:56:25.570 --> 03:56:25.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's something that's
 
03:56:28.849 --> 03:56:28.859 align:start position:0%
abused so to speak it but when you have
 
03:56:30.469 --> 03:56:30.479 align:start position:0%
a code issue we had like one time we had
 
03:56:32.450 --> 03:56:32.460 align:start position:0%
one inspector decided a structure was
 
03:56:33.769 --> 03:56:33.779 align:start position:0%
going to be considered something else so
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
it went to the whole torturous process
 
03:56:37.729 --> 03:56:37.739 align:start position:0%
to determine that and whether or not we
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
could put generator switches on it so
 
03:56:42.469 --> 03:56:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's stuff like that okay sorry
 
03:56:47.150 --> 03:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:49.849 --> 03:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
so I guess my concern seeing we're in a
 
03:56:52.490 --> 03:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
discussion well my concern is hearing
 
03:56:54.769 --> 03:56:54.779 align:start position:0%
that explanation and it
 
03:56:57.889 --> 03:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
has a reasoning to be kept in statute
 
03:57:01.189 --> 03:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
that I would ask that we hold off and
 
03:57:03.889 --> 03:57:03.899 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to re take the repeal
 
03:57:03.899 --> 03:57:05.150 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to re take the repeal
out

03:57:05.150 --> 03:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:57:07.429 --> 03:57:07.439 align:start position:0%
before we go forward all right that
 
03:57:09.250 --> 03:57:09.260 align:start position:0%
makes sense representative Schmidt well
 
03:57:12.050 --> 03:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
you're now we're going in the direction
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
I was wondering because I presume that
 
03:57:19.729 --> 03:57:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:19.739 --> 03:57:21.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:23.030 --> 03:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
I don't recall to be honest with you
 
03:57:24.469 --> 03:57:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's been so many bills this year
 
03:57:26.929 --> 03:57:26.939 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 had a house bill too had
 
03:57:28.910 --> 03:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
some of it I don't remember if it came
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
up in the Senate no because I mean the
 
03:57:34.010 --> 03:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
two attorneys from oplc have now left
 
03:57:36.830 --> 03:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
the room so we we can't bounce it off of
 
03:57:36.840 --> 03:57:39.530 align:start position:0%
the room so we we can't bounce it off of
them

03:57:39.530 --> 03:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.330 --> 03:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
might well have
 
03:57:42.769 --> 03:57:42.779 align:start position:0%
might well have
 
03:57:42.779 --> 03:57:44.929 align:start position:0%
might well have
uh

03:57:44.929 --> 03:57:44.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
like I said there's so many pieces
 
03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
floating around this year I mean my
 
03:57:50.330 --> 03:57:50.340 align:start position:0%
question about the Senate is obviously
 
03:57:52.309 --> 03:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
if it if it came up and the Senate
 
03:57:54.290 --> 03:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
turned it down that would be significant
 
03:57:57.229 --> 03:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
but but the point is that now that the
 
03:58:00.050 --> 03:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
issue has been raised uh I think I think
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
we have to have the oplc attorneys look
 
03:58:04.610 --> 03:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
at this and decide whether how they want
 
03:58:06.349 --> 03:58:06.359 align:start position:0%
to proceed so I'm in favor of
 
03:58:08.570 --> 03:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
Representative Goldie's suggestion to
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay pull it back at the moment fair
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
enough I representative Simon thank you
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
yeah I would add that the
 
03:58:15.479 --> 03:58:16.070 align:start position:0%
yeah I would add that the
um

03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:18.889 --> 03:58:18.899 align:start position:0%
members from oplc the lawyers
 
03:58:20.870 --> 03:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
took special pains to point that out to
 
03:58:22.490 --> 03:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
us they wanted to make sure that we knew
 
03:58:24.050 --> 03:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
that it was there so they obviously
 
03:58:26.210 --> 03:58:26.220 align:start position:0%
assumed that it might be an issue that
 
03:58:27.889 --> 03:58:27.899 align:start position:0%
we should look at
 
03:58:27.899 --> 03:58:28.450 align:start position:0%
we should look at
yeah

03:58:28.450 --> 03:58:28.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you I also make him make a motion
 
03:58:33.170 --> 03:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
I mean also would like you to pull it
 
03:58:36.469 --> 03:58:36.479 align:start position:0%
back because this also overlaps a little
 
03:58:38.030 --> 03:58:38.040 align:start position:0%
bit with the what we're trying to do
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
with health bill 655.
 
03:58:42.769 --> 03:58:42.779 align:start position:0%
so I think that this is something that
 
03:58:44.570 --> 03:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
we can address with
 
03:58:47.090 --> 03:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
with everyone as a
 
03:58:50.090 --> 03:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
as opposed to specific all right well
 
03:58:50.100 --> 03:58:50.929 align:start position:0%
as opposed to specific all right well
the

03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:58:50.939 --> 03:58:51.710 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:58:51.710 --> 03:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:56.929 --> 03:58:56.939 align:start position:0%
that's fine so we will recess and
 
03:58:59.590 --> 03:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
to the next scheduled executive session
 
03:59:02.450 --> 03:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
which will be which will not be next
 
03:59:02.460 --> 03:59:03.530 align:start position:0%
which will be which will not be next
week

03:59:03.530 --> 03:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
week
 
03:59:07.729 --> 03:59:07.739 align:start position:0%
so it'll be at least two weeks uh before
 
03:59:10.269 --> 03:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
we do before I
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
this is not an early bill so there's no
 
03:59:16.030 --> 03:59:16.040 align:start position:0%
problem with it we've got all of April
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
if I may Madam chair also we did submit
 
03:59:20.570 --> 03:59:20.580 align:start position:0%
the same wording to uh the senate for
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
Hospital 655 once we realized that was
 
03:59:25.370 --> 03:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
in there as well pretty much the same
 
03:59:27.349 --> 03:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
thing it says we can only appeal to the
 
03:59:29.450 --> 03:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
state to the Supreme Court we added
 
03:59:32.330 --> 03:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
except as 674-34 allows so we're trying
 
03:59:34.250 --> 03:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
to keep it consistent if it's all for us
 
03:59:36.410 --> 03:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
okay well we will
 
03:59:39.290 --> 03:59:39.300 align:start position:0%
comes will consider what's being done in
 
03:59:41.929 --> 03:59:41.939 align:start position:0%
the sen in the Senate on 655 before we
 
03:59:44.330 --> 03:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
make any decisions on this
 
03:59:47.450 --> 03:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
all right in that case we are done there
 
03:59:49.849 --> 03:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
is no committee tomorrow but uh there is
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
session starting at nine so I'll see you
