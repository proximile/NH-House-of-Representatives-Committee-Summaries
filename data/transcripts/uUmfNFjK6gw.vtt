00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
that we work with in the house for the
 
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.550 align:start position:0%
that we work with in the house for the
past

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
i think we've had a very good working
 
00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.670 align:start position:0%
i think we've had a very good working
relationship

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
with the committee we very much
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
for the returning members this will be a
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
bit of a refresher and for the new
 
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
bit of a refresher and for the new
members

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully give you a little better idea
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
of what the department does because
 
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.869 align:start position:0%
of what the department does because
certainly

00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
when i became commissioner even i didn't
 
00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
even realize
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
just what a wide reach the department
 
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
has so i want to spend a few minutes
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
just going over and
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman at your discretion it might
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
be easier to
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
answer questions as we go along if that
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
works for you
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
dr crawford is also on the zoom call
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
and he's available hopefully for more
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions as we
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
go through the presentation because some
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
of the more technical things with
 
00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
particularly with animal
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
industry he would be better suited to to
 
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.750 align:start position:0%
industry he would be better suited to to
answer

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the general function of the
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
department is to promote
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
regulate agriculture and all its
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
branches and we
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
attempt to gather and disseminate
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
information on agriculture
 
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
crop production market activity and
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
other subjects consistent with the
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the department
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
we cooperate with other agencies in the
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
state and federal governments
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
the university of new hampshire
 
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
commodity and consumer groups
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
in the public interest in all who are
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
engaged within the state of any form of
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
agriculture or its allies
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
locations or advice on those activities
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
and of course we do
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
whatever else the legislature tasks us
 
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.269 align:start position:0%
whatever else the legislature tasks us
with

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
so to give you an idea of the scope of
 
00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
animal industry
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
and these are estimates because there is
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
no exact count
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
for any number of animals but we have a
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
fairly good idea
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
there are about three thousand and four
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
three hundred and four thousand dogs in
 
00:09:50.509 --> 00:09:50.519 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
332 000 cats
 
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
37 000 pet birds 21 000 horses
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
1.67 million poultry
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
in 34 000 flocks most of those are
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
small backyard blocks are only a few
 
00:10:12.389 --> 00:10:12.399 align:start position:0%
large commercial operations 33 000
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
cattle just about 7 000 pigs
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
just under 5 000 goats 1500
 
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
deer elk in bison and about 2 500
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
llamas in our pockets so a lot of
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
animals to keep track of
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
who our constituents of course the 1.3
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
million people in the state in about 521
 
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:36.870 align:start position:0%
million people in the state in about 521
000

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
households there are about 4 100
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
farms reported in the census 2017 which
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
is down
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the animal industry division supports
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
and promotes agriculture and serves
 
00:10:58.630 --> 00:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
consumers and business for the benefit
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
of public health which
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
primarily we do consider ourselves to be
 
00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:03.829 align:start position:0%
primarily we do consider ourselves to be
about

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
public protection in many different ways
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
so what health is
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
is one of the most important things that
 
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
the animal industry
 
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
really is does what they do to try to
 
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.470 align:start position:0%
really is does what they do to try to
protect

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
a healthy environment in the economy
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
and that control or attempt to prevent
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
and control contagious and infectious
 
00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
diseases of livestock and poultry
 
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the public health in
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
why do we regulate animal health in
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
zoonotic diseases we're very concerned
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
about that that's
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
you know if we know or believe that
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a good possibility
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
that the current pandemic organ came
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
through zoonotic diseases so that's a
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
of ours food safety particularly now
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:03.279 align:start position:0%
fisma which there's a bill on that later
 
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the day
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:start position:0%
so health risks there are 1400 pathogens
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
known to affect humans
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
and 60 percent of those are dramatic

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
core mission of animal industry is to
 
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:44.560 align:start position:0%

a lot of people think that we have

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
the animal
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
conditions but people who often call us
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
thinking that we have the primary
 
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.829 align:start position:0%
thinking that we have the primary
response

00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
for that or do not we run the state
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh spay and neuter program which is very
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
important i'll get into some
 
00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
statistics on that a little later dr
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
crawford is a
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
ex-official member of the board of
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
veterinary medicine and
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
thankfully that the oversight of
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
that board has been moved over into
 
00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
licenses office of professional
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
licensure which
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
is a big relief to me
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
terms of people thinking that i actually
 
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:15.189 align:start position:0%
terms of people thinking that i actually
had

00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
so of course on the administrative side
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
um budget rulemaking
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
they have administrative hearing
 
00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:33.189 align:start position:0%
they have administrative hearing
processes

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
personnel management
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
there's a prescription drug monitoring
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
program advisory council with martin
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
crocker is part of
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
part of the governor's commission on
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
and those are just a few of the things
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
greatest challenges we face as a
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
department particularly
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
i think in animal industry is the
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
resources do not match
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
the jobless when i took over this job
 
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.509 align:start position:0%
the jobless when i took over this job
from

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner merrill she referred to us
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
as being in
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
triage we are a little better
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
now having most of our positions built
 
00:16:18.069 --> 00:16:18.079 align:start position:0%
but we are still in triage mode in some
 
00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:19.829 align:start position:0%
but we are still in triage mode in some
areas

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
so we are constantly
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
having to determine what is the most
 
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.269 align:start position:0%
having to determine what is the most
important

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.440 align:start position:0%
i think one of the most important on our
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
substantial non-agriculture and time
 
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.269 align:start position:0%
substantial non-agriculture and time
resources

00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
really are the pet vending expectations
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
as i think we all know
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the law was changed and reduced the
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health certificates
 
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
from 50 to
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
25 which is put a big strain on
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
on the department we only receive one
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
additional person so we are really in
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
failure mode and i told
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the governor at that
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
time that
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
we would be in failure mode this program
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
would eliminate a number of resources
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
we're doing the best that we
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
talk about database in a while
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
i know i've got to speed up a little bit
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
although i don't
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
stand a little late i don't know if i
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
get my full half hour or not
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
but uh you know where we're
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
falling short besides uh pet been
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
growth with a number of small scale
 
00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:45.190 align:start position:0%
growth with a number of small scale
stakeholders

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
pigs most people in many cases have
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
little or no husbandry or disease at all
 
00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
so that we have to do a lot of education
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
in that area
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes we don't even
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so to decide what we do based on the
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
list of
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
things known we can't do them all we
 
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
ask is it a core mission of the
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
department is it a food safety issue
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
does it involve a zoonotic disease does
 
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:15.909 align:start position:0%
does it involve a zoonotic disease does
it

00:18:15.909 --> 00:18:15.919 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
evolve a threat to the state's economy
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
and prioritize based on three tiers
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
needs attention today
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
needs attention this week needs
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.789 align:start position:0%

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
the animal population control program
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
which is the
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
spay and neuter is rsa 437a and the
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of this program should be to
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the population
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
of unwanted and straight dogs and cats
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
by encouraging the owners of dogs and
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
cats to have them permanently sexually
 
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
cats to have them permanently sexually
sterilized

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
sterilized
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
thereby reducing potential threats to
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
the public health and safety

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
sources
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
i think we're doing fairly well with
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
there are about 3 000 surgeries a year
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
process 5 000 applications a year 60
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
veterinary clinics participate
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
monthly invoicing which i go through
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
every month that
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
sign after dr crawford has gone through
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount is being charged and
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
we feel about four to five thousand
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
phone calls
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
a year there's one person in that
 
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:43.750 align:start position:0%
a year there's one person in that
program

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously that's a lot of work
 
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh and obviously that's a lot of work
and

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
she's out on vacation sick day is the
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
work piles up is going to be very
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
difficult to catch up within animal
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
industry there are two veterinarians
 
00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
industry there are two veterinarians
force

00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
force
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that is the person in
 
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.310 align:start position:0%
so in addition to that is the person in
that

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
population so that's a lot of work for
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
very few people
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
to do one of the looming
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
risks and we just really became became
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
this last week is all the bersolosis
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
and tv testing has to be entered into
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
the federal database
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
the person who was doing that on the
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
federal level the feds were actually
 
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
taking our information and entering it
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
thankfully usda was doing it she died
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that person
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
is not being replaced it is now our
 
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do that
 
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
and that is going to really complicate
 
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
things for us because the risk of not
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
is not being able to import or export um
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
cattle and other livestock to and from
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
the state and so that's really
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
not an option to not do it but it's
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
going to take away from
 
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
from other things the division of
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
agricultural development
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
really is our marketing and they they
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
try to
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
promote agriculture and
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's really just there we have within
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
the division technically our
 
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
the division technically our
receptionist

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
receptionist
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
is uh part of that she feels an awful
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
lot of she feels all the questions for
 
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.710 align:start position:0%
lot of she feels all the questions for
everybody

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have one person devoted to
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
marco bullard
 
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
and the director herself
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
so not a very big division and not
 
00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
enough people we have a
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
part we tried to get a full-time
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
position to assist there
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
we got a part-time person and then
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
before we were able to build it we were
 
00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
given a uh
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
order to not until vacant position so
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
still not where we were like to be
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
the weekly market bulleted is our
 
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.549 align:start position:0%
the weekly market bulleted is our
official

00:21:56.549 --> 00:21:56.559 align:start position:0%
official
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
publication of record and we have 3 500
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
subscribers both on email and hard
 
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.669 align:start position:0%
subscribers both on email and hard
copies

00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
the division director manages the new
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire building at the
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
eastern states exposition
 
00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:16.559 align:start position:0%
by statute the building is actually
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
under the direct management control of
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of agriculture
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
somewhat unique that's not the case with
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
all the other buildings at eastern state
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
state buildings and so that is our our
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
sole responsibility
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
and of course eastern states when it is
 
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:35.750 align:start position:0%
and of course eastern states when it is
open

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the public draws about 0.5 million a
 
00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.149 align:start position:0%
to the public draws about 0.5 million a
year

00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of them go through through the new
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire building
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
the division also partners with the new
 
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire division of forest
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
lands and unh cooperative extension to
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
run the new hampshire farm
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
forest in foreign garden expo which of
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
course last year was
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
um was virtual this year would be
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
virtual again because that
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
would normally be coming up right about
 
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.390 align:start position:0%
would normally be coming up right about
now

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
we hope to be back live next year
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
the division has partnered with many
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
other organizations
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
in agencies who work on promoting and
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
um division director is a liaison with
 
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
um division director is a liaison with
over

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
over 30 different agricultural
 
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.149 align:start position:0%
over 30 different agricultural
organizations

00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
and assists actually in the
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
establishment of many of those
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
and the director is also our department
 
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
public information officer we published
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
many uh
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
different publications that are now
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
electronic and hard copy they go out to
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
agricultural events within the state of
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where they are what
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're going on
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
several maps about what what's going on
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
who's who in new hampshire agricultural
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
listing the heads of all the
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
organizations those things take on a
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
time one of the things that i had hoped
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
to accomplish when i was commissioner
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
was getting a uh a virtual map out there
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
on the internet and thankfully actually
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
cooperative extension has worked
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
on doing that and so what i thought was
 
00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559 align:start position:0%
needed is now really up and
 
00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
running through cooperative extension so
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
that you can go on there and find the
 
00:24:27.669 --> 00:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
various farms throughout the state of
 
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
course it's only
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
to the degree that farms participate in
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
that but it's i think
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
very helpful resources
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
forward the division of weights and
 
00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.909 align:start position:0%
forward the division of weights and
measures

00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
measures
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh really has a lot more responsibility
 
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
than i think many of us under understand
 
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:47.029 align:start position:0%
than i think many of us under understand
and

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
the beer caucus members will be uh
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
interested to know that we're
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that those
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
cans and bottles
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
are properly filled
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
and that's that's true of everything
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
that is sold by weights of
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
measures uh that you know
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
we we are supposed to primarily do so
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
when there is a complaint make sure that
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
what is in the packaging is is correct
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
we license everyone who
 
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
is responsible for maintaining those
 
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:21.510 align:start position:0%
is responsible for maintaining those
devices

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
devices
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:33.029 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
we license approximately 20 000
 
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
we license approximately 20 000
commercial

00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
devices they'll have to be licensed and
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
certified every year we don't do the
 
00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.430 align:start position:0%
certified every year we don't do the
certification

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
we audit the work and the people doing
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
the certification
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
um those 20 000 devices are owned by 2
 
00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.149 align:start position:0%
um those 20 000 devices are owned by 2
800

00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
800
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
businesses and
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
we license 945 waymasters that operate
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle scales
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are used commercially and all of
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
that includes
 
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.240 align:start position:0%
your propane delivery oil delivery
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
anything that is that is delivered
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
um that way we are responsible for
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
for those so there's a lot of um
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of areas that we have to uh
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
to deal with uh and that's a very
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
important consumer protection
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
issue because you know if somebody's
 
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.950 align:start position:0%
issue because you know if somebody's
scale

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
scale
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
is not certified correctly then the
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
person could
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
we don't care so much if they're getting
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
more than they're paying for but we are
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
very concerned that they're getting
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
less than they're paying for and we want
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that happens
 
00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:45.279 align:start position:0%
that all of that extends into the area
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
of cordwood as well
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the most difficult
 
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
things we deal with because
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
people argue oh i delivered that wood is
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
not all there anymore so
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's hard for us to know um
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
but we do deal with that
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
we kept up with all our testing this
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
year thankfully we were able to
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
put both pesticides in
 
00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
weights and measures when they were
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
testing or people who were
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
needed to be certified we were able to
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
use the auditorium at the brown building
 
00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:18.799 align:start position:0%
over at the gallon office bar
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
and test 15 people at a time it meant we
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
were doing a lot more testing than we
 
00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
normally did
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't something that we felt
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%

00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
get that done
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
we were able to keep up with that

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
so just to give you an idea here some of
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
the scale in that area
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's a lot the number of
 
00:28:44.669 --> 00:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
products in label review has increased
 
00:28:44.679 --> 00:28:46.230 align:start position:0%
products in label review has increased
141

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
141
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
in the last 20 years and 68
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
just in the last 10 years
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
so we review those labels to make sure
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
that the ingredients
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
are things that the legislature has
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
determined are
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
theory we should also be going out there
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
and process it
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
testing all of the ingredients in this
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
sample in each one of those products
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
that is not happening right now because
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
of staffing shortage
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough people you can see
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
the just reviewing those labels is
 
00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of time they're
 
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:25.990 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of time they're

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just stop on statistics
 
00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.149 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just stop on statistics
there

00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
well no i'm not going to i'm sorry on
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%

animal nutrition grants um
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
there were 18 landowners who applied
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
last year and primarily that's
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
from the newer pits and prevent runoff
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of grants we don't
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous amount of money
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
there we try to really prioritize those
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
and make sure that water quality
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%

61 seed companies and i will stop
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
there on that so pesticide control is
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
probably the division that we
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
cannot i'm almost done
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
a pesticide division
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
um probably the one area that we cannot
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
really fall down on have to keep up with
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
that because
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
obviously people are out there spraying
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
so we control
 
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
all the people who are licensed
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
do that and take that very seriously
 
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:36.070 align:start position:0%
do that and take that very seriously
because

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
you screw up there a lot of
 
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
environmental damage and a lot of you
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
have been damaged
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
so while i'd like to go more into that
 
00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
obviously the chairman's told me
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to wrap it up the final
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
division is plan industry
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
plus licensed plant dealers 400
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
ap areas and really is
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
trying to deal a lot with the um
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
invasive species and that's both in the
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
insect world and the plant world
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're trying to
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
do what we're trying to do before we
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
really get hit with a pandemic
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
is to partner with other agencies
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
and towns conservation commissions
 
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.710 align:start position:0%
and towns conservation commissions
really

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
hit hard with the invasive plants
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
anywhere down near hartford connecticut
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
it looks like a jungle
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i have sworn that when i leave this
 
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.710 align:start position:0%
and i have sworn that when i leave this
job

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
we're not going to look like in hartford
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
connecticut we have to
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
manage those invasive plants
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%

got last year and because of the
 
00:34:16.869 --> 00:34:16.879 align:start position:0%
pandemic we weren't able to study it
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
properly um
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
and it is a topic that i confess i have
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
not actually
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
studied as thoroughly as i um needed to
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh putting resubmitting the bill uh so
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh this year's bill is very similar to
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
the problem that the bill seeks to solve
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire agricultural
 
00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:39.430 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire agricultural
producers

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
producers
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
have had difficulty in competing for
 
00:34:45.109 --> 00:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
competing effectively for usda
 
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:46.800 align:start position:0%
value-added producer
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
grants because the program requires a 50
 
00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
grants because the program requires a 50
50

00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
50
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
match and uh that can be substantial
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
hurdle for a smaller beginning farmer
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
neighboring states have programs that
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
assist farmers in meeting the match
 
00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:03.349 align:start position:0%
assist farmers in meeting the match
requirement

00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
but we don't and farmers in in our
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
neighboring states have had much better
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
luck in
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
receiving these grants uh the intent of
 
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.349 align:start position:0%
receiving these grants uh the intent of
this

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to create a
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
to help new hampshire farmers compete
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
more successfully
 
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
for these grants in the course of
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
preparing the bill
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
i did some homework and the result of
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
that homework
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
is that i think this bill needs more
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
work before it can really go forward
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
but that the bill does really uh
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
but if we eventually if we get the bill
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
through it will fill a need that is
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
really there
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh so i think it might be uh
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
it might be appropriate for us to retain
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
this bill and
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
amend it so that it can really fulfill
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
its attend intent appropriately
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
i believe we have representative mick
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
williams with us online
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
and she's had some uh some experience in
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
applying to
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
this grant uh so i uh hope that she'll
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
be able to share some of her insights i
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
know she sent us
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
um an email with uh with some data in it
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'll close my testimony
 
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:15.510 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
representative pearl we're not able to
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
hear you could you move closer to the
 
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.710 align:start position:0%
hear you could you move closer to the
microphone

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
how about if i turn it on i bet that
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
would help
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
we're still not able to hear you um is
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm ready okay i can try moving it
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
a little closer how's that
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's better much better yes all right
 
00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
now thank you representative bixby uh
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
next we
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
will call uh representative mick
 
00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:19.349 align:start position:0%
will call uh representative mick

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
excellent all right um hi everyone my
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
name is representative rebecca
 
00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:24.710 align:start position:0%
name is representative rebecca

mcwilliams
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
um my family owns and runs the lewis
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
farm here in concord
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
and we've been doing so since 2016.
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
we also have farm mentors bob and cheryl
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
perkins who run autumn view farm in
 
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
perkins who run autumn view farm in
pittsfield

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
pittsfield
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
so the story i'm going to tell you is a
 
00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:43.359 align:start position:0%
story of two farms
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
um so we we at the lewis farm
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
have been slowly working our way up from
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
doing a csa we're an all-vegetable farm
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
we've been working our way up from doing
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
a csa to hoping to do sales
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
at local grocery stores
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
our mentors bob and cheryl have been
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
doing sales at grocery stores for about
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
20 years so they're a little bit more
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
savvy than we are on this
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
specific topic um so
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have been very aware of the
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
value-added producer grant
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
both farms have been bob and cheryl
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
because a lot of their large squash
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
products that they grow
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
they actually need to send off farm to a
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen for
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
processing namely as soon as you chop up
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
the squash
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you're ready to package it and sell
 
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
it to
 
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
a supermarket it has to be done in a
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
so for them it makes a lot of sense to
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully apply for and get one of these
 
00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.670 align:start position:0%
hopefully apply for and get one of these
grants

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
in order to put a commercial kitchen on
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
their farm property
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
so they can chop up their large volume
 
00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:53.119 align:start position:0%
squash i mean we're talking about
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of pounds of
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
squash that they grow
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
rather than shipping it offsite for
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
packaging and then sending it out to the
 
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:00.630 align:start position:0%
packaging and then sending it out to the
supermarkets

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
supermarkets
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
um so they were really excited when they
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
saw in the market
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
bulletin um that there were two farms
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
awarded in 2020 um both got the 250 000
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
um producer grant
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh and both seem to be related um
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
obviously value-added means that you're
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
not just selling raw produce you're
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
doing something to it
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we we have kind of been this
 
00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:27.750 align:start position:0%
uh so we we have kind of been this
supportive

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
relationship where my husband and i are
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
the younger farmers we're the ones going
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
online and doing the research
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
and bob and cheryl are the savvy farmers
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
who've been farming for 20 years and
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
know how to make things grow
 
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
and also how to get it to market so um i
 
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
and also how to get it to market so um i
i

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
did a whole bunch of research on the
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
value-added producer grant program
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
just to kind of get a sense of okay what
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
do we need to do to apply to get this
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
amazing 250 000
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
grant um so my research
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
turned up that really the way
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
program works is that usda insists that
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
you provide a fifty percent
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
match so obviously you would need to be
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
a fairly established business to come up
 
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
with another hundred twenty five
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars even if that's a bank
 
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars even if that's a bank
loan

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
loan
 
00:40:14.069 --> 00:40:14.079 align:start position:0%
in order to end up with 375 really
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's the goal
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
um to do the producer grant program
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so for bob and cheryl that's probably
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to be out of reach they don't
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
really have
 
00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
the the means to get at another 125
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
000 but other states do have
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
programs that provide either
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
very low or no interest loans or
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
matching funds to help farms actually
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
achieve this usda grant
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
so i can see why this legislation as
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
proposed makes a lot of sense because it
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
helps the farm get over that 50 percent
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
match hurdle and certainly there are
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
other ways to structure it
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
but from my perspective i think that
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
that really is a hurdle if you want to
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
do something like a commercial kitchen
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a huge addition to your
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
existing facility
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
coming up with 50 may be a lot
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
just a little bit more background so my
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
family farm
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
we were looking at doing one of their uh
 
00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:13.270 align:start position:0%
we were looking at doing one of their uh
study

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
sort of planning grants which is the
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
lower cost
 
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
seventy five thousand dollars so we
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
would really need to come up with 37
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
500 for the match um that seemed like we
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
could probably do it
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
but um considering the current situation
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
with covid
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
and some changes in the market we are
 
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.790 align:start position:0%
and some changes in the market we are
hesitant

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
hesitant
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
to to put that much capital on the line
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
and take the risk to do a commercial
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
small commercial kitchen at our own farm
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about doing canning
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of tomatoes so logically
 
00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
next step for us would be tomato sauce
 
00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's obviously more money in tomato
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
sauce and it keeps a lot longer
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
than trying to sell raw tomatoes through
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
the csa or to the public at our farm
 
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:56.790 align:start position:0%
the csa or to the public at our farm
stand

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
stand
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
so this is just a tale of two farms that
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
are kind of looking at this vapg
 
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
from usda and saying wow that's really
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
great money we'd love to get at it
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
but um financially the obstacle to get
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
to that 50 percent match has just been
 
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.150 align:start position:0%
to that 50 percent match has just been
significant

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
and so i wanted to provide that
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
testimony so you could understand the
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
background is it is a significant hurdle
 
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:18.069 align:start position:0%
background is it is a significant hurdle
um

00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
for farms who really aren't making a
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
whole ton of money doing what we're
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
doing but we know we could make more
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's just how do we bridge the gap so
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take questions but i
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
thought i would at least
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
provide some context for this thank you
 
00:42:31.359 --> 00:42:32.390 align:start position:0%
provide some context for this thank you
representative

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands all right
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
all right next up we will have robert
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
johnson from the new hampshire
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
we got you now go ahead great thank you
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%

and for those of you new to the

committee let me give you a few
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
sentences about what farm bureau is
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
we're a non-profit federation
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
established in 1916 of new hampshire's
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
10 county farm bureau organizations
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
we consist of nearly 2 thousand new
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire farm families
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
and over a thousand supporting members
 
00:43:43.119 --> 00:43:44.309 align:start position:0%
and over a thousand supporting members
statewide

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're a general farm organization where
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
members establish policy and direction
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
through a member-driven policy
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
development process
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation as as
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
alluded to was initially introduced last
 
00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.230 align:start position:0%
alluded to was initially introduced last
session

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
it was introduced by representative
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
david luno from hopkinton
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
and he did it at the request of one of
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
our members in and
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
took um kentucky creamery in hopkinton
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
and their concern was they had just put
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
in a
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
a dairy bottling facility milk bottling
 
00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
a dairy bottling facility milk bottling
facility

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
and they felt that they were
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh disadvantaged a bit in that
 
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
they were competing against producers
 
00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.109 align:start position:0%
they were competing against producers
from

00:44:29.109 --> 00:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
other states primarily vermont because
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the way
 
00:44:35.109 --> 00:44:35.119 align:start position:0%
usda rural development is set up new
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire and vermont
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh basically share an office and and uh
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
again he felt without where vermont
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
producers they could access
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
state funding in new hampshire he could
 
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.630 align:start position:0%
state funding in new hampshire he could
not

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh so that was that was how this was
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
initiated uh uh on the at the onset i
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
want to say that
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of the concept but as
 
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:57.750 align:start position:0%
we are supportive of the concept but as
as

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
representative bixby said we we also
 
00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.430 align:start position:0%
representative bixby said we we also
believe

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
it needs more work you need more
 
00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
it needs more work you need more
information

00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
to give you a little background on the
 
00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:08.550 align:start position:0%
to give you a little background on the
the

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
the grants the the value-added grants
 
00:45:11.359 --> 00:45:11.829 align:start position:0%
the grants the the value-added grants
are

00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
can be used by a
 
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
producer uh towards towards
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
adding value to a commodity and and to
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
give you some idea
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's where uh a a product is undergoing
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
a change in physical state like a fruit
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
to a jam
 
00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
marketing or segregation of a of a
 
00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
product special characteristics uh such
 
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:40.950 align:start position:0%
product special characteristics uh such
as

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
organic grass-fed local that type of
 
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.390 align:start position:0%
organic grass-fed local that type of
thing

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
or it could be where a product is being
 
00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
aggregated and marketed
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
as a locally produced food like a buy
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
local campaign or a state branded
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh branding campaign
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
or or also it is eligible producers are
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
if they're linking a farmer with a local
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
or a regional supply network such as a
 
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
farm to school
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
program so um generally the grants range
 
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
in the range of 50 to 250 000
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
though they they can be less uh uh
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
than that and they are in a couple of
 
00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:22.710 align:start position:0%
than that and they are in a couple of
forms

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
they're in the form of a working capital
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
grant or in the form of a planning of
 
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.470 align:start position:0%
grant or in the form of a planning of
feasibility

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
feasibility
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
and most common in order to receive that
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
working capital grant you
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
first have to have have gone through a
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
planning and
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
feasibility uh portion um
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
my understanding with the grants is that
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
they as
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
as we've said i think both speakers have
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
said they're matching
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
but on the producer end that that
 
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
that half uh half of that funding can be
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
in sweat equity
 
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:55.839 align:start position:0%
so for example if there's a uh say it's
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
a fifty thousand dollar grant
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
the producer is responsible for the uh
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh twenty five thousand and and half
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
of that can be in
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
in in uh sweat equity uh meaning the
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
owner's time and after that type of
 
00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
owner's time and after that type of
thing

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
a little background on again the
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh usage i guess of the grant
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i found data for
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
five year period from 2014 through 2018.
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire we had nine uh nine
 
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.750 align:start position:0%
and in new hampshire we had nine uh nine
recipients

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
recipients
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
of grants over that five year period in
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
vermont there were 17 recipients
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
and for further comparison purposes in
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
maine there were 24 and in massachusetts
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
10. 10. now you looking at the
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
difference in maine
 
00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire and vermont again 9 to
 
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:43.910 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire and vermont again 9 to
17.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
you got to remember that in new
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire according to usda stats
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we have just over 4 000
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
farms well
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
vermont is 6 800. so there's a little
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
difference there
 
00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:57.160 align:start position:0%
and and then in some years like over the
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
2017-18 period in new hampshire we
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
received four
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
but in vermont they received two so i i
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
just think we need to take
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
take a closer look but where where
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
we in particular farm bureau that what
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that we see or
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
questions we have is
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
why tie this this money to just the usda
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
value added program
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
why couldn't there be a fund that that
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
any value added
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
uh producer for whatever purpose could
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
could access
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and when when i know when when uh
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
this grant was initially uh thought of
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
it was really seen as just a small
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
porsche just uh
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
just uh like you might say uh uh yeah a
 
00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.549 align:start position:0%
just uh like you might say uh uh yeah a
uh

00:48:36.549 --> 00:48:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
a uh a micro grant talking in uh some
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
under ten thousand dollars we're not
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
looking at some as large as
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
usda another question is is the
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture the best place
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:51.839 align:start position:0%
um should it be at another agency
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
and um again the the the the other
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
pieces i think we
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
there used to be more information found
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
on this what what are the issues and
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
and what are the obstacles and in in the
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
interest of time mr chair i'll leave it
 
00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
at that and i'm always available for
 
00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.270 align:start position:0%
at that and i'm always available for

or to seek further information for the
 
00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:10.309 align:start position:0%
or to seek further information for the
committee

down and
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
take a look at our our sound system it's
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
really hard for us to hear
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's not clear at all very garbled

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the animal database so i'm going to
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh call on representative peter bixby
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 527 i'm sorry
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
um no actually it's 5 32. oh what
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i got it 5 32. yeah
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
627 was the last one uh so
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh for the record i'm representative
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
peter bixby
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
stratford district 17 representing dover
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
and somersworth
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um i am also a member of the ranking
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
member of this committee
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
so uh the uh
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
the animal database bill is a request
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
from the department of agriculture
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
markets and food and the core issue
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
is how animal health certificates are
 
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.670 align:start position:0%
is how animal health certificates are
handled

00:59:15.670 --> 00:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
handled
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to be presenting uh some
 
00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to be presenting uh some
background

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
and a little bit of history and a brief
 
00:59:21.359 --> 00:59:22.870 align:start position:0%
and a little bit of history and a brief
uh

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
a brief introduction to what the bill is
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to be doing
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper is going to be uh
 
00:59:28.319 --> 00:59:28.950 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper is going to be uh
presenting

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
more about the nuts and bolts of the
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
program and
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian stephen crawford is
 
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
state veterinarian stephen crawford is
uh

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
also going to be available to present
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
his perspective on some of these um some
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the some of the issues
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
so what i want to start out with
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
is what is a health certificate a health
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
certificate is
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
it issued by a veterinarian after
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
inspecting a dog cat or ferret and it
 
00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.470 align:start position:0%
inspecting a dog cat or ferret and it
certifies

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
certifies
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
that to the vets best knowledge an
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
animal is uh
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
that is offered for transfer or sale is
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
healthy at the time of inspection
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
and that certificate is good for 14 days
 
01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.710 align:start position:0%
and that certificate is good for 14 days
one

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
common point of confusion is that
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
there's also something called a
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
certificate of veterinary inspection
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's a federal document that you need
 
01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
to take animals across state lines for
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
things like dog shows
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh or or fares or that sort of thing or
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be selling across
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
state lines
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
those are sometimes referred to as
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
health certificates and they are
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
completely different from the health
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
certificates that are being dealt with
 
01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
so there are three purposes for
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
the health certificates uh that we're
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
dealing with here
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
one is to assure the purpose the
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
purchaser of the animal's health
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
it also a second purpose is to allow for
 
01:00:49.109 --> 01:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
the return of the animal
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
if it is discovered to be health healthy
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
unhealthy within
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of weeks and
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
the third purpose is uh
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
that the health certificate serves as a
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
record of transfer
 
01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
until 2017 health certificates were
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
required to be sent to the department
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
and when they got there they were stored
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
in printer paper boxes because there was
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
no proper filing system
 
01:01:18.549 --> 01:01:18.559 align:start position:0%
no staff to create such a filing system
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
and no
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
staff to handle uh the
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
the certificates in an organized way
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
in 2017 there's a statutory change made
 
01:01:32.789 --> 01:01:32.799 align:start position:0%
in the trailer budget bill that made uh
 
01:01:32.799 --> 01:01:34.870 align:start position:0%
in the trailer budget bill that made uh
certificates

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
made submission of the certificates to
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
the department optional
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
and this was because the the department
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a mechanism to handle
 
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
didn't really have a mechanism to handle
them

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh in 2019 uh statutory changes made in
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
the trailer budget bill
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
changed um or removed the definition of
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
commercial kennel
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh which had been used uh to determine
 
01:01:59.029 --> 01:01:59.039 align:start position:0%
which breeded
 
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
breeders needed to be vet needed a pet
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
vendor's license
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
and it allowed um that that um
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
commercial kennel definition also had an
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
exemption for
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh small breeders uh who would uh breed
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
fifty puppies or ten litters uh the
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
the changes in the trailer bill changed
 
01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.109 align:start position:0%
the changes in the trailer bill changed
the

01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
removed that commercial kennel
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
definition and then
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
it changed the pet definition so that
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
the threshold for requiring a pet vendor
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
license was
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
selling 25 or more dogs
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh and this created a need to be able to
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
track health certificates better
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh but we the submission of them is
 
01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:42.069 align:start position:0%
uh but we the submission of them is
still

01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
optional which makes it very hard to
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
track them
 
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh in discussing this problem with uh
 
01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and the state bets
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed that the most labor-efficient
 
01:02:55.029 --> 01:02:55.039 align:start position:0%
approach would be to create a database
 
01:02:57.109 --> 01:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
into which veterinarians directly enter
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
the health certificate information
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
it also seemed that would be beneficial
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
to deal with rabies
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
certificates in the same way in order to
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
provide the state bet with a better
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
overview of vaccination data
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
and to uh provide municipal clerks and
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
veterinarians an easier way to deal with
 
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
veterinarians an easier way to deal with
them

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
last year's bill hb 1627 was designed to
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
it went through multiple revisions to
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
strengthen the security and workout
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
finances and was passed by both the
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
house and the senate
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
but was part of an omnibus bill that the
 
01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
hb 532 as introduced
 
01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
is the version that the senate omnibus
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
bill contained last
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
last june because of changes in
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
circumstances it's become clear that
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
this bill that a bill that just focuses
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
on health certificates
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
is more appropriate at this time i've
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
that narrows the scope of the bill to
 
01:03:57.750 --> 01:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
only animal health certificates
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
removes all fees from the bill
 
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
adds a sentence to the confidentiality
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
penalty section
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying that there is a uh if a
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
person is charged with a violation
 
01:04:11.510 --> 01:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
that person could also face a physical a
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
civil suit
 
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh removes land language allowing the
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner to pay back the ipm and
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
scale funds from the animal database
 
01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.309 align:start position:0%
scale funds from the animal database
fund

01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
and adds a 250 000 appropriation in the
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
second year
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
of the biennium to cover maintenance
 
01:04:26.559 --> 01:04:28.630 align:start position:0%
of the biennium to cover maintenance
costs

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:28.640 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
so once amended what the bill is going
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
will do
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
is uh it will direct the department to
 
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
contract with the vendor
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the design creation deployment and
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing management of
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
the database such that the veterinarian
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
will will
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
be able to directly upload health
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
certificates and the department will be
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
able to manage the data
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
to determine whether transferees of
 
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.950 align:start position:0%
to determine whether transferees of
animals

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
animals
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
meet the threshold requirement to be
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
considered pet vendors
 
01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh it will put in place strict
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
confidentiality requirements which will
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
limit access of the database on
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
a need to know basis and put criminal
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
and civil penalties in place for
 
01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.789 align:start position:0%
and civil penalties in place for
violation

01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
violation
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
it will define animal health certificate
 
01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
as a record in the database
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
and make changes to current animal
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
health certificate statutes
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
that reflect this definition it will
 
01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
clarify health certificate waivers for
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
animals that fail
 
01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:26.079 align:start position:0%
the health inspection for a
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
non-contagious health problem
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
it will establish the funding it will
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
establish the funding
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
for the development and deployment of
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
the database from existing department
 
01:05:37.359 --> 01:05:38.309 align:start position:0%
the database from existing department
funds

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
and it will request an appropriation for
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing maintenance in the second year
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
of the biennium
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
i got a email from the state
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
veterinarian steve crawford
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
um shortly before this
 
01:05:55.589 --> 01:05:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh hearing and uh
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
he uh said he meant he mentioned that
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
there might be a potential issue with uh
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality section and um
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to enforce the
 
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh the statutes regarding um whether per
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
a person might be in violation and uh i
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
believe he's going to be testifying
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
um in in the near future and i just like
 
01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:23.510 align:start position:0%
um in in the near future and i just like
to

01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that he um comments on that
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
and um he also mentioned that the term
 
01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:32.799 align:start position:0%
health certificate might be
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
better you there might be a better term
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
for that and
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like him to cover also cover his
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
recommended language on that
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:44.839 --> 01:06:52.789 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um my question is is would this database
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
be limited to this specific parameters
 
01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
be limited to this specific parameters
only

01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
or is it a lot is it going to be
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
expanded at some point
 
01:07:06.549 --> 01:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay her question was uh is the
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
specifically too limited to this point
 
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.270 align:start position:0%
specifically too limited to this point
or

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
is it intended to be expanded into the
 
01:07:16.079 --> 01:07:17.510 align:start position:0%
is it intended to be expanded into the
future

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
future
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
um that is that's a question that the
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner can cover better than i can
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you another questions
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
you can actually well if they're having
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
a hard time hearing you maybe you want
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
to move closer to a microphone
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right representative thank you thank
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh my name is representative contra i
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
represent belknap seven
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i am introducing hb 438 it's
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
relatively confidentially of the animal
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
records database
 
01:08:37.110 --> 01:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
i have also brought forth an amendment
 
01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
i have also brought forth an amendment
um

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it just
 
01:08:42.709 --> 01:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
protect protects the confidentiality of
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
any animal records in the department of
 
01:08:45.199 --> 01:08:46.229 align:start position:0%
any animal records in the department of
agriculture

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
or any database that they may set up
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
but it will at this present if this
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
passed as is
 
01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
any records there would be protected
 
01:08:55.759 --> 01:08:56.789 align:start position:0%
any records there would be protected
from

01:08:56.789 --> 01:08:56.799 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
the right to know my amendment adds in
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
after the word information contained in
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the records of requests for information
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
from databases
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
and any other information that the
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
department might be authorized to manage
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
i wanted to make we wanted to make sure
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
that this covered anything
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
so that it wasn't just specific to
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
health certificates in case the database
 
01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
gets expanded we want to make sure that
 
01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
gets expanded we want to make sure that
people's

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
people's
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
information is confidential
 
01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
privacy is extremely important to people
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand that we need to know
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
certain things but people's personal
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
information needs very private and
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill attempts to do
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm open for questions mr chair
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative are
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
there any questions for
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
um i was just curious that if the
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
impetus for this bill was
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
sort of responding to the potential
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
imminency of having a statewide database
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
or is there another
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
reason that had to bring this bill there
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
is another reason uh representative
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking the question
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the reason i brought this bill is
 
01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
currently there is
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
not necessarily what some would consider
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
a database but they do have
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
information where if you call the
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture you could get
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
information pre-readily
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
from them and right now
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
that information is not protected
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
so we just want um so that was the
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
are there any additional questions for
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
question and thank you to rep combat for
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question as well
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
um can you define what you mean by
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
personal information is there a scope to
 
01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
that or do you have a vision for what
 
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
that or do you have a vision for what
that

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
entails actually
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
um actually under the right to know laws
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
the information should already be
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
protected but
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
personal data such as name you know
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
where you live
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
things of that nature things that would
 
01:11:29.189 --> 01:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
affect your privacy if they're out there
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
i mean if people need to know how many
 
01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.310 align:start position:0%
i mean if people need to know how many
dogs

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
or how many males or how many spays
 
01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's general information if they need
 
01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:38.790 align:start position:0%
that's general information if they need
to

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
know how many uh health certificates
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
were issued in a county that's general
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
information but if they
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
narrowed it down to say a specific town
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
and there was only one reader in there
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
well that would be too specific and
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
would not protect your privacy
 
01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question uh
 
01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative comptois uh would you be
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh work with me to uh roll this language
 
01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:14.149 align:start position:0%
uh work with me to uh roll this language
into

01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
the um the hb 532 so that as an
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
amendment rather than having it as a
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby i
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i think that i
 
01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
would like to keep this as a stand-alone
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill i
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
i think that maybe amending your bill to
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
include this language
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
but i still would like to keep this as a
 
01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.669 align:start position:0%
but i still would like to keep this as a
standalone

01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
standalone
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
do you see any more hands
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:10.709 --> 01:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i i guess i could
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh ask representative bixby as well
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
since we're kind of hearing hopefuls at
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm kind of not clear about uh how
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
the records these health certificates
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
are being
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
processed or searched or managed
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture at this
 
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.350 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture at this
time

01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
i mean do they have any kind of
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that they
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
when they receive these documents do
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
they just stick them in a box and put
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
them in a corner
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
or do they put that information
 
01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:47.189 align:start position:0%
or do they put that information
somewhere

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
on an electronic like you know in in
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
an electronic means did you know that um
 
01:13:57.510 --> 01:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
just may i thank mr chair representative
 
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
i think that the commissioner of ag can
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
speak more to that
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but i also want to say that a health
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
certificate just for people that don't
 
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.470 align:start position:0%
certificate just for people that don't
understand

01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
they are only good for 10 days after 10
 
01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.630 align:start position:0%
they are only good for 10 days after 10
days

01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're useless a health certificate
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
only is good for 10 days
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bixby did you
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
have anything further you'd like to add
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
um i think that the um
 
01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can cover that uh more
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
effectively in terms of
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
how he's planning on structuring and
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
using the database
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you plan to to testify
 
01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner do you plan to to testify
later

01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
i would like to but i think to the
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
specific question of how
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
they're managed now dr crawford is still
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the call
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
he would be able to answer that question
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
much better than i could all right dr
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
crawford would you like to
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
come up and answer that question now or
 
01:14:59.910 --> 01:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
happy to answer it now if you like me
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
all right please do thanks
 
01:15:05.830 --> 01:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
um well this the question i heard was
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
what do we do with the stuff
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
the health certificates we get now um we
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
have people go through them because they
 
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
only come in hard copy we have people go
 
01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
through them and we do enter them into
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
an access database that we keep here
 
01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
an access database that we keep here
just

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
because it's our obligation to track how
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
many animals a particular person is
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
transferred so that we know when they
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
hit that licensing threshold that's what
 
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.070 align:start position:0%
hit that licensing threshold that's what
the

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's been our understanding what the
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
legislature expects us to do when
 
01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
someone gets a licensing threshold they
 
01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
require a license and that's the only
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
way that we have to track how many
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
there are so uh historically we did just
 
01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
keep them in big boxes
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
um but now we actually take the
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
information when it comes in
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
or as quickly as we can after it comes
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
in and entered into an access database
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
that we use here in-house
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sure any further questions for
 
01:15:55.110 --> 01:15:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.149 --> 01:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative so
 
01:15:59.669 --> 01:15:59.679 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a different situation
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
this year because we're hearing two
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
bills at once
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
and um i have members that have signed
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
up our participants that are signed up
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
to speak on both bills so
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to work my way through the
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
list and it actually looks like we only
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
have one duplicate
 
01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh one member that's signed up to speak
 
01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
on both bills so i i think we'll be okay
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
just rolling through the list
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
all right next i will call on uh stacy
 
01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
ober from
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%

england for the american kennel club
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm extremely grateful for
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
the committees continued working
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
to amend this bill and get it right
 
01:16:51.669 --> 01:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of narrowing the focus and
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the department of agriculture
 
01:16:56.550 --> 01:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
to fulfill its responsibilities
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
in ensuring that only healthy animals
 
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
are transferred
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
and to also have the means to fulfill
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
its responsibilities under the changes
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
that were enacted in 2019
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i understand this is fluid in terms
 
01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.189 align:start position:0%
um i understand this is fluid in terms
of

01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
changes being made to the document i did
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony so i won't
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
repeat that
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
i do want to acknowledge the importance
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
of ensuring the protection of
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
individuals private
 
01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:28.560 align:start position:0%
information and that public records
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
exceptions for when individuals privacy
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
ought to be maintained i know that the
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire
 
01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
take personal privacy individual privacy
 
01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
extremely seriously and just wanted to
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
note that even in 2018
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
on a ballot you voted to amend your
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
to ensure individual privacy and
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
not intrusion by by government um
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
into personally identifiable information
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement and i appreciate you
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
continuing to work to ensure
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
that those protections are in place and
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
to make myself available to the
 
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
committee as you move through
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
making changes to the bill thank you
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
thank you stacey is there any questions
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
am i right okay next time we'll move on
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
nancy if you're out there could on the
 
01:18:42.870 --> 01:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
on the call could you raise your hand so
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see nancy so we'll we'll
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
skip on maybe we'll give her a chance
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
here before the end
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper did you want to
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
speak again yes i would like to
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
just speak i can speak to both of them
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn to
 
01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
dr crawford perhaps to correct me if i
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
say anything that's that's wrong um
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
first certainly we don't have any
 
01:19:20.950 --> 01:19:20.960 align:start position:0%
problem with the privacy
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
provision my recollection is that any
 
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:25.430 align:start position:0%
provision my recollection is that any
time

01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
that we have requests
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
that would involve any of the
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it's not
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
really a database but
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
relative to health certificates or
 
01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
anything we do not release
 
01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
personal information that's all that's
 
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.430 align:start position:0%
personal information that's all that's
redacted

01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
redacted
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody's wanted to call up and
 
01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
say how many health certificates did
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
howard pearl
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
have issue we would not give that
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
information i think that
 
01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
dr crawford can confirm that but i don't
 
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:58.470 align:start position:0%
dr crawford can confirm that but i don't
mind

01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
belts and suspenders but i think that
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
portion of it really
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
is belts and suspenders but i don't see
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
it as is harming any anything because
 
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that whatever we do
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
protects the privacy of it
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
of individuals so
 
01:20:18.310 --> 01:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
as far as i'm concerned that's fine the
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
the database itself
 
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
um and i think dr crawford said
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday we're dealing with something
 
01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:26.310 align:start position:0%
yesterday we're dealing with something
like

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
80 000 health certificates a year
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
we cannot manage those the best we can
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know they don't always get
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
entered and we're not able to um really
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
collate them in a way that's it's
 
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
terribly um
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
helpful and that's why we need this
 
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
helpful and that's why we need this
larger

01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
larger
 
01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
more sophisticated database so that
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
manually entering the information which
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
is what we're doing now as time allows
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why he says when it gets when
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the important thing right now is to
 
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:02.800 align:start position:0%
get this process rolling
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you not to get bogged
 
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
i would encourage you not to get bogged
down

01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the details because this is not going
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
to be a database
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
that would be going live anytime
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
soon i would be extremely happy if we
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
were able to go live before the end of
 
01:21:21.990 --> 01:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
i'm somewhat skeptical that that would
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
even happen
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a different
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
situation but we had a
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
database for weights and measures which
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately was developed by the
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
prisoners i don't know who thought it
 
01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:36.639 align:start position:0%
was a good idea to have
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
state databases developed by people who
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
were incarcerated but they did
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're stuck with in
 
01:21:46.709 --> 01:21:46.719 align:start position:0%
weights and measures before i became
 
01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:47.990 align:start position:0%
weights and measures before i became
commissioner

01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
doit was awarded the contract
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
to create the new database and to enter
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
the information and
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know that that is not
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
like what we're proposing
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
which is really starting fresh this was
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
going back and
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
making the two of them work together
 
01:22:07.270 --> 01:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to go live
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
within the first year of me being
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner i'm now in my third year
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we're still not live with that
 
01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
and we're still not live with that
program

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm skeptical
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
that it would happen anytime real soon
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
which would allow us
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
to work out any any kinks or issues that
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
i do frankly want to develop this
 
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:26.950 align:start position:0%
i do frankly want to develop this
database

01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that if the legislature should
 
01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.270 align:start position:0%
in a way that if the legislature should
authorize

01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
authorize
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
putting other information in there and
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
frankly you've heard about the tb and
 
01:22:36.550 --> 01:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
the bursellosis
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
those are things that would be very
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
helpful to have i'm not asking for
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
authorization for that
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure that we develop a
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
system that should the
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
legislature tell us we can do it that
 
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:48.639 align:start position:0%
we'll be able
 
01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
to do because we've got to went to the
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
21st century
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
or you've got to go back to the 20th
 
01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
or you've got to go back to the 20th
century

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
century
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
in the early part of the 20th century
 
01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
and give us a whole lot more people
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
to do what you're asking us to do we've
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
got this conflict here
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
of wanting us to do jobs but not giving
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
us the resources
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
to do it and if you don't want to give
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
us the resources to do it then take the
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
responsibilities away from us
 
01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
these are not things we have asked to do
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
these are things that
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
we are required to do either by the
 
01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
or by the legislature and we certainly
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the people to do everything
 
01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
without this database
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not terribly concerned about
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
what's what's in there right now in
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
terms of what's going to get entered if
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
you want to take rabies out
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine you want to you know
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
the one thing i'm concerned about is
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
having a
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism going forward to
 
01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
maintain this because these systems
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
are expensive to maintain we propose the
 
01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
are expensive to maintain we propose the
fee

01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
fee
 
01:23:58.149 --> 01:23:58.159 align:start position:0%
my understanding is there's hesitancy to
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
do that
 
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
well then that's got to be a general
 
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation
 
01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill and finance has
 
01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.110 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill and finance has
not

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
agreed to give us at least one year of
 
01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
the second year of the biennium
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
as as an assurance that we'll be able to
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
i got to tell you that i i can't in good
 
01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
i got to tell you that i i can't in good
conscience

01:24:19.590 --> 01:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
conscience
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
take a million dollars up to a million
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
dollars out of my existing
 
01:24:26.550 --> 01:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
funds and put it into a program
 
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
that is just would be a million dollar
 
01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.229 align:start position:0%
that is just would be a million dollar
paperweight

01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
paperweight
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
dr crawford gave me that that language
 
01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not taking credit but that's what it
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
would be because we have no ability to
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
do anything with it
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
so there's two parts to this we thought
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable to have a
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
a fee i don't care how you accomplish
 
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.030 align:start position:0%
a fee i don't care how you accomplish
that

01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
but we have to have that that funding
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
and we will continue no doubt
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
to we you
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
us together we'll continue to tweak how
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
this database works
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
going forward into the future but we've
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
got to get
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
this train out of the station and it's
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a long haul
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
to get it to the point where it's going
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
to be useful
 
01:25:10.629 --> 01:25:10.639 align:start position:0%
to anybody thank you commissioner i
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
actually have a question for you
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
this may be better suited for dr
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
crawford but uh if so you can
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
i can divert it to him when he speaks
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
what do you any do you have any sense
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
yet of how you're going to
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
implement the users putting data into
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
the database i know that i've
 
01:25:29.990 --> 01:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
heard in theory that you're going to
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
have the veterinaries themselves
 
01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
input these health certificates into the
 
01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.149 align:start position:0%
input these health certificates into the
system

01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
would would that be done would they have
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
access directly to the system or would
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
they send you a file that would be
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
uploaded to the system later on so that
 
01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.189 align:start position:0%
uploaded to the system later on so that
they

01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
the only access to the system would be
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
from the department themselves
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
no they they would be able to enter it
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
from their own devices they would have
 
01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
an access code but the only thing they
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
would ever be able to see
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
is what they personally entered into the
 
01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.870 align:start position:0%
is what they personally entered into the
database

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
so they couldn't go on and say all right
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put in howard pearl's name
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
and see how many health certificates
 
01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
he's got because i think he's using
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
other veterinarians and i want to find
 
01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:10.950 align:start position:0%
other veterinarians and i want to find
out

01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know if i'm doing no he would not be
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
they would only be able to do that tom
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
clerks you know
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be able potentially to enter
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
information but they would only be able
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
to see the information for their
 
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.149 align:start position:0%
to see the information for their
accounts

01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
the only ones who would be able to see
 
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
the whole picture
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be authorized users at the
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
so as a follow-up if the rabies is
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
removed from this bill then the town
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
clerks would actually have no
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
reason to access this database that that
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay if you limit it to that at this
 
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.030 align:start position:0%
okay if you limit it to that at this
point

01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
we would be just talking about the
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarians unless i'm missing
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
something dr crawford
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
but um yeah if we do it just to the
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
health certificates
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
and there has on that and we're not
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
proposing this here but we
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
we need to i think there's so much
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
confusion about health certificates
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
at some point we need to change that
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
that name because people do use the
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
cdi's as referred to as health
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
certificates and they think it is
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
at some point we'll be proposing we
 
01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
change the name probably to something
 
01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:15.430 align:start position:0%
change the name probably to something
like

01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
certificate for transfer so that people
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
are very clear that it's not
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
or anything else except transfer
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we didn't come up with
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
that idea until late in the process so i
 
01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to complicate it further but
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
we do recognize there's a problem there
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
and it does need to be
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
to be addressed are you willing to take
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
some questions from other members we
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
have a couple hands up all right uh
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative aaron did you have a
 
01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
um mr chair i
 
01:27:44.830 --> 01:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for testifying uh
 
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.229 align:start position:0%
and thank you so much for testifying uh
commissioner

01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
my question is i had heard earlier that
 
01:27:51.590 --> 01:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
the health certificates are only good
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
for 10 days
 
01:27:59.110 --> 01:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
so i am kind of i don't understand
 
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
what why you would have this information
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
like on a long term basis
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
because if i meant because
 
01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature has set the number
 
01:28:14.709 --> 01:28:14.719 align:start position:0%
of animals transferred at 25 at this
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
point it was 50 before
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
so you get a health certificate
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
on on puppy a then puppy b and so on and
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
so forth
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
now at some point the animals are not
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily transferred within that
 
01:28:30.149 --> 01:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
and the database would allow us to
 
01:28:33.510 --> 01:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
easily see
 
01:28:34.390 --> 01:28:34.400 align:start position:0%
all right there are two health
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
certificates on puppy a that only counts
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
as one health certificate
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
but when there have been 25
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
health certificates issued for
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
25 different animals that triggers
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
the pet vending licensure requirement
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
and that's why they have to get entered
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
because within that one year period
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
which the legislature has said as soon
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
as you
 
01:29:04.950 --> 01:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
the health certificates trigger that
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
that number
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
follow yeah and so
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
how do you track that now you have an
 
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
excel file or some sort of
 
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
file that the health certificates are
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
input into
 
01:29:21.350 --> 01:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
and then what happens they are manually
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
the technicians try to make sure that
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're not issuing
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
putting it in twice for the same animal
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that does
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
happen occasionally and when that
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
happens and we notify someone
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
that they've reached the limit
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
very often they'll come back and say no
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
you're miscalculating because puppy a
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
got issued
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
three l certificates we go back and
 
01:29:46.229 --> 01:29:46.239 align:start position:0%
verify that it's a very very time
 
01:29:46.239 --> 01:29:47.669 align:start position:0%
verify that it's a very very time
consuming

01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
consuming
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
process for a period of time
 
01:29:53.590 --> 01:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
the veterinarians were only sending us
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
health certificates
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
upon our request dr crawford can
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
correct me now i'm not sure if everybody
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
is sending them an
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
all now or just some are i don't know if
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
we're getting all 80
 
01:30:09.910 --> 01:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
000 sent in to us that's an overwhelming
 
01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:11.030 align:start position:0%
000 sent in to us that's an overwhelming
number

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
i tend to think we're not but i'd like
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
dr crawford to speak to that
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
dr crawford would you like to address
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
that sure if you'd like um
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know we are not getting all of those
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
in now that 8400
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
000 is the number of official house
 
01:30:25.199 --> 01:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
000 is the number of official house
crypts

01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
crypts
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
that if everybody was getting them as
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
the lower fires that would be expected
 
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
just to maintain the cat and dog
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
population new hampshire
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
on average lifespan and
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
not a growing or decreasing population
 
01:30:41.189 --> 01:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
of dogs and cats
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
no we don't get them all right now we
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
haven't we
 
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
request them from veterinarians who we
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
know a lot of them and some people just
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
send them in because they don't want to
 
01:30:50.239 --> 01:30:50.550 align:start position:0%
send them in because they don't want to
keep

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
keep
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
their files don't send those back we
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
review those
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
and um as the commissioner said
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
we do our best to assure that we're not
 
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
duplicating those when we enter them
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
and we enter them into our infant access
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
papers here as i said before
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're not getting all 80 000 um
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
at this point an electronic database
 
01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:10.950 align:start position:0%
at this point an electronic database
where

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
ideally we wouldn't have to touch those
 
01:31:14.709 --> 01:31:14.719 align:start position:0%
documents that would be entered by
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
an off by a veterinarian um
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
ideally they would all be entered and
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
then it's much easier for us to manage
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
your hundred thousand documents in the
 
01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:24.400 align:start position:0%
course of a year than it is
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
by hand um that's
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question i've got a
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
couple other comments but i'll wait on
 
01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:31.350 align:start position:0%
couple other comments but i'll wait on
those

01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
gonna let you guys ask other questions
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i'll bring you up
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
once we're done with the questions for
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh senator kennedy did you have a
 
01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:42.790 align:start position:0%
uh senator kennedy did you have a
question

01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
yes um so basically this database
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to work something and
 
01:31:48.719 --> 01:31:50.470 align:start position:0%
it's going to work something and
crawford

01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
crawford
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
i come from a large animal background so
 
01:31:56.870 --> 01:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
would it work like global vet like where
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
the client itself would log
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
in have all their animals in there be
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
able to print off the certificate if
 
01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.310 align:start position:0%
able to print off the certificate if
needed

01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then yeah so it's good you're not in
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
your head so it's going to be along the
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
same so
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
with people have been expressing concern
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
well if you include radius there are we
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for town clerks to
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
even have their job so now it's just
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
between the veterinary
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
and the state instead of the town being
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
in the loop on this one
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
um i don't know bitsby or whoever wants
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
to answer that probably
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
that's what um i'm happy to
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
mr chair commissioner but um
 
01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
let me know if you'd like me to sure go
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
ahead represent uh go ahead
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
the the proposed amendment
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
would take the rabies pieces out of it
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
um health certificates generally do not
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
go to the town clerk and they wouldn't
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
involve them
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be cutting the town clerk
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
out of a process that they're normally
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
the rabies process my understanding is
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
based on the amendment the rabies
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
process would stay as it currently is
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
rather than add it to this electronic
 
01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.629 align:start position:0%
rather than add it to this electronic
database

01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
thank uh commissioner and i think
 
01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a little
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
fundamental misunderstanding of you know
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
the rabies certificate
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
would be interrupt would be
 
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
under our original proposal would be
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
entered by the
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
veterinarian however when a person
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
went to the town clerk to register their
 
01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:33.990 align:start position:0%
went to the town clerk to register their
dog

01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
dog
 
01:33:35.750 --> 01:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
they would still have to have the hard
 
01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.350 align:start position:0%
they would still have to have the hard
coffee

01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
coffee
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
because the town clerk is not going to
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
have access
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
to who entered who
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
who entered the rabies certificate so
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's no change
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
on the town clerk's office but then the
 
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
licensure would be able to
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
to be entered that the dog had a rabies
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
certificate and was licensed in the town
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
that information is more readily
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
available to
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh to law enforcement et cetera um
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
but it would be do nothing to eliminate
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
the town clerk's role in this because
 
01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
theirs is about
 
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.669 align:start position:0%
theirs is about
licensure

01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any uh any additional
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner uh
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative comtel
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i have actually two
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
things that i wanted to ask thank you
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner for taking my question
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
the first one is it says that you um
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
department of ag personnel would have
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
access and others would have access to
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
the database
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
when you say other like who else would
 
01:34:42.239 --> 01:34:43.189 align:start position:0%
when you say other like who else would
have

01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
access to that database i'm not familiar
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
with that language and the last
 
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
time i looked at it i didn't recall that
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
because i thought it was
 
01:34:54.870 --> 01:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
others authorized by the commissioner
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps and i think that was just sort
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
of generic
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
language but um i don't know that that's
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
necessary perhaps the sponsor could
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
speak to that that wasn't language would
 
01:35:07.109 --> 01:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
request it but okay
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah call mr chair thank you
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
one other question
 
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
when we talk about 80 000 health
 
01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.709 align:start position:0%
when we talk about 80 000 health
certificates

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
are we including the health certificates
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
that are issued by the humane societies
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
and the shelters
 
01:35:23.669 --> 01:35:23.679 align:start position:0%
per year because they're not entered
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
into a database they're not required
 
01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
only veterinarians can issue health
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
certificates so we're talking about
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
health certificates
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
that are issued by veterinarians i don't
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
so dr crawford may be able to
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh to speak better to the issue than i
 
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
can but i'm not familiar with
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
with an exemption for
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
animals being transferred by shelters
 
01:35:54.550 --> 01:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
not having health
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
periods because it's all all about
 
01:35:59.910 --> 01:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
diseases really and making sure that
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
we're transferring
 
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
healthy animals dr crawford did you have
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
anything you could add to that
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're happy to um there is an exemption
 
01:36:11.350 --> 01:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
that falls somewhere between
 
01:36:13.030 --> 01:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative kumpo and
 
01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
the commissioner animal shelters are
 
01:36:16.239 --> 01:36:17.030 align:start position:0%
the commissioner animal shelters are
exempt

01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
from writing these official health
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
certificates for locally surrendered
 
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:21.669 align:start position:0%
certificates for locally surrendered
animals

01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
animals
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
so any animal they import into the state
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
has to come with that interstate
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
certificate of inspection that you heard
 
01:36:26.239 --> 01:36:26.870 align:start position:0%
certificate of inspection that you heard
about

01:36:26.870 --> 01:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
and has to get one of these official
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
health certificates before it is
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
made available to the public and we do
 
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
we do keep records of those when we get
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
them as well and we
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
we don't get all the health certificates
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are written at this point but
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
we do get some of the official health
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
certificates for those shelter animals
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
that have been imported and then
 
01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
then transferred out but the so there
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
are some
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
some dogs or cats transferred from
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
shelters that do require an official
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
health certificate but not all of them
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up i did have a
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
vote thank you mr chair thank you dr
 
01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
vote thank you mr chair thank you dr
crawford

01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
crawford
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question was when you say
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's 80 000 health certificates
 
01:37:06.629 --> 01:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
per year roughly being issued in the
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
state does that include those that are
 
01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:09.430 align:start position:0%
state does that include those that are
exempt

01:37:09.430 --> 01:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
exempt
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
does that never include the exact ones
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
that are exempt from having to send them
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
no it wouldn't it would not that's a
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
fair point no it would not um
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'd have to go back and look at the math
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know whether i when i did
 
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:23.750 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know whether i when i did
that

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago whether i um excluded
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
them or not but i would say
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
without knowing no it wouldn't include
 
01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:31.350 align:start position:0%
without knowing no it wouldn't include
those

01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
stuff yet thank you dr crawford did you
 
01:37:35.590 --> 01:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
have any further
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh comments that you wanted to put into
 
01:37:38.639 --> 01:37:39.910 align:start position:0%
uh comments that you wanted to put into
testimony

01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
i do um if if it's all right thanks um
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think the commissioner hit the nail on
 
01:37:48.390 --> 01:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
the head getting the process rolling and
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
sort of understanding the long-term
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
funding obligations of this system are
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
our primary interests um
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
in the i wanted to touch on
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
the records protection comment that i
 
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
had sent in the email this morning to
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative bixby when i looked
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment and it's um
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure why i hadn't noticed it
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
before and i apologize for not
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
so as written at least um
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
it would presumably prohibit law
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement from getting those records
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
or in the department from sharing them
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
without a court order
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
um when you look in the penalty
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
provision i
 
01:38:29.189 --> 01:38:29.199 align:start position:0%
apologize for averting my eyes i'm
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
looking at my other computer screen
 
01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:32.239 align:start position:0%
trying to pull up the language so i can
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
read it to you
 
01:38:38.310 --> 01:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
the penalty section in rsa437
 
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
the first penalty is a pet vendor who
 
01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.669 align:start position:0%
the first penalty is a pet vendor who
transfers

01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
animals without having a license to do
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
so as required by this chapter shall be
 
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
guilty of a misdemeanor
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's a criminal penalty that the
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislature currently has in statute
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
um the department doesn't have the means
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
or the authority to enforce criminal
 
01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.229 align:start position:0%
or the authority to enforce criminal
activity

01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
or criminal penalties the second
 
01:38:59.590 --> 01:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
provision is
 
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
administrative stuff and that's usually
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
what we use license um fines and other
 
01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.629 align:start position:0%
what we use license um fines and other
stuff

01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
so our approach
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
when we deal with these folks that are
 
01:39:09.119 --> 01:39:12.709 align:start position:0%
when we deal with these folks that are
approaching

01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
approaching the obligation to get
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
licensed we usually send them a
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
heads-up letter hey you're getting close
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
to what the law says you have to we have
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
to get licensed
 
01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
many most of them are amenable and work
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
some are not and some even after they've
 
01:39:30.310 --> 01:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
crossed that threshold they're resistant
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
to getting licensed
 
01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:34.719 align:start position:0%
so it it is our practice to only
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
communicate in writing with these folks
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
and after we've sent them
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
one or two of these warning letters that
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
you have to get licensed
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
we will commonly carbon copy that to
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
either the local police or animal
 
01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
control officer so they're aware
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's up to them whether or not they want
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
to pursue criminal activity
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
as proposed um
 
01:39:57.189 --> 01:39:57.199 align:start position:0%
these record protections would prohibit
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
us from doing that as my understanding
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm unclear i guess how
 
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
or if the criminal penalty would still
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
be warranted at that point
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i did i apologize for only noticing
 
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
yeah i did i apologize for only noticing
that

01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
when i read um the amendment this
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
morning and not
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
not picking it up earlier on in the
 
01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:17.830 align:start position:0%
not picking it up earlier on in the
process

01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you dr crawford i'm sure i i
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
apologize um
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
and i i just i read it too fast so there
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
is currently a record protection
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
provision in
 
01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
another chapter of law that we have in
 
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.870 align:start position:0%
another chapter of law that we have in
rsa436

01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
rsa436
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
that protects all uh animal records
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
animal health records
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
from public disclosure which
 
01:40:43.750 --> 01:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
again seems reasonable and has worked um
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
but that that exemption in 436 colon 6-a
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
goes on to say disclosure to local state
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
and federal officials is not public
 
01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
and federal officials is not public
disclosure

01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
and this exemption does not affect the
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
disclosure of information used in
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
reportable animal health investigations
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
under this chapter so
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
it protects them from the public but it
 
01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.189 align:start position:0%
it protects them from the public but it
allows

01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
allows
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
disclosure as appropriate to other
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
government officials and when there's a
 
01:41:08.719 --> 01:41:10.070 align:start position:0%
government officials and when there's a
um

01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
public health threat presumably so again
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's already some language in statute
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
and maybe that was
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
i was curious how the two of those would
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
work together as well apologies for
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
all right thank you dr crawford was oh
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative molly did you have a
 
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.390 align:start position:0%
representative molly did you have a
question

01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
certainly yes sir um i just want to make
 
01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure i understand the database
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
correctly and the need for the databases
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
if i understand this correctly
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the system when you were able to
 
01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.189 align:start position:0%
that the system when you were able to
just

01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh have a requirement for the animals to
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
protect yourself
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's correct we've been talking about
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
databases that we need within the
 
01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.109 align:start position:0%
databases that we need within the
department

01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
anyhow and it was obvious that we needed
 
01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.390 align:start position:0%
anyhow and it was obvious that we needed
to

01:42:02.390 --> 01:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:05.109 --> 01:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
modernize and we're trying to to figure
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
out we
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
you know we're stuck on this weights and
 
01:42:09.189 --> 01:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
measures one but they're we're going to
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
have to continue to do that
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
with all the divisions um this is one
 
01:42:13.679 --> 01:42:14.629 align:start position:0%
with all the divisions um this is one
certainly

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um that rose to the top because of the
 
01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.229 align:start position:0%
um that rose to the top because of the
change

01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
but the need was already there and there
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
are you know as
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
i said there are other needs i mean we
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
should be looking at putting in the tb
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
personalises so that we can you know
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
even when the feds were doing it it was
 
01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:31.030 align:start position:0%
even when the feds were doing it it was
still

01:42:31.030 --> 01:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of work that had to be prepared to
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
get the information to them
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
we need to modernize i mean we can't
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
think that we can
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
maintain a growing population
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
with a static number of employees and
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
more and more requirements so
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
yes this this has made it a crisis for
 
01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:50.229 align:start position:0%
yes this this has made it a crisis for
us

01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
we are in failure mode when it comes to
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
the pet vetting standards
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
and again the record will show that we
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
have said that
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
as soon as this was proposed that we
 
01:43:00.239 --> 01:43:01.270 align:start position:0%
as soon as this was proposed that we
cannot

01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
do what we've been asked to do we are
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
not doing what we've been asked to do
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
that we all sort of anticipate in this
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
coming year
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
as a stop gap is it cheaper to have a
 
01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.390 align:start position:0%
as a stop gap is it cheaper to have a
database

01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
or hire on a on a
 
01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know 10-year plan to at least get
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
over this
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
initial crisis thank you for the
 
01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:39.270 align:start position:0%
initial crisis thank you for the
question

01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
no no frank frankly
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um you know i'm not sure that when you
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
look at it that it's cheaper uh even in
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
in the short term certainly we could
 
01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
potentially get there quicker but
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
more expensively i don't know where the
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
money would come but
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
we also don't have any place to house
 
01:43:58.239 --> 01:43:59.270 align:start position:0%
we also don't have any place to house
people

01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
we literally are out of space at the
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
and by the way just because probably
 
01:44:07.430 --> 01:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
most people don't know it
 
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
we pay rent to administrative services
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
we pay a lot of rent to administrative
 
01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
we pay a lot of rent to administrative
services

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
so space isn't free um and then they add
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know administrative costs to
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
everything so
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
even in the short term it's not cheaper
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner uh representative
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
murray did you have a question i see
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
your hand is up
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
i did i have two separate questions so
 
01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:31.669 align:start position:0%
i did i have two separate questions so
uh

01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
i just to clarify with dr crawford
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
if i may um you were referring um in
 
01:44:38.159 --> 01:44:38.950 align:start position:0%
if i may um you were referring um in
your

01:44:38.950 --> 01:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
last testimony going just rewinding a
 
01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.310 align:start position:0%
last testimony going just rewinding a
moment

01:44:42.310 --> 01:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:44:45.109 --> 01:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
to the amendment for since we're looking
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
at both bills was that
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
438 that you were referencing the
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
question of how it would work with
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
no it was um representative bixby's
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that's the only one
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay i'm so thank you
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then my second question was with
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
regard to this
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
federal uh database or the versaillosis
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
and the tv requirement
 
01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
and do you have any further information
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
of whether you would be
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
adding this information to yourselves as
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
a department
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
to the federal database or are you
 
01:45:24.870 --> 01:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
required to take over it and
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
contain that information within the
 
01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:28.870 align:start position:0%
contain that information within the
department

01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:45:31.990 --> 01:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so the that's a fully separate
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
program than the one we're talking about
 
01:45:34.149 --> 01:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
here but if you
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge me just the
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
brucellosis and
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
tuberculosis information that every
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
state has to enter into this federal
 
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.709 align:start position:0%
state has to enter into this federal
database

01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
each state is obligated to get their own
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
information entered we've just been
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough for a long time to have
 
01:45:49.990 --> 01:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
our local usda folks do it for us
 
01:45:52.950 --> 01:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
um you heard the story as to as to why
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be able to happen
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
going forward and so we're trying it
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
um we've already signed up for for
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
training on entry into that database
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
me and another one of our staff so we'll
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
have to take that over at some point
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
here in the near future once we get
 
01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
trained and
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
are granted access to that database okay
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:14.950 --> 01:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
sure all right seeing no further
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
questions i'm going to
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
move on to uh looks like nancy holmes is
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
with us now
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
nancy are you able to unmute and present
 
01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.790 align:start position:0%
nancy are you able to unmute and present
testimony

01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
how's that we got just so we're
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
hearing both bills uh concurrently 532
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
and 438 and i have you listed as wanting
 
01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:34.229 align:start position:0%
and 438 and i have you listed as wanting
to

01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:36.550 --> 01:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
testify on both so i'm going to ask that
 
01:46:38.629 --> 01:46:38.639 align:start position:0%
you just put your comments together and
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
present them on both bills if you're
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
able to do that um
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
i i think so um on the
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
one that just has the um information on
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
how everything is going to be kept safe
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's the the first one i'm sorry i
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the number in front of me
 
01:46:54.950 --> 01:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
on that one i listed myself as neutral
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
because as far as i'm concerned
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
reading that bill and reading
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
53532 the
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no privacy possible
 
01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
with the current 532 bill so that was
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
why i felt neutral on the listing i
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
think there's some
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
wording that could be changed in that
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
one and you know taking out the rabies
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
access information because it's not
 
01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:21.109 align:start position:0%
access information because it's not
needed

01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
if you go with the amended version of
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
however i have seen the amended version
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
um of the of
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
where the hb 532 i've seen it
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
and i see some serious holes and
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
problems in it
 
01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
um and in general one of the things i
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to talk to you about is you've
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
all gotten my written testimony i know
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i i hold by that but what i wanted
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
to make clear was
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are ways to transmit data between
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
businesses or
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
governments or people whatever without
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
anybody logging into the other person's
 
01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
anybody logging into the other person's
database

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:48:01.430 --> 01:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's a decades-old technology it's used
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
to keep people out of each other's
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
systems and it's called electronic data
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
interchange or edi
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's easily looked up on the internet to
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
see how it works
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say that we wanted to use the
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
strict protocols that are found in edi
 
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
strict protocols that are found in edi
systems

01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
but what i would say is you can use the
 
01:48:22.390 --> 01:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
concept which is
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
i have a file i want to send to you i
 
01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
drop it off in a lock box
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
type location you pick it up you screen
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
it you determine that it's safe to add
 
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
to your database
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
and then yours your programs add it to
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
your database
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's no veterinarians logging into
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
the database
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's no um vendor pet vendors logging
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
into your database
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's just a transmission of data
 
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
the number of places in the bill that
 
01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:52.149 align:start position:0%
the number of places in the bill that
show

01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
show
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
that different people can log into the
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
database and do this and that and the
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
other thing
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
including others as the department
 
01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.070 align:start position:0%
including others as the department
determines

01:49:00.070 --> 01:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
determines
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
to me that means there's absolutely no
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
security whatsoever
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
for that database if everybody's going
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
to have their fingers in it it's going
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
to make it far
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
easier to hack i'd rather see the
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
department only
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
have be able to touch that database and
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
then have the systems where
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
information is transmitted into it be
 
01:49:19.599 --> 01:49:21.430 align:start position:0%
information is transmitted into it be
automated

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
automated
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
think of it like you uh how you pick up
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
food from a restaurant now
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
you don't go in the restaurant they
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
don't come into your house to deliver it
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
you have a secure location maybe your
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
parking lot and they drop it off with
 
01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.270 align:start position:0%
parking lot and they drop it off with
you

01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
um so that was um i wanted to kind of
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
get go over the
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
concept of edi with you for that
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
and i could say in the um bill there was
 
01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:44.950 align:start position:0%
and i could say in the um bill there was
still

01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
still
 
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
established fees um there was um
 
01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
um you know stills outlawing
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
outlining the bill itself outlining what
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
i think of is outmoded methods for
 
01:49:59.270 --> 01:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
transmission of data between
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
like veterinarians and the department
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
which nobody should be logging into that
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
database except the department when
 
01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
they're using it for reporting
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
or for maintenance among other things
 
01:50:11.830 --> 01:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to really reduce
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of costs because if you have all
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
those people touching that database
 
01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
they're all going to need tech support
 
01:50:21.589 --> 01:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know notice how much fun we've been
 
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
having with zoom
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
okay i include myself in that
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
um everybody is going to have at least
 
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
probably two people in their business
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
that's going to be
 
01:50:33.990 --> 01:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
wanting to access the database because
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
you can't just have one person do it
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to have a backup
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
person for when that person's out sick
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
all of those things you know combined
 
01:50:44.229 --> 01:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
the fewer people you have that have
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
programs that are directly accessing the
 
01:50:46.159 --> 01:50:46.870 align:start position:0%
programs that are directly accessing the
database

01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
the less tech support you have to deal
 
01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:50.470 align:start position:0%
the less tech support you have to deal
with

01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
anytime you make a update or or
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
change things the more people who are
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
using programs specifically to access
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
the database
 
01:51:02.950 --> 01:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
at um the department the more people
 
01:51:05.189 --> 01:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
will have to go through upgrades and
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
again tech
 
01:51:08.709 --> 01:51:08.719 align:start position:0%
support this is this isn't cheap stuff
 
01:51:08.719 --> 01:51:09.750 align:start position:0%
support this is this isn't cheap stuff
um

01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
so i i think you could really cut costs
 
01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:12.870 align:start position:0%
so i i think you could really cut costs
on

01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
on how much things will end up running
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the department in terms of getting
 
01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.639 align:start position:0%
things done
 
01:51:20.310 --> 01:51:20.320 align:start position:0%
and you may be able to easily cut the
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
number of personnel needed also
 
01:51:25.510 --> 01:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
simply by ruling out all the extra
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
access to the database
 
01:51:30.149 --> 01:51:30.159 align:start position:0%
and it's it's easily done i just i think
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the bill right now
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
is just you know it's not taking into
 
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:36.070 align:start position:0%
is just you know it's not taking into
account

01:51:36.070 --> 01:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
all of the security holes that it's
 
01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:40.229 align:start position:0%
all of the security holes that it's
creating

01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i have i have a problem with that i
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
don't have a pr i have a
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know of course i'm with everybody
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
else and having a problem on the rabies
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
information being in the database i
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to see it in there
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
i want to be able to walk into my town
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
and get my rabies
 
01:51:55.669 --> 01:51:55.679 align:start position:0%
have my rabies vaccination information
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
already there because my vet
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
sends it to the town that i live in
 
01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
and you know just get my licenses
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
without waiting for somebody to
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully log on to
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
a database at the state level and
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully be able to get that
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
information quickly
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
and hopefully be able to then input it
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
into the town system
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
um it's just it's making it too
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
complicated and i think
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
that kind of complication again it
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
leaves um
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
holes in the system all right i'd be
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions i think i've
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
covered pretty quickly everything i was
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
hoping to
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a bunch of nitpicky
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
things i saw on the amendment too but
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
that's the major stuff is that that
 
01:52:41.990 --> 01:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
security hole is gigantic
 
01:52:43.750 --> 01:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i say that from a background of
 
01:52:45.669 --> 01:52:45.679 align:start position:0%
computer systems
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you nancy are you willing to take
 
01:52:49.589 --> 01:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
any questions absolutely
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative dutsy has her hand up uh
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
are you able to unmute
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes i just did can you hear me yeah
 
01:52:56.480 --> 01:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
uh yes i just did can you hear me yeah
yes

01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay um uh thank you chairman pearl for
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh for allowing my question
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh miss holmes the question that i had
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh that the architecture of the database
 
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:08.870 align:start position:0%
uh that the architecture of the database
uh

01:53:08.870 --> 01:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
should be put into statute
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that i believe it is right
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
now being put into statute because of
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
the way it is talking about how people
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
will access it
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
who will access it and so on
 
01:53:25.270 --> 01:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
um i think that that wording needs to be
 
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
out of there
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
so that um a level of secure system
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
could be created but the way it's in
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
here is it's got
 
01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's got veterinarians signing in to
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
look at health certificates after
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
they've already submitted them
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's got pet vendors including shelters
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
signing in to look at stuff
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the database that's not needed
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
they do these places may need to
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
transmit data to the database
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
but they don't need to access it
 
01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:55.669 align:start position:0%
but they don't need to access it
afterwards

01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
and the transmission can be done
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
securely instead of by somebody logging
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you thank you
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
any uh any other questions
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
do you see any other hands up all right
 
01:54:12.229 --> 01:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you nancy we appreciate you coming
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%

and just for those of you who haven't
 
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
heard me speak at prior hearings

i've been working with this organization
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is an american kennel
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
club affiliated non-profit organization
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
founded back in 1991
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
and we're here to represent the
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
interests of all pet owners
 
01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
we have a really robust community of
 
01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
breed clubs
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
kennel clubs dog and cap readers
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
veterinarians mushers hunters
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
and livestock guardian dog owners just
 
01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
for a little background
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
i have a few points to touch on i think
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
the conversation has been really great
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
today and a lot of good information has
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
been raised
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
well i do appreciate jas commissioner
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
jasper not wanting to get into the
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
details here
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of details in this bill
 
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of details in this bill
and

01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
some of them are critical details as
 
01:55:32.470 --> 01:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing today
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
i would be curious to understand how we
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
would stay involved moving forward if we
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
were to move forward without having
 
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:40.320 align:start position:0%
these detailed discussions
 
01:55:43.109 --> 01:55:43.119 align:start position:0%
and ensuring that everything is covered
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
especially at a security
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
and confidentiality level you're
 
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
obviously noticing a lot of questions
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
and concerns
 
01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
in that area our group has those as well
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm going to bring up a few specific
 
01:55:59.669 --> 01:55:59.679 align:start position:0%
points i did submit testimony to the
 
01:56:01.669 --> 01:56:01.679 align:start position:0%
committee so you should all have this
 
01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
as well and i'll likely follow up based
 
01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
on some of what i've heard today
 
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
if there's still some additional things
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
to cover one of the items that was
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
discussed was the two different types of
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
health certificates that are out there
 
01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
cvi being the one that is for interstate
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
travel or transfer as well as the
 
01:56:21.599 --> 01:56:22.310 align:start position:0%
travel or transfer as well as the
regular

01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
regular
 
01:56:26.070 --> 01:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
the discussion was around you know how
 
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:29.920 align:start position:0%
to differentiate
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
an actual health certificate for
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
transfer versus those who are just
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
obtaining them for travel and other
 
01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.270 align:start position:0%
obtaining them for travel and other
purposes

01:56:37.270 --> 01:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
and i don't think that utilizing cvi
 
01:56:43.350 --> 01:56:43.360 align:start position:0%
certificates versus the general health
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
certificates is going to work
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
since cvi can be used for both
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
travel and transfer purposes so we do
 
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:52.709 align:start position:0%
travel and transfer purposes so we do
have

01:56:52.709 --> 01:56:52.719 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
both of those health certificates that
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
can be used for transfers
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
i did include in my testimony some ideas
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
about data being submitted
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
where maybe there's an indicator
 
01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
that the veterinarian would identify
 
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
if this is a transfer health certificate
 
01:57:14.790 --> 01:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
or if it was for travel or other
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
or a duplicate we do have duplicates
 
01:57:18.870 --> 01:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
01:57:21.189 --> 01:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually a 14 day window
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
that health certificates are good for
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
and if you don't sell your puppy for
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
example within that 14-day period you
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
would need to obtain another health
 
01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:31.910 align:start position:0%
would need to obtain another health
certificate

01:57:31.910 --> 01:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be great to have
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
veterinarians be able to indicate that
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
this was in fact a duplicate
 
01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
and that would help reduce some of that
 
01:57:43.510 --> 01:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
research that's necessary
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture when
 
01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.790 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture when
reviewing

01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing
 
01:57:49.189 --> 01:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
the number of transfers anyone in
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
particular has had
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
so that's something that i would like to
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
have taken into consideration
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
as nancy holmes mentioned the bill does
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
outline rescue shelters and pet vendors
 
01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
as accessing the database to submit data
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's necessary or
 
01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.470 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's necessary or
appropriate

01:58:08.470 --> 01:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
mr crawford had mentioned that licensed
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
veterinarians in new hampshire were the
 
01:58:14.470 --> 01:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
only ones who
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
should be issuing health certificates
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
therefore i think they would be the only
 
01:58:22.229 --> 01:58:22.239 align:start position:0%
ones that would have a need to
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
get health certificate data into the
 
01:58:24.239 --> 01:58:25.669 align:start position:0%
get health certificate data into the
database

01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
shelters or pet vendors for example
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
would not have the authority to
 
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
create or issue a health certificate
 
01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.149 align:start position:0%
create or issue a health certificate
therefore

01:58:34.149 --> 01:58:34.159 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:58:37.669 --> 01:58:37.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't need to get one into the system
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is also true for the waiver that
 
01:58:41.830 --> 01:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
was mentioned in 437
 
01:58:46.070 --> 01:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
colon 8 roman numeral 2-a
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
i think we need to remove the line that
 
01:58:49.119 --> 01:58:49.910 align:start position:0%
i think we need to remove the line that
mentions

01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
mentions
 
01:58:51.990 --> 01:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
licensed pet vendor or other person
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
authorized to submit the animal records
 
01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:55.109 align:start position:0%
authorized to submit the animal records
database

01:58:55.109 --> 01:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
database
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
from being able to submit the waiver
 
01:59:00.070 --> 01:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we need to take
 
01:59:02.950 --> 01:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
a look at moving on in that same
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
section roman numeral five this is where
 
01:59:08.790 --> 01:59:08.800 align:start position:0%
the animal shelter facility exemptions
 
01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:10.159 align:start position:0%
come into play
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
we talked a little bit earlier about how
 
01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
shelters are exempt
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
from submitting health certificates for
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
dogs or cats or ferrets who have been
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
obtained in new hampshire
 
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
i do think that we do need to add
 
01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.149 align:start position:0%
i do think that we do need to add
information

01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
that has that data tracked in the system
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
still because
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
those are still transfers and if we want
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
to ensure that those animals have been
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
transferred healthy
 
01:59:38.870 --> 01:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether they have a official health
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
certificate or not
 
01:59:42.629 --> 01:59:42.639 align:start position:0%
we should be considering how those are
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
being tracked
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
so that they are getting that level of
 
01:59:48.330 --> 01:59:48.340 align:start position:0%
tracking as well
 
01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.750 align:start position:0%
tracking as well

01:59:49.750 --> 01:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:52.790 --> 01:59:52.800 align:start position:0%
in hb 249 this is another bill on animal
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
shelter facilities
 
01:59:58.149 --> 01:59:58.159 align:start position:0%
a line is being added to
 
02:00:01.510 --> 02:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
actually outline that shelters
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
are required to submit health
 
02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:05.030 align:start position:0%
are required to submit health
certificates

02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
if an animal is obtained from outside of
 
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
and being transferred while they may be
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
doing that currently it is actually not
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
written into law it was dropped out at
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
some point
 
02:00:19.510 --> 02:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to get that piece added
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
back in and i think it would be
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that to
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
be reflected in this bill as well so you
 
02:00:28.390 --> 02:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
can see that on the second page of my
 
02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.750 align:start position:0%
can see that on the second page of my
testimony

02:00:29.750 --> 02:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
i've outlined both of those items to
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're considered
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
secondly in roman numeral six
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
last words in that paragraph
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
control the fact that health
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
certificates only need to be submitted
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
currently upon request and i think if we
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
remove the upon request
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
wording then that's going to make sure
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
that the law stipulates all health
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
certificates need to be submitted moving
 
02:01:02.719 --> 02:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
certificates need to be submitted moving
forward

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:01:06.229 --> 02:01:06.239 align:start position:0%
so we can ensure that the data is
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
accurate in the database
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
and that everyone is submitting those
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
health certificates and by everyone i
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
mean veterinarians
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
the last item that i wanted to bring up
 
02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
today was
 
02:01:20.709 --> 02:01:20.719 align:start position:0%
the fees we talked about how the
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
database was going to be
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
funded and how this database is
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
necessary due to the legislation that
 
02:01:29.189 --> 02:01:29.199 align:start position:0%
was put in place
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
and putting
 
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
hard to enforce laws on the department
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:41.109 --> 02:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
due to that i don't think that it is
 
02:01:42.950 --> 02:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have the fees
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
put on the dog and cap readers of new
 
02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:46.950 align:start position:0%
put on the dog and cap readers of new
hampshire

02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:01:49.270 --> 02:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask for those numbers to be
 
02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask for those numbers to be
reduced

02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
we actually fought very hard against
 
02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:53.910 align:start position:0%
we actually fought very hard against
that

02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
and so to have any fees to help fund
 
02:01:58.149 --> 02:01:58.159 align:start position:0%
this database
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
to help enforce the decreased threshold
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
and categorizing as a pet vendor and
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
requirement of being licensed and
 
02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
already paying a 200
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
license fee to become a pet vendor
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
or for everybody else who doesn't get to
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
that threshold
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
i just think that it further burdens
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
that community and so we do need to look
 
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
to other ways to fund this database
 
02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.709 align:start position:0%
to other ways to fund this database
[Applause]

02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
and lastly i just want to support
 
02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:30.629 align:start position:0%
and lastly i just want to support

discussion regarding edi for the data
 
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:34.790 align:start position:0%
discussion regarding edi for the data
transmission

02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
02:02:37.270 --> 02:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think that is a great way to help
 
02:02:39.350 --> 02:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
avoid some of the security concerns that
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
we have here
 
02:02:42.709 --> 02:02:42.719 align:start position:0%
and getting the data needed where it
 
02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
needs to go
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to answer any
 
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.790 align:start position:0%
and i would be happy to answer any
questions

02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
duties of veterinarians and then as part
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
of that section it goes on to
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
to to discuss you know tagging of the
 
02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.270 align:start position:0%
to to discuss you know tagging of the
animal

02:03:59.270 --> 02:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
animal
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
right like so it's clear that it really
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't really well thought out before it
 
02:04:07.750 --> 02:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
was passed
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to take a poorly
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
written statute and we're going to
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
expand upon it and then we're going to
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
take a cr we're going to create a
 
02:04:18.790 --> 02:04:18.800 align:start position:0%
database and put it on the internet
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's accessible essentially
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
theoretically by
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
by everyone right because it has an
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
internet presence
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
just it's ripe to be hacked um
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i've i've now signed into a couple
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
of hearings
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
since you guys went to zoom and and this
 
02:04:37.599 --> 02:04:38.069 align:start position:0%
since you guys went to zoom and and this
is

02:04:38.069 --> 02:04:38.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:04:43.669 --> 02:04:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
doing simple things like having zoom
 
02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.270 align:start position:0%
doing simple things like having zoom
meetings

02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
for testimony do you really think we
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
we can handle personal information on a
 
02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:54.069 align:start position:0%
we can handle personal information on a
dat

02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
dat
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
in a database that's accessible over the
 
02:04:56.719 --> 02:04:58.790 align:start position:0%
in a database that's accessible over the
internet

02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
internet
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
i don't i mean there's no discussion on
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
how that database would be secured
 
02:05:08.310 --> 02:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
i would urge the state to come up with a
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
set of standards
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
and processes and procedures for
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
how the state would secure a database
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
not just for this
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
use but broadly in general there really
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
should be a standard for says
 
02:05:24.790 --> 02:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know the box gets put on a
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
particular vlan that these are the
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
there there are firewall rules to
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
protect it there are acls to protect it
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
you know et cetera et cetera et cetera
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
there are no standards
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore this can't be secured
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
um there there's no
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
there's no expiration on the record so
 
02:05:45.430 --> 02:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
the state is
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
apparently obligated to keep and
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
maintain these records
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
forever why would the state want to keep
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
these records
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
why would we want our records kept by
 
02:05:56.709 --> 02:05:56.719 align:start position:0%
the state they should be deleted after a
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
year or two years or five years
 
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
right it's just a hot mess i mean as i
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
understand that the whole motivation
 
02:06:03.679 --> 02:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
understand that the whole motivation
behind

02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
behind
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
this statue revolved or revolved around
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
thresholds for licensing is that a true
 
02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:15.750 align:start position:0%
thresholds for licensing is that a true
statement

02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
are you asking the chair a question i'm
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
asking anyone i mean
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding right or wrong is that
 
02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
this this
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
the rsa was passed into law
 
02:06:30.790 --> 02:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
in order to to handle the threshold i.e
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
25 dogs or 50 dogs or whatever it may be
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
so that the state um can handle the
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
whole licensing aspect of this
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
well it seems like we're chasing our
 
02:06:45.910 --> 02:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
tail over this right
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
instead of of creating this database and
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
this requirement
 
02:06:52.790 --> 02:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
for vets to to submit all this
 
02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:54.229 align:start position:0%
for vets to to submit all this
information

02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
so that in theory the state could
 
02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:57.669 align:start position:0%
so that in theory the state could
tabulate

02:06:57.669 --> 02:06:57.679 align:start position:0%
tabulate
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
oh now we have a person that's this you
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
know cross a threshold
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
and we need to force their licensure
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
right instead of doing that
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
this information is already submitted to
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
the town clerk
 
02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
and it's associated with a person and an
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
address right
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
we're required to for our dogs
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
and our cats to get to get rabies
 
02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
vaccines every year
 
02:07:23.229 --> 02:07:23.239 align:start position:0%
so why are we putting a burden on
 
02:07:23.239 --> 02:07:25.030 align:start position:0%
so why are we putting a burden on
veterinarians

02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarians
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
and individuals to transmit this data
 
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
to the state so it can be collated or
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
correlated to
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
in order to theoretically come up with
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
who needs to be licensed
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
right and then the enforcement piece of
 
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
this instead
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
why aren't we asking the our town clerks
 
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
to transmit all of this information up
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
02:07:49.510 --> 02:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
and then boom the state has the
 
02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:50.950 align:start position:0%
and then boom the state has the
information

02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's simple it's elegant instead we're
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
creating this whole infrastructure
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
i i really would urge the the
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
the committee to to itl this bill or
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
amend it so that it starts to fix some
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the issues with the statute
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
i mean you read through it as a normal
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr gaffney is there
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
any questions are you willing to take
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
any questions from the
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
sure are there any questions for mr
 
02:08:27.119 --> 02:08:29.669 align:start position:0%
sure are there any questions for mr
gaffney

02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
gaffney
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr gaffney we appreciate your
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
02:08:46.229 --> 02:08:46.239 align:start position:0%
all right so we have another hand raised
 
02:08:46.239 --> 02:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
all right so we have another hand raised
oh

02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
representative bolton did you have a
 
02:08:48.159 --> 02:08:57.270 align:start position:0%
representative bolton did you have a
question

02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i can't hear
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
his question was is this bill flag to go
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
to a second committee
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
in and the answer is yes it is i'm not
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
clear yet i believe it's going to
 
02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
clear yet i believe it's going to
finance

02:09:08.550 --> 02:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
finance
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it's going anywhere
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
else than that but i would have to check
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
with the speaker's office
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's going to
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:09:26.870 --> 02:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
we certainly i i would agree that we
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
certainly should make sure we're putting
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
forth good legislation
 
02:09:32.550 --> 02:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
it now it certainly will go through the
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
senate as well and where they'll assign
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
it i'm
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
obviously unaware of it but thank you
 
02:09:38.390 --> 02:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
all right so we have um dennis goulet
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
with his hand up uh dennis did you want
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
to address the committee
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.950 --> 02:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
um mr chair members of the committee
 
02:09:57.189 --> 02:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you for giving me the
 
02:09:59.030 --> 02:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is dennis
 
02:09:59.040 --> 02:09:59.589 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak my name is dennis
goulet

02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
goulet
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
i'm the commissioner for the department
 
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
of information technology for the
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire um i'm going to speak
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
on to both of the bills i will start out
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
with the um
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
i'll start out with the security and
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
privacy topic which really i
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
think covers both and then i'll jump
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
into um
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
another set of comments um first and
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
foremost i want to address the assertion
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
in testimony that the state does not
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
have standards for security and privacy
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
of data
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that is just simply incorrect and we and
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
our we have processes
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
that involve that are heavily involved
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the acquisition of
 
02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:46.550 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the acquisition of
technology

02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:10:48.870 --> 02:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the standards for security and
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
privacy are directly related to the type
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
of information that we store so uh
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
so it's a personal information pii as
 
02:10:59.589 --> 02:10:59.599 align:start position:0%
you would be storing
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
here under this circumstance and
 
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
personal health
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
information those are among the highest
 
02:11:08.629 --> 02:11:08.639 align:start position:0%
category of information therefore
 
02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
we have the highest requirements for our
 
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
vendor partners
 
02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
or for ourselves if we're writing
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
software ourselves
 
02:11:17.350 --> 02:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
that goes through the contracting
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
process which is reviewed both by the
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
department of information technology
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
in rfps requests for proposals and final
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
contracts when awarded ag's office is
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
involved in that as well and when we
 
02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.069 align:start position:0%
involved in that as well and when we
have

02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
legal questions which sometimes come up
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
with respect to how we would manage
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
a certain type of data they are always
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
involved in that process
 
02:11:44.069 --> 02:11:44.079 align:start position:0%
in terms of approving the contract so
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
we do have a robust and mature process
 
02:11:50.109 --> 02:11:50.119 align:start position:0%
for requiring technology that will in
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
fact um
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
assure the security and privacy of data
 
02:11:57.750 --> 02:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
any system can be hacked though of
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
course so in any process can be hacked
 
02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen that over and over
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
again in the united states
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
in the case of the question of edi
 
02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
versus online access to
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
data you know one of the things about
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
edi that wasn't mentioned
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
is that it does put a technology burden
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
on the other end of the other
 
02:12:25.669 --> 02:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
end of the transaction so for example
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
we do edi with lots of healthcare
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
entities in the state of new hampshire
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty easy for them to do like
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
it's a hospital or something that's the
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
kind of thing they do all the time
 
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
if it's a you know if it's a smaller
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
entity it's much more problematic
 
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
and definitely having online resources
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
that are appropriately
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
managed and secured is
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
is important finally on in terms of the
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
security and privacy of data
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
one of the things we just were working
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
on and are
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
implementing is that new sets of
 
02:13:02.079 --> 02:13:03.109 align:start position:0%
implementing is that new sets of
policies

02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
as it relates to monitoring of systems
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
and particularly systems that are online
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
um so that so that we our security
 
02:13:15.430 --> 02:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
our sock or our security operations
 
02:13:16.629 --> 02:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
center can
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
watch and see what's going on in an
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
application for example
 
02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
one of things we look at on some of our
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
health and human services systems um
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
and that's this is really enforced by
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
the center for medicaid medicare
 
02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
the center for medicaid medicare
medicaid

02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
services cms is that we watch for
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
unauthorized access in real time so
 
02:13:41.189 --> 02:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
02:13:44.069 --> 02:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
so there there really is a lot of there
 
02:13:44.079 --> 02:13:44.470 align:start position:0%
so there there really is a lot of there
is

02:13:44.470 --> 02:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
really is a lot of robust technology
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
being applied to these systems
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
we also have um we have
 
02:13:56.709 --> 02:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
very sophisticated defense in depth
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
technologies to protect the systems we
 
02:13:59.830 --> 02:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
have in our
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
in our data center and we also
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
work to secure and make sure that if the
 
02:14:08.870 --> 02:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
systems are in the cloud
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
we are able to monitor them as well so
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
so i think that's that concludes my um
 
02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
um security and privacy i will now move
 
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:20.629 align:start position:0%
um security and privacy i will now move
to

02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
resourcing um and this really is
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
i think more specific to 532
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
um you know i was disappointed to see
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
that there's no
 
02:14:35.750 --> 02:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
expense side of the fiscal note there
 
02:14:38.310 --> 02:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
while fiscal notes are generally for us
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
no fun to complete
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
we do we do like to complete them for
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
bills like this because
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
it helps us assure the success of the
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
program if it is
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
if it is enacted into law
 
02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
and you heard uh commissioner jasper
 
02:14:56.629 --> 02:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
speaking earlier about resourcing and
 
02:14:59.270 --> 02:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
how long it takes to get anything done
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
in the department of agriculture from an
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
iet perspective i would
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely echo his comments
 
02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
i would absolutely echo his comments
there

02:15:06.310 --> 02:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
and um you know the department of
 
02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.990 align:start position:0%
and um you know the department of
agriculture

02:15:09.990 --> 02:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
has no full-time i.t staff to address
 
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
application things they have uh one
 
02:15:20.950 --> 02:15:20.960 align:start position:0%
shared resource who supports 20
 
02:15:24.229 --> 02:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
entities that's 20 2-0 so he you know he
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
figured he's getting about 1
 
02:15:27.430 --> 02:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
20th of a person and that's what
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
agriculture is paying for
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
we had a similar situation until
 
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
recently with the office of professional
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
licensure and certification
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
and um so i've been here i may all be uh
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
six years as commissioner
 
02:15:43.830 --> 02:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i in the first you know five years
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
we got very little done
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
there i mean we got some things done
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
here and there chipping away at it
 
02:15:51.030 --> 02:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
but really we didn't get much done uh
 
02:15:53.589 --> 02:15:53.599 align:start position:0%
oplc recently funded
 
02:15:56.310 --> 02:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
um a couple of positions i t positions
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
in their organs in my organization but
 
02:16:00.069 --> 02:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
dedicated to them
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
and in the past few months we've gotten
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
more done
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
in that organization from a
 
02:16:06.079 --> 02:16:07.350 align:start position:0%
in that organization from a
modernization

02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
and an improving citizen service
 
02:16:09.119 --> 02:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
and an improving citizen service
perspective

02:16:10.550 --> 02:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
02:16:13.109 --> 02:16:13.119 align:start position:0%
um than we had the entire five years
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
before that
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
so um i will i will echo commissioner
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:19.030 align:start position:0%
so um i will i will echo commissioner
jasper's

02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
jasper's
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
and in fact i'm concerned that the group
 
02:16:24.550 --> 02:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
related to the success of this program
 
02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
without dedicated i.t staffing both for
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
this program
 
02:16:30.550 --> 02:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the other programs inside of
 
02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture i don't
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
see us modernizing at any reasonable
 
02:16:34.639 --> 02:16:35.830 align:start position:0%
see us modernizing at any reasonable
pace

02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
pace
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
without that we have a staffing model
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
that fits well
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
into the size of the of the department
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
of agriculture that we've
 
02:16:46.309 --> 02:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
successfully used at the office of
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think that staffing model which is two
 
02:16:52.469 --> 02:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
people would be perfect
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
for ag and i would encourage um
 
02:16:57.589 --> 02:16:57.599 align:start position:0%
i would encourage us to think about that
 
02:16:59.190 --> 02:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to this
 
02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:00.629 align:start position:0%
particularly as it relates to this
program

02:17:00.629 --> 02:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
and i would also encourage us to do a
 
02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
detailed um
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the expense side if
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
possible in the process
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
now that concludes my testimony and i'm
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
us in the committee room we're having a
 
02:17:20.070 --> 02:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of a hard time to understand
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
you it's kind of muffled
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
would it be possible for you to perhaps
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
put these highlights in an email and
 
02:17:27.190 --> 02:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
send it to the committee
 
02:17:29.589 --> 02:17:29.599 align:start position:0%
yes i absolutely can that would be much
 
02:17:29.599 --> 02:17:30.230 align:start position:0%
yes i absolutely can that would be much
appreciated

02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
02:17:31.990 --> 02:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple of hands up here for
 
02:17:33.349 --> 02:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions uh
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
rep kaplan you have a question yes thank
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
you mr chair for taking my question
 
02:17:40.950 --> 02:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
um commissioner goulet uh this is more
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
of a general question but
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh could you address the statement by
 
02:17:46.150 --> 02:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner jasper that the
 
02:17:48.389 --> 02:17:48.399 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture is having uh
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
databases designed by prisoners in the
 
02:17:50.399 --> 02:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
databases designed by prisoners in the
state

02:17:51.110 --> 02:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
and is this particular database also
 
02:17:54.629 --> 02:17:54.639 align:start position:0%
being designed by prisoners in the
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
state's corrections system
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question sir um
 
02:18:02.950 --> 02:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
that that system that commissioner
 
02:18:04.870 --> 02:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
jasper is describing
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
is i think it's uh it's so very old
 
02:18:08.479 --> 02:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
is i think it's uh it's so very old
system

02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:18:12.230 --> 02:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
predates my uh my tenure but
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh no we don't we don't actually have
 
02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh use the department of corrections to
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
do any of our i.t
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
work but i think that it had been done
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next we have representative
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
murray has her hand up
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair for taking my
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
question and thank you commissioner
 
02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:37.990 align:start position:0%
question and thank you commissioner
goulet

02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:38.000 align:start position:0%
goulet
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
can you speak to some of the concerns
 
02:18:40.399 --> 02:18:41.830 align:start position:0%
can you speak to some of the concerns
around

02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:18:47.830 --> 02:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
concerns with regard to perhaps even
 
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
when a veterinarian would submit a
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
record electronically
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there be some sort of
 
02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:57.349 align:start position:0%
wouldn't there be some sort of
verification

02:18:57.349 --> 02:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
verification
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
um or a receipt of submission that would
 
02:19:01.190 --> 02:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
give them
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
a confirmation that their data has been
 
02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.389 align:start position:0%
a confirmation that their data has been
transferred

02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
02:19:12.709 --> 02:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
if they were accessing the system as is
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
proposed then they would
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know again they get once a form was
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
entered or data was completed they get
 
02:19:19.990 --> 02:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
that data was um was successfully saved
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
02:19:25.830 --> 02:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
typically what we would do in an
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
electronic data interchange scenario
 
02:19:28.709 --> 02:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
um you know there would be also be an
 
02:19:31.439 --> 02:19:32.389 align:start position:0%
um you know there would be also be an
acknowledgement

02:19:32.389 --> 02:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
of receipt but it would be an offline
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement it would go back to them
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
so when we
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
when we have for example if a hospital
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
transfers information over to the health
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
and human services then
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
there needs to be an acknowledgment back
 
02:19:49.830 --> 02:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
that that data was received
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:55.030 --> 02:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
all right i um i don't any other
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
questions for uh mr goulet
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
are you seeing none thank you for your
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we appreciate you coming in
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
addressing the committee
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for the time all right i only
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
see one more hand up which is uh
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
nancy holmes wants a second bite at the
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
apple i guess go ahead nancy what
 
02:20:14.630 --> 02:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
what have you got yes thank you mr
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um
 
02:20:18.070 --> 02:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
i had um two things i think i whipped
 
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
through the edi stuff a little too
 
02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:20.469 align:start position:0%
through the edi stuff a little too
quickly

02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
02:20:22.389 --> 02:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
so that not everybody heard what i was
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
saying which was that
 
02:20:26.070 --> 02:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
not that we would use the exact edi
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
protocol because i know exactly how much
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
work that takes on either end but that
 
02:20:32.389 --> 02:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
we use the concept
 
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
of having the sender
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
drop the data off and the updating be
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
done on the side
 
02:20:42.469 --> 02:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
of the person with the database without
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
the sender having to have
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
their hands in the database to the
 
02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:47.590 align:start position:0%
their hands in the database to the
directly

02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
directly
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
um it was just to increase security for
 
02:20:52.550 --> 02:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
the transmission of the information
 
02:20:54.710 --> 02:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
um the other thing was i totally forgot
 
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
was who's going to enforce that health
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
certificates are obtained
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
for transfer this bill allows not just
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
for puppies by vendors
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
this bill says anybody who is
 
02:21:08.389 --> 02:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
transferring any dog
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
cat or ferret kitten or puppy or
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
whatever you call a ferret
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
kit all of those people will have to
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
obtain a health certificate
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
in order to transfer an animal that
 
02:21:22.309 --> 02:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
means the general public
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
so far right now nobody does this
 
02:21:27.429 --> 02:21:27.439 align:start position:0%
nobody i don't think i've ever seen an
 
02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
adult animal offered
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
for transfer with a health certificate
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
other than by a responsible breeder
 
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
and so i mean who's going to enforce
 
02:21:40.790 --> 02:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
that there are even going to be
 
02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
any health certificates to be put into
 
02:21:43.990 --> 02:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
the database
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
um as far as i know nobody does this
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
nancy i'm going to have to
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
wrap up you've had a shot here and i've
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
got people that want to speak so thank

i am calling today to speak in
 
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
opposition of hp
 
02:22:19.110 --> 02:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
438 i do believe that the creation of
 
02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
the animal records database is crucial
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire
 
02:22:26.309 --> 02:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
as representative from stratford shared
 
02:22:27.590 --> 02:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
when introducing hb
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
532 health certificates do not only
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
indicate the current health and medical
 
02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
indicate the current health and medical
history

02:22:33.510 --> 02:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
history
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
of animals that are transferred in new
 
02:22:35.359 --> 02:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
of animals that are transferred in new
hampshire

02:22:36.630 --> 02:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:22:38.630 --> 02:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
which prevents animal suffering and the
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
spread of disease
 
02:22:42.230 --> 02:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
including those that are zoonotic and
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
can be transferred from animals to
 
02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:44.950 align:start position:0%
can be transferred from animals to
humans

02:22:44.950 --> 02:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
humans
 
02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
but also to monitor the number of
 
02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
animals transferred in new hampshire
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
which directly links to the licensing
 
02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and regulation
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
of pet vendors and the enforcement of
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
those laws and regulations
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
i would like to speak to one of the
 
02:22:58.230 --> 02:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
major reasons
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
why the inefficient method of which
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
health certificates are currently stored
 
02:23:04.389 --> 02:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture came to
 
02:23:04.399 --> 02:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
at the department of agriculture came to
light

02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
light
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
which was due to the occurrence of a
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
slew of animal cruelty cases in new
 
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire over recent years
 
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
involving breeders and the cruelty of
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of animals including
 
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:17.680 align:start position:0%
zoonotic diseases in order for law
 
02:23:19.590 --> 02:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement and the state
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
to determine how many transfers of
 
02:23:24.389 --> 02:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
animals took place in those cases
 
02:23:25.990 --> 02:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and to help determine whether or not
 
02:23:27.590 --> 02:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
those breeders should also have been
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
licensed and regulated
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
it was nearly impossible to sort through
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
the tens of thousands of certificates
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
the department received per year
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
and track down the relevant certificates
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
to review them
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
so that briefly speaks to the gravity of
 
02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to implement hb and
 
02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
hb438 as written which prevents
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
accessibility of law enforcement
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
even by a subpoena it in major part
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
defeats the purpose of creating the
 
02:23:58.830 --> 02:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
database in the first place
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
additionally pet vendors whether pet
 
02:24:03.349 --> 02:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
stores breeders or rescues
 
02:24:05.429 --> 02:24:05.439 align:start position:0%
they are making the decision to breed
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
and or sell or adopt
 
02:24:09.030 --> 02:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
out these sentient beings that are
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
welcomed into the homes of residents and
 
02:24:13.110 --> 02:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
become companion animals
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
any illnesses or ailments an animal may
 
02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:16.630 align:start position:0%
any illnesses or ailments an animal may
have

02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:24:18.469 --> 02:24:18.479 align:start position:0%
not only could pose emotional and
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
financial hardship but also risk the
 
02:24:22.630 --> 02:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
health and safety of family members
 
02:24:25.750 --> 02:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors and communities residents
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
have the right to access information on
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not the pet vendor they are
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
considering purchasing
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
a valued companion from additionally
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes for thousands of dollars
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
are licensed and whether or not those
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
pet vendors have had
 
02:24:43.510 --> 02:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
any violations to state law or have been
 
02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:44.469 align:start position:0%
any violations to state law or have been
suspended

02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
suspended
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the public also has the right to know
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
where the animals were initially
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
transferred from
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
because when pet stores purchase animals
 
02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:54.319 align:start position:0%
from breeders to sell to the public
 
02:24:56.150 --> 02:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
that information on where those animals
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
were purchased from is included in the
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
health certificate
 
02:25:01.510 --> 02:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
and the transfer records having access
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
to that information before a purchase
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
helps to prevent cruelty and the spread
 
02:25:08.550 --> 02:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
of disease because it speaks to the
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
living conditions and the treatment of
 
02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:10.630 align:start position:0%
living conditions and the treatment of
those

02:25:10.630 --> 02:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:25:13.270 --> 02:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
animals the reason why the need to know
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
law which is cited in this bill
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
rsa 91-a was established
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
was for the transparency of government
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
actions for the public certainly that
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
includes which pet vendors the state
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
grants a license to
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
and whether or not they have any
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
violations of laws and regulations
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
similar to the u.s freedom of
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
information act which is used
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis just for these very
 
02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:38.870 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis just for these very
purposes

02:25:38.870 --> 02:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
although i support the creation of the
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
animal database
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
we must ensure that the data is
 
02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:45.910 align:start position:0%
we must ensure that the data is
accessible

02:25:45.910 --> 02:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
in order for it to be an efficient tool
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
and for it to be meaningful
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
that's all that i'd like to share with
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
you today thank you very much
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we do have one hand raised

representative murray did you have a
 
02:25:59.359 --> 02:26:00.550 align:start position:0%
representative murray did you have a
question

is this um certificate like large
animals

02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
animals
 
02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
for example have coggins in the event
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes we currently have uh mrs grafano

02:26:40.710 --> 02:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
about one minute so representative
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
murray if you want to
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%

representative crawford i'll allow that
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative i'm elevating from state
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
veterinarian to now an elected official
 
02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
or maybe that's not an elevation i don't
 
02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
or maybe that's not an elevation i don't
know

02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:55.349 align:start position:0%
know
[Laughter]

02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right we had representative murray
 
02:26:59.990 --> 02:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and i apologize to
 
02:27:02.550 --> 02:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
the previous um
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
for the error um mr crawford so my
 
02:27:07.670 --> 02:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
question was with regard to large
 
02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:08.309 align:start position:0%
question was with regard to large
animals

02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
animals
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
um like like a coggins would be issued
 
02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
to an equine animal
 
02:27:17.110 --> 02:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
um similarly with small animal transfer
 
02:27:18.630 --> 02:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
isn't that some of the intent for the
 
02:27:21.270 --> 02:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
health certificate within 14 days
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
to let folks know that those animals are
 
02:27:24.950 --> 02:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
healthy for
 
02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:28.389 align:start position:0%
healthy for
transfer

02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah the entire purpose of the
 
02:27:32.550 --> 02:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
official health stuff kit
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
originally was to assure the health of
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
that animal before it's transferred
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
it is i think commissioner jasper
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
touched on this at the very beginning
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
that official health certificate is the
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
only way that we have to know how many
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
individual animals a particular entity
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
is transferred so that's why it's
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
being used in that fashion too but yes
 
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose is assuring animal health
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
thank you dr crawford you're welcome
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
do you see any further hands raised all
 
02:28:00.790 --> 02:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
right i'd like to thank everybody for
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
testifying um
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna read off the blue sheet so for
 
02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:05.190 align:start position:0%

and to present this bill is the sponsor
 
02:29:15.670 --> 02:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i come today
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
before the e a committee and i thank you
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
all for receiving my testimony to uh
 
02:29:27.510 --> 02:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 226.
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
so the department of agriculture came to
 
02:29:31.349 --> 02:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
me and asked me to introduce this bill
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
originally because the
 
02:29:35.990 --> 02:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
repeal date is coming up on the produce
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
safety laws and now every five years we
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
have them sunset so that we have to
 
02:29:41.990 --> 02:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
review them and
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
basically make them effective again by
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
repealing the
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
the uh date so we i'm the original
 
02:29:49.990 --> 02:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill was to
 
02:29:55.270 --> 02:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
extend that date from 2021 to 2026.
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
another situation that was brought to
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
light as we were approaching
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
and about a stop sale order provision
 
02:30:06.550 --> 02:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:30:11.110 --> 02:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh in rsa 426 which is a separate
 
02:30:13.309 --> 02:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
chapter of this law which is
 
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
rsa426a and that stop sale provision
 
02:30:20.070 --> 02:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
it was a a stretch whether the the
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner and
 
02:30:23.830 --> 02:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
his agents could apply that stop sale
 
02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
language to
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
chapter 426 a if they found that someone
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
was in violation of the inspection
 
02:30:30.160 --> 02:30:31.110 align:start position:0%
was in violation of the inspection
requirements

02:30:31.110 --> 02:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:30:35.270 --> 02:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
in 426a so i took in i drafted an
 
02:30:36.389 --> 02:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
amendment which i'll
 
02:30:38.309 --> 02:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
been presenting to the committee today
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
to add that stop sale language that we
 
02:30:42.230 --> 02:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
modified slightly
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
from chapter 426 to make it appropriate
 
02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:45.550 align:start position:0%
from chapter 426 to make it appropriate
to

02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:48.389 --> 02:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
426a and give the commissioner that
 
02:30:48.399 --> 02:30:49.990 align:start position:0%
426a and give the commissioner that
authority

02:30:49.990 --> 02:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
authority
 
02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
with that i'm actually going to wrap up
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
and let the commissioner speak a little
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
further if he would like to
 
02:30:58.710 --> 02:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
to the to the provisions of this bill
 
02:31:00.389 --> 02:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions i
 
02:31:01.510 --> 02:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly be willing to take some
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:10.870 --> 02:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for
 
02:31:15.030 --> 02:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative pearl seeing none
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh i would invite uh commissioner jasper
 
02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
please speak madam chairman
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and thank you
 
02:31:25.190 --> 02:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearl for
 
02:31:29.429 --> 02:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
putting the village amendment forward
 
02:31:32.630 --> 02:31:32.640 align:start position:0%
to clarify the
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
fisma food safety modernization act
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
originally was with the department of
 
02:31:39.910 --> 02:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
health and human
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
services that program was moved over to
 
02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
the department of agriculture
 
02:31:48.790 --> 02:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago before it was
 
02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
really implemented on the ground
 
02:31:55.590 --> 02:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
it is a five-year funded program and
 
02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:56.070 align:start position:0%
it is a five-year funded program and
that

02:31:56.070 --> 02:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:59.510 --> 02:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
federal funding is up
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
this year and the intent was never to
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
put any responsibility
 
02:32:06.389 --> 02:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
financially on the state to run the
 
02:32:06.399 --> 02:32:07.670 align:start position:0%
financially on the state to run the
program

02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
so thus the hard stop date
 
02:32:14.230 --> 02:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
and we are assuming that the program
 
02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
will be funded however if it is not
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
i would hope the legislature would pass
 
02:32:22.630 --> 02:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
this but that the bill
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
would stay on the governor's desk until
 
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
such time
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
that we were assured that the feds were
 
02:32:29.429 --> 02:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
going to fund it
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i i would ask the governor if it's
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
not funded by june 30 that he vetoed the
 
02:32:33.920 --> 02:32:36.389 align:start position:0%
not funded by june 30 that he vetoed the
bill

02:32:36.389 --> 02:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.110 --> 02:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amendment there is some
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
some question
 
02:32:42.150 --> 02:32:42.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's worth arguing about
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
in a quarter law whether the
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner has the
 
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:47.680 align:start position:0%
um the ability to stop sale of product
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
that has not
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
met the health safety standards within
 
02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:52.309 align:start position:0%
met the health safety standards within
fisma

02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
fisma
 
02:32:54.389 --> 02:32:54.399 align:start position:0%
and i think we all want to be sure that
 
02:32:56.070 --> 02:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
only food that
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
meets those standards is offered for
 
02:33:01.670 --> 02:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
sale to our citizens and
 
02:33:04.469 --> 02:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
so to clarify that i would certainly
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
make every
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
effort under the current law to to argue
 
02:33:09.750 --> 02:33:09.760 align:start position:0%
that i had the authorization
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
as i said i just don't think it's it's
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
worth having having a fight
 
02:33:16.550 --> 02:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
there's an easy easy fix here so
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
with that i'll end my testimony and be
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
glad to take any questions
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%

02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:25.270 align:start position:0%

02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation i would close this
 
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.349 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation i would close this
hearing

which will be house bill 272 so
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to uh recess until 1pm

yes i guess yeah i think it's
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%

02:34:34.950 --> 02:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
