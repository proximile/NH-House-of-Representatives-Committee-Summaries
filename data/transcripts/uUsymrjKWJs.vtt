so this is
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
um David Nagel opening the session uh
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
work session on HP 54 allowing
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers to operate
 
00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:33.550 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers to operate
for

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
profit so welcome everybody um I think
 
00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
for the most part the big concerns about
 
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was not content or um what we
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to accomplish with it it was two
 
00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
things that I heard and and
 
00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
representative Woods you're happy to
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
chime in if I'm missing something but
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
one of them was I you know do we agree
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
or disagree on the concept of the bill
 
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
um which I don't think there was that
 
00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
much disagreement on the next concern
 
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
was um um you know this is not the first
 
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
time this bill has come up it's always
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
hit a a wall at the governor's office is
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
there a way that we can look at this
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
bill in a man to get it you know in a
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
man in a form that the governor can
 
00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:23.879 align:start position:0%
support um the third was
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
um the concern that that big cannabis
 
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
would take over
 
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
and I there there was a fourth one that
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
I can't remember what I was thinking
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
about feel free to chime in if you have
 
00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
any thoughts but that's kind of where we
 
00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 align:start position:0%
were and the concept was to look through
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
this bill and make sure that I think all
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
our ducks were in a row before we we
 
00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
our ducks were in a row before we we
went

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.070 align:start position:0%
went
forward

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
um since I representative kofalt brought
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
up some very good issues and it's going
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
to be important that we hear what he has
 
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
to say with that said I I I did have
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
some concerns that I wish the folks in
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
the audience could address and I think I
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
know the answers to these questions but
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
I really want to hear it from you
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
um my big concern is
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
that this is a unique entity um and and
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that the oversight
 
00:08:21.149 --> 00:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
is still the same as it was before is
 
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
that accurate so it's still 126x
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
oversight that doesn't change at
 
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.430 align:start position:0%
oversight that doesn't change at
all

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
problems why I mean this this is a
 
00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:42.039 align:start position:0%
little problematic
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
because we're not the ones that had the
 
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
concerns and we wanted this work session
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
so that all those concerns could be
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
resolved and until that person's here
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
it's kind of hard to know what to
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
say yes why don't you go ahead yeah
 
00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.079 align:start position:0%
maybe I since we're live I guess we do
 
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
need to speak into the microphone
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
phone were you the sponsor I am the
 
00:09:06.509 --> 00:09:06.519 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh thank you I don't I don't
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
have my my tags on I'm sorry uh for the
 
00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
record I am uh representative Wendy
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
Thomas representing the town of marac um
 
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned Governor's objections
 
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
do you know what those
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
are with this governor no yeah but my
 
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the past concerns
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
were you know where this would lead to I
 
00:09:32.069 --> 00:09:32.079 align:start position:0%
mean you know better than me Matt you
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
know what the concerns were Mr chair
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
he's here yeah um my my take he's got
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
icicles from his nose sorry my my take
 
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
is that there's been uh a push from on
 
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
the state side uh to be state run and
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
they're looking that from the economic
 
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
perspective and they would like to run
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
it uh at least that's been the
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
perspective in years past um from what I
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
understand though the state run is for
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
adult use um and that would be up for
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
consideration how it's worked out I see
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
I see what you're saying yeah I think
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
that was a factor that came into play at
 
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
least uh I don't know about last session
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
but when I was in the house before that
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
was one of the concerns no it was last
 
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
was one of the concerns no it was last
session

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:20.519 align:start position:0%
too yeah um I am going to defer to to
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
the people who actually run the
 
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
dispensaries because um they will give
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
you more information I just wanted to
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
see if we we could
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
list the governor's possible objections
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that we can we can speak to those but
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
speakers just to bring you up to speed
 
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
we just started and um what we were
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
looking at number one is are there
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bills conceptually if
 
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
not um structurally and the concerns
 
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
that I've heard number one was um
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
objections potentially from the governor
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that might block this um historically
 
00:11:07.829 --> 00:11:07.839 align:start position:0%
that's been a problem and secondly the
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
other concern that I heard was the fear
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
that this would lead to like big
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis taking over and there was a
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
third concern that I just don't remember
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
what it was and I'd just be really con
 
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:19.720 align:start position:0%
you know uh Curious like what your
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts concerns whatever are and then
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
we want to hear more about the
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
governor and and I'm I'm not aware of
 
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
what the governor's position is on this
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
streaming I understand um um and
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
so um first of all I'd like to apologize
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
to everyone for being late I I ran into
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh more traffic than I expected this
 
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.430 align:start position:0%
uh more traffic than I expected this
morning

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
um so I yeah my concern is primarily the
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
the second one that you mentioned which
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
is um you know I certainly have no issue
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
with companies making a profit my
 
00:11:59.710 --> 00:11:59.720 align:start position:0%
concern is creating an environment m in
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
which you have a combination of profit
 
00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
motive and a high uh degree of
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
Regulation uh which I think is a recipe
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
for uh bad policy anti-competitive
 
00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:15.519 align:start position:0%
practices and something that ultimately
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
harms consumers in this case
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
understanding that consumers are um sort
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
of a very specific um Market if I can
 
00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:27.839 align:start position:0%
use that word um that are that are
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
trying to address uh very specific
 
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
specific health problem so I would like
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
to see uh I would like to see us come up
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
with solutions that um expand access to
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
care expand
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
availability um but that is sort of the
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
root of my concern is you know does this
 
00:12:48.069 --> 00:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
create that kind of environment where um
 
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
people who have very very different
 
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
motives sort of swoop in and turn things
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
in a different direction based on
 
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.790 align:start position:0%
in a different direction based on
different

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
incentives I I I think I I totally
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying because
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
mon monopolization in in healthc care is
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
a huge problem and if I'm understanding
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
you correctly that that's your concern
 
00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
is that you're going to create large
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
entities that will crowd out the small
 
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
correct not only that they will crowd
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
out the smaller entities but that they
 
00:13:25.189 --> 00:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately will function in a way that
 
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:26.839 align:start position:0%
does not serve the people that we're
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
trying to help here boy were on the same
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
page on stuff thanks you've just made my
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
statement the folks in the audience
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
could address the design of the bill um
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
how it would address that um you know um
 
00:13:49.629 --> 00:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
you know there and what your thoughts
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
are about that because I mean it's I to
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
me it's a legitimate concern um Mr chair
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
yes um it was my understanding standing
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
um and disclaimer I was on the board of
 
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
tcal from the before they were actually
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
operational and then when I got in the
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
head of legislature I demur and left the
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
board but it was my understanding uh
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
that uh there no other atcs would be
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
allowed um in the state and as a
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
consequence that was that was part of
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
the current regulation my understanding
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
was that that would not change I didn't
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
see anything here that said this is open
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
in other words the the rule would still
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
stay that if somebody wanted to come to
 
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:39.320 align:start position:0%
the state uh there's all it would have
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
to be by changing legislation it would
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
not be just making it for profit would
 
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
not open it to everybody Tom Dick and
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
Harry that came across the border please
 
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
help me if I misunderstood but that was
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
my uh my understanding of what this
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
would do and not allow it to be opened
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
here I put you on the spot on purpose Mr
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
Simon Mr chairman be be before he begins
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
I may I sort of say in addition to what
 
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
um Dr Nagel uh requested I guess I'm
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
looking for comments on the sort of the
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
root problem because the root problem as
 
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
I heard it is has to do with financing
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
obtaining financing at a reasonable cost
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
and then um I'll just say that I I know
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
considerably less about medical
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
marijuana and atc's than the my
 
00:15:38.749 --> 00:15:38.759 align:start position:0%
colleagues up here and so um I may at
 
00:15:40.269 --> 00:15:40.279 align:start position:0%
times ask you to dumb it down for me a
 
00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:42.519 align:start position:0%
little bit so that I can uh more clearly
 
00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
understand how how things operate in the
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
challenges that you're facing can I just
 
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
say one more thing too because I think
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
we're looking at two separate issues you
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
raised an issue of of access in terms of
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
number of dispensaries but the other big
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
issue is how do you survive how do you
 
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
issue is how do you survive how do you
obtain

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
obtain
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
financing and to me that's what this
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill is about it's not about what you
 
00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:05.959 align:start position:0%
just said and that may be a separate
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
issue and if I'm wrong please let me
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
know thank you Representatives further
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
record Matt Simon Granite Leaf cannabis
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have people behind me who are more
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable on the business aspects so
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
I want to let not talk a whole lot but I
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to address a couple of the high
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
level issues that came up so when this
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
bill first passed the political
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
environment was very difficult difficult
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
uh we had a bill in 2009 that would have
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
created one dispensary like a true
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
Monopoly the governor vetoed that bill
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
and we were two votes short of
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
overriding the veto to pass that so four
 
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
years later uh we got the current the
 
00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:49.319 align:start position:0%
the current law passed allowing four ATC
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
licenses and the thought of having more
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
than four would have been politically
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
Unthinkable in that time because the
 
00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
opposition uh was portraying everything
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
as you know a massive we're opening
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
Pandora's Box we're always opening
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
Pandora's box with with any cannabis
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
bill so there was no appetite for more
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
licenses than at that at the time it
 
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't a crony business lobbying thing
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
because there were no businesses to be
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
lobbying it was setting up a policy from
 
00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
scratch since then uh as the program has
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
developed and as patients have said we
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
don't have enough access at first there
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
were only could only be four
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
dispensaries so a number of years ago
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature added the ability for
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
each ATC to operate a second dispensary
 
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
location so now we have a total of seven
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
dispensaries we can have eight by law
 
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
but there can't be more than eight and
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature has never had a bill
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
that would allow new companies to come
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
into this space so I've been asked that
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
a number of times and I've always said
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you know we wouldn't we wouldn't
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
oppose that that you know patients in
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
other states have lots of options if
 
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:01.720 align:start position:0%
you're in Maine or Vermont or
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts there are dozens of
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
companies if not hundreds that are
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
participating in a market and if one
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
company can't produce a product
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
perfectly somebody else can you just buy
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
it from them and everything is much more
 
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
efficient and patients have access to
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
the products they need as part of a
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
market so are we open that I think the
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
answer is absolutely yes but we we
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
haven't seen a bill on that so the
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
question this often gets tied up in the
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
debate of recreational cannabis and and
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
things like that I think that's
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
extremely unfortunate because the people
 
00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
sitting behind us we have a mission it's
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
service to patients we don't know if
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
legalization is going to pass in two
 
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
years or 10 years or ever we have a law
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is set up in such a way that it
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
does not allow us to fulfill our mission
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
the way it should be fulfilled we're
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
we're struggling on those levels so I
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
want to let Keenan and Brandon behind me
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
talk more about how this has negatively
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
impacted the businesses and uh by
 
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
extension the patients by passing all of
 
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
our costs uh onto them so if I could ask
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
a question it seems to me that there's
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
two separate issues number one is we
 
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
have a finance problem that's
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
substantially limiting your ability to
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
function now but we also have a separate
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
access issue that's a separate issue
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
that we probably need to deal with
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
separately yeah I think so when
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas introduced the
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
bill she pointed out that there are five
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
pharmacies in in her town of marac and I
 
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
think all of us know if we get a
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
prescription for something we don't have
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
to drive 45 minutes to the pharmacy to
 
00:19:42.149 --> 00:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
get it so patients will tell you that's
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
an issue as for the political aspects of
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
it I you know the governor has never
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
commented on this so I I have no idea
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
what her position might be but this bill
 
00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:55.720 align:start position:0%
has passed the house with two-thirds it
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
has passed the Senate with two-thirds in
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh if if the legislator's support for
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is overwhelming I would like to
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
think the governor would come to the
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
table actually you raised a question
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
that I had before so I I didn't do my
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
due diligence and look at every bill
 
00:20:15.789 --> 00:20:15.799 align:start position:0%
that's been submitted on this subject in
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
the past but is this bill very similar
 
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the previous bills it is very similar
 
00:20:23.549 --> 00:20:23.559 align:start position:0%
not identical but similar say I'm sorry
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mr it's not identical but it is similar
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay I want to make sure that Brandon
 
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
and Keenan get an opportunity so I'm
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.149 --> 00:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
down thank you okay good
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
morning uh my name is Brandon Pollock I
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
um fairly
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
recently um became uh an volunteer for
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
the chair of the board for tascal
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
wellness which is one of the
 
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
atcs uh one of the three we manufacture
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
products in do and have dispensaries in
 
00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.149 align:start position:0%
products in do and have dispensaries in
Lebanon

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
Lebanon
 
00:21:15.549 --> 00:21:15.559 align:start position:0%
keen and um so Lebanon Keen doers are
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
dispensaries uh manufactur
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester I think essentially from our
 
00:21:22.679 --> 00:21:23.630 align:start position:0%
Manchester I think essentially from our
our

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
perspective as um has been discussed
 
00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
this is a barrier to financing and I
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
think practically pragmatically this
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
issue here is one that has faced a lot
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
of um States over the years most medical
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana programs started with
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
requiring their organizations to be
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofits uh including Massachusetts
 
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
and Maine uh as of today it's just New
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Arizona that are left
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
still requiring these organizations be
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
nonprofits and what we've realized over
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
the years
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%
is we operate as a business we run
 
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
payroll we manufacture Goods we
 
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
transport our products and we dispense
 
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
uh products to our patients in a retail
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
environment so we're not operating as
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
Charity in the conventional sense um
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
we're not eligible for any grant funding
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
we're not eligible for any uh donations
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
no one's supporting this uh from a
 
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:29.190 align:start position:0%
no one's supporting this uh from a
charitable

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
charitable
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
perspective um we're required to take in
 
00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
revenue and pay our team and pay our
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
rent and operate as business however um
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
being structured as a nonprofit reduces
 
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
our ability in a material way to raise
 
00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:48.039 align:start position:0%
funds um tascal situation right now is
 
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
it had taken out a lot of debt to get
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
going at very high interest rates um
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
very high similar to credit card
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
interest rates and continuing to pay
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
that debt is a significant burden for
 
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.070 align:start position:0%
that debt is a significant burden for
the

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
organization if uh this legislation
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
makes it all the way through as it
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's gotten quite close
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
several times that would give the
 
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
organization flexibility to look for
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
more conventional business financing and
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh retire that debt load um we also in
 
00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:25.279 align:start position:0%
our position where you know we've talked
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
with our regulator and we have support
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
to open an another access point as we
 
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
were just talking about we have a
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
dispensary that we still could open but
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
we can't raise the money for it right
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
now so that would I think be an
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
immediate positive benefit to something
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
like this is having some Financial
 
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
flexibility like any other Pharmacy
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
could in New Hampshire to open somewhere
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
else along the perhaps the Sea Coast
 
00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
region where we have patients driving
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
all the way from you know Hampton Beach
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
up to do um but right now there's just
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
no cash flow support it
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
and the market for debt with interest
 
00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
rates going up has actually gotten even
 
00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:08.279 align:start position:0%
worse since we first did fundraising
 
00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:09.870 align:start position:0%
worse since we first did fundraising
so

00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um to address the concern that this
 
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
will I guess change
 
00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
the perception and the visibility of
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
medical marijuana in New Hampshire and
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
create sort of big organizations first
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
as has been noted there's no ability for
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
other companies to enter the market here
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
it's a very small medical marijuana
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
Market with three companies established
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
by Statute at this point so that's not
 
00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:41.559 align:start position:0%
realistic to have new companies come in
 
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
with a profit motive and start uh
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
potentially creating a different
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
environment and then for the existing
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
companies this sort of it's more of a
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
technical corporate change it's not
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
going to dramatically change the way
 
00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
that we operate or our motives our
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
motives today are to operate as a
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
business we're trying to run a lean
 
00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:03.320 align:start position:0%
operation we're trying to serve as many
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
customers as possible uh the fact of the
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
matter is most of our potential
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
customers our patients go to Maine or
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
Vermont right now because our prices are
 
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
so high because we have this debt we're
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to pay off because we can't um
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
operate like a conventional business
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
so I think practically speaking allowing
 
00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
us to operate as a cannabis organization
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
that would not have these restrictions
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
um without any of the benefits of a
 
00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
nonprofit we're not we're not a 501c3
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to be um recognized at
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
the state or the federal level for for
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
any tax advantages of being a nonprofit
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
so um I I'll pause there I feel like
 
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
I've been talking more than normal and
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh yeah happy answer any
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
questions so you mentioned that other
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
states started with the nonprofit model
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
and trans I to a for-profit model um I
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
will ask you and anybody else who wants
 
00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
to comment on it later um what has been
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
the experience in those States following
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
that transition from nonprofit to
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
for-profit sure so um my main company is
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
called Theory Wellness we started in
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now we're in six other
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
markets um we started as a nonprofit
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
under the medical marijuana program in
 
00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:28.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um we converted um when
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state law allowed us and our
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues to convert in 2019 to a uh
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
conventional Corporation and essentially
 
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to um convert our debt
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
that was on the books into equity which
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
is what our initial lenders were were
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
totally fine with they wanted to have an
 
00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um realize success long
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
term and that allowed us to invest in
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
more access points and grow the
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
organization it also allowed a lot less
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
complexity on the accounting side of
 
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
trying to account as a
 
00:27:09.389 --> 00:27:09.399 align:start position:0%
nonprofit when you're not actually a
 
00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um you're have to operate as a
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
business so we have personal experience
 
00:27:13.919 --> 00:27:14.590 align:start position:0%
business so we have personal experience
it

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:17.789 --> 00:27:17.799 align:start position:0%
was it's more of a corporate matter it
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any of the employees or
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
any of our
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
Sops any of our interactions with The
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
Regulators it's really sort of corporate
 
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
restructuring that is um lawyers do okay
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
on and uh we are able to just become a
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
little more normal that's what we've
 
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
been asking
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
industry thank you that's that's that's
 
00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:45.799 align:start position:0%
very helpful so you also mentioned that
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
um there are a lot of patients that go
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
to neighboring states um I imagine that
 
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:52.279 align:start position:0%
there are probably also a lot of
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
patients who simply rely on Street
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
product uh which is not tested or
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
regulated in any way um so do you
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
envision that this would potentially
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
expand access I mean I I imagine that
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
this would expand access to cannabis
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
through the
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
atc's and therefore would um lower the
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
incidence of people sort of resorting to
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
buying cannabis on the street is that
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes is that accurate so I can assure you
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
with lower pricing which would come
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
legislation more patience in the
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
material way would stay within the
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
program as intended uh it's simply
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
economic incentive if prices are higher
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
at dispensaries than they can buy from
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
their friend or from Maine a lot of
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
folks are going to make that decision
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
especially these days to not shop with
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
us but if we can lower pricing which we
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
could if we could reduce this debt load
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
um absolutely more patients will stay
 
00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
within the program as
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
intended I feel like I can comment on
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
that from my past experience but um we
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
do an awful lot of counseling with
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
patients that get on Street product and
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
their answer why they do it is exactly
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
what you said I mean it's we're not
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
competitive with the marketplace and the
 
00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
marketplace does include the street
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
vendors and I you know we constantly in
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
counseling say these are the risks that
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
you're facing they said yeah but this
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
all the money I got and this helps me a
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
lot and this is what I do and now that
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
we're getting you know one of my friends
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
works for um ni and they're looking at
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
um you know fenil and other way cannabis
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
lace with all sorts of other things and
 
00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:30.519 align:start position:0%
he asked me do we have a problem with
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%
that up here and I don't know for sure
 
00:29:36.389 --> 00:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
but if we don't we will and so um you
 
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
know these are really really big Public
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
Safety considerations and and I just you
 
00:29:44.269 --> 00:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
know the price has been a problem from
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
day one um I does anybody else have a
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
question because I have one more
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
but you said um I'm
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
sorry you said you volunteered
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
well the board yeah it's a volunteer
 
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
position on the board of Tasca Wellness
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
one of the state
 
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.830 align:start position:0%
one of the state
atcs

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't get paid it's my I mean we
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
have our other organization um which is
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
supporting tamascal but yeah I'm
 
00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
volunteering on this position y so just
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
following up on the question I asked
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
before about other states experiences
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
have you seen any incidents of
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
um this is a subjective question
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
question but have you seen any incid of
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
of you know companies with individuals
 
00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519 align:start position:0%
or companies with incentives that
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
perhaps don't align with yours
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
or purely profit oriented come in and
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
attempt to take over or or make offers
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
or see you know try to try to seize that
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity in other states yeah I mean
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
I my response to that is that if there's
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
going to be this sort of change
 
00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
is really a corporate change for the
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
three existing organizations that are
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
here um in this in this bill there's no
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
ownership changes um allowed or
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
contemplated for I think at least three
 
00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:12.039 align:start position:0%
years um that being said the real the
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
real way that a organization in a state
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire or any other cannabis
 
00:31:19.269 --> 00:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
Market sort of has to operate and how
 
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
its uh protocols run is a function of
 
00:31:26.549 --> 00:31:26.559 align:start position:0%
the regulations that control um these
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
entities and
 
00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation doesn't change any of
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
the overarching regulations that
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
underpin the medical marijuana program
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so we by switching from
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit to a for-profit on the
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
corporate back end it doesn't mean all
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
of a sudden we can start advertising
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
aggressively because we're not allowed
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
to do that anyway so I would suggest
 
00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:51.029 align:start position:0%
to do that anyway so I would suggest
that

00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:54.039 align:start position:0%
while that's a fair it's a fair point
 
00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
but right now we are operating in a way
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to maximize profit in
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
a techical sense where we're trying to
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
keep this organization afloat and um
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
serve as many patients as we can knowing
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
that most of them are still leaving the
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
state um while also trying to you know
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
reduce our utility cost by upgrading our
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
lighting with with LED lights which we
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
just did in Manchester things like that
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
so we're sort of already operating in in
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
a business sense and I don't expect
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
because the regulations aren't changing
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
I don't expect behaviors from a public
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
facing perspective any organization to
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
change I have a question um I want to
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
understand what this means so um if this
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
bill passes what it would prevent for
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
three years um was the sale of member
 
00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
ship or shares to a foreign corporation
 
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:46.240 align:start position:0%
and I just want to understand what that
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
meant and I will also add in the caveat
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
that I I like is the two-thirds of the
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
members still have to be New Hampshire
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
residents but what exactly is a foreign
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
corporation uh foreign corporation a
 
00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
foreign if you consider New Hampshire
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
domestic foreign would be an out ofate
 
00:33:04.919 --> 00:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
domestic foreign would be an out ofate
entity

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I actually have one other related
 
00:33:24.629 --> 00:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is most of the
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
atc's in this state now and I may be
 
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
atc's in this state now and I may be
wrong

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
but started as an outof State entity
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
that became an instate entity am I wrong
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
about that because like tascal I know
 
00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:38.919 align:start position:0%
you came from another state but you had
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
to create your own inate entity correct
 
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:44.360 align:start position:0%
actually I mean the gentleman behind us
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're 100% independent just
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based um tascal started in
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then one of the
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
founders actually branched out and went
 
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.029 align:start position:0%
founders actually branched out and went
into

00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh Sanctuary same thing
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
they started in New Hampshire um now
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
they have other operations in
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Florida but they uh
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
everything was was actually started here
 
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
which is pretty interesting at one of
 
00:34:10.829 --> 00:34:10.839 align:start position:0%
the first programs on the east coast
 
00:34:10.839 --> 00:34:17.190 align:start position:0%

come before you today um oh yeah thank
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
you very much um my name my name is
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
Keenan Blum uh I come here before you
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
today representing Granite Leaf cannabis
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
formerly known as Prime alternative
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
treatment centers um but I don't come
 
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
before you just as that I also have
 
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
spent nearly the last decade uh working
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
full-time and giving everything I have
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this program is
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
effective and that we serve the patients
 
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
effectively um I started as a technician
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
N9 years ago at the marac dispensary
 
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
um when it first opened or a little bit
 
00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
before that and well I did a variety of
 
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
things there from working the counter um
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
doing inventory handling those things I
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of my time working
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
one-on-one with patients performing uh
 
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
free 1hour consultations and then
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
following up with them over the
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
preceding weeks and months to make sure
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
that they achieved good results with
 
00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and if it was at
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
all all possible that they improved
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
their lives with it um it didn't help
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
everyone but it helped the majority of
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
the people we saw um and for some it was
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
amazing in the results they achieved and
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
it has driven me to continue working on
 
00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
this as hard as I do um we are a company
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
of 45 people all of us live in New
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and we have three
 
00:36:21.069 --> 00:36:21.079 align:start position:0%
facilities a production facility out in
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and dispensaries in marac and
 
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.750 align:start position:0%
Peterboro and dispensaries in marac and
Chai

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:24.760 align:start position:0%
Chai
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
Chester um during that time that I
 
00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
worked with patients uh most of them
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
early on especially most of them had
 
00:36:34.349 --> 00:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
either cancer multiple sclerosis Crohn's
 
00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
disease spinal stenosis or another
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
debilitating condition um after working
 
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
with them many of them told me that they
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
basically got their lives back they were
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
able to spend time with their family
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
again their grandchildren or to
 
00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:49.160 align:start position:0%
participate in their Community again or
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
just to function to be able to get
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
around without as extreme of pain um so
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
this means a lot to me um and it's it's
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
really important that we continue our
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
mission um about four years ago I was
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
elected by our um by our volunteer board
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
as the CEO um so I've taken over that
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
role um and every week we encounter
 
00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
obstacles to function
 
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
obstacles to function
effectively

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
um I am consistently asked as we try to
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
improve our operations improve our
 
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
equipment find economies of scale so
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we're able to um as Brandon talked
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
about compete with out ofate businesses
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
but more so make sure that our patients
 
00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
can access the medicine they need at
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
prices that are affordable to them and
 
00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
they don't turn to other less reputable
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
or less caring sources for that um we we
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
we provide a lot more than just the
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
products themselves however I am
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
consistently asked by whether it be
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
equipment vendors or we we haven't
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
acquired financing in a very long time
 
00:37:55.829 --> 00:37:55.839 align:start position:0%
um because they all ask me for a
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
personal guarantee I am not an owner of
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
this business I have no equity um I have
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
signed those forms because I want us to
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
complete our mission and fulfill what
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to do but I feel it's
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
onerous and it's really a challenge for
 
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
myself when you know especially when you
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
know we look at trying to improve
 
00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
something large like um more efficient
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
lighting that reduces electrical and
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
HVAC costs when I have to sign something
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
saying yes we'll you know we'll owe you
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
these hundreds of thousands of for
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
equipment and I'm putting my own my own
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
house on the line to do so um so in in
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
the last four years we have worked
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
really hard to lower our prices um in
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
this in the time I've been CEO uh our
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
biggest category which is cannabis flow
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
we've reduced by 30 to 40% depending on
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
the skew over the last four years in the
 
00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
cost that we charge patients however um
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
over the border for example in Maine
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
there are little to no regulations or
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
requirements and it is very very hard
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
for us to compete with those prices and
 
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
keep New Hampshire patients shopping in
 
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:06.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire keeping their money in the
 
00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
economy here and allowing us to have the
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
income to function well to handle
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
everything we need to do to pay our
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
staff and provide good jobs so all of
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
that has been a huge challenge um our
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
patients expect better and and we want
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
to do better we're giving this
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
everything we've got but trying to run a
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
business that really matches a
 
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit model um that is a
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and retailer of goods and
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
is already extremely complex due to the
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
requirements of the federal government
 
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:40.520 align:start position:0%
the illegality of it at a federal level
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
is extremely challenging and it is only
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
compounded by this requirement that we
 
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
meet nonprofit requirements in New
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire report to the charitable trust
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
unit um you know and do things in that
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
fashion when none of the paperwork that
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'm expected to fill out matches the I
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
have to explain constantly why we what
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
what we do with donations why do we not
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
have that where's our where's our
 
00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue coming from and when we try to
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
work with vendors if I say we're a
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
nonprofit to try to acquire something
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
they say well where's your
 
00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
501c3 paperwork and I say we don't have
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
that and they say well then who's your
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
owner and I say well we don't we don't
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
have that either so again I end up
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
trying to personally guarantee something
 
00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
with which I have no equity um so each
 
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
one of these steps increases costs you
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
know uh you we with no personal
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
guarantee everyone expects a higher
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
interest rate on anything we do acquire
 
00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
and currently in order to make the
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
improvements we're looking at improve
 
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
our laboratory improve our lighting um
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
renovate our dispensary or improve those
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
things we need a loan um and we cannot
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
acquire one without a personal guarantee
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
I have not found any that'll do it
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
unless you give them management control
 
00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
over the entity to ensure that they get
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
their money back and that then even
 
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
further actually opens things up to
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
for-profit interests rather than a
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
situation where those of us that work
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
really hard for this have some stake and
 
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
a reason to be able to personally
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee items or if really needed to
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
acquire investors so that we can make
 
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:25.720 align:start position:0%
improvements before having to acquire
 
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue from patients to make the
 
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement we can make it first and
 
00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
have patients benefit and enjoy those
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
economies of scale or improve improv
 
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
pieces of equipment so that is our goal
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and I you know I can continue to
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
explain this is the life I I live it
 
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
every day we're trying to accomplish it
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to I don't want to go
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
on with further detail um if you have
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be very happy to
 
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:54.150 align:start position:0%
any questions I'd be very happy to
answer

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
them I was just going to say thank you
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
because I think everything you said has
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
sort of added some depth to what we've
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
heard before so it is very helpful thank
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
you representative um I do you know I I
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
think the experiment in New Hampshire
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
has been very interesting I I do
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate the regulation in the sense
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
that we get a quality product and I
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
think maybe it's a sad statement that
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
other states don't really do that um I
 
00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:18.839 align:start position:0%
do think the baby steps approach to
 
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
doing this probably made sense I think
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
to answer your concerns there's a
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
statutory problem that limits the number
 
00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
of dispensaries that we can have have
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
and that may be a separate issue that we
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
may want to deal with um but this is one
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
of the steps towards making a more
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
efficient model that allows us better
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
access and um be more competitive with
 
00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:41.319 align:start position:0%
the black market as well as our laboring
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
states yeah I I certainly can't disagree
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you and we're we're a very
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
small company just for context we have
 
00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:50.839 align:start position:0%
under 5,000 square feet of canopy where
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
is um a number of companies in
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example have a 100,000
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
square feet of canopy just for that
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
single company alone so as a a group of
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
45 we're really making things at very
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
small scale hand making things but there
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
are times where you know well we're hand
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
counting say um uh fruit shoes into
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
containers uh you know another company
 
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
has a counter that just puts 20 into
 
00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680 align:start position:0%
each bag and so these things are are
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging for us and it's
 
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
hard for us to make these Investments to
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
have the competitive improvements so
 
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:30.480 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has a program that we
 
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
can stand on and be proud of we we want
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
to become a company that New Hampshire
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
patients New Hampshire residents can be
 
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
proud of having in the state that
 
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
represent us well but it is really hard
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
to do it when with our hands somewhat
 
00:43:47.549 --> 00:43:47.559 align:start position:0%
tied in in certain areas and well we
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
want the we love the mission and the
 
00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
idea behind the nonprofit intent the
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
actual practical application of it is
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
extremely challenging
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
so I also wanted to point out one thing
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
that you said very early in your early
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
experience that's very unique to New
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's really important that
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
does have a
 
00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
cost um the medical expertise on
 
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis certification oversight is
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
extremely limited uh I think a lot of
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
the docs that certify not and including
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
me don't have the knowledge base that we
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
really need and we really rely on what
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
you guys do with your patient
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
education um which is really important
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not sure every other state does
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
that not to the level that you guys do
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
it and that's that's got a cost too that
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we really should be proud that we
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
do that um because on some states you
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
just walk and grab some stuff and leave
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
I mean you don't do it that way and
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's really needs to be pointed out it
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
is and that's an extremely frustrating
 
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
thing for us because when the cost is
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
compared the cost is compared by you
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
know a a a a unit of of of in edible or
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
an amount of flour and the reality is is
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
that's not the entirety of the services
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
we provide even today we employ a
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
full-time educator on staff out of our
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
40 time 45 people we have a full-time
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
and a part-time um and we offer still
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
hourlong consultations for free for any
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
patient that wants it whether they shop
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
with us or not and we will continue to
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
do that regardless we've found that I've
 
00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
I've just seen it make improvements to
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
people's lives and the idea of passing
 
00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
that on that opportunity is something I
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
would never want to do um however we
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
want to have patients come through our
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
doors to offer them that service rather
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
than than thinking I'll I'll save some
 
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
money move my move my funds out of state
 
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
but acquire cheaper cannabis and the
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
long-term detriment that they're less
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
likely to find what really helps them
 
00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:50.839 align:start position:0%
with their symptoms and conditions a lot
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
of what we recommend isn't a higher dose
 
00:45:57.109 --> 00:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
or more sales or them consuming more
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
it's very specifically targeting the
 
00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:01.319 align:start position:0%
particular thing they might need which
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
surprisingly often is say non-
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
intoxicating thca is an
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
anti-inflammatory not something that you
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
know reduces their you know immediate
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
mental capacity to function or something
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
else it's something that allows them to
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
effectively goe um just as uh you or
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps anybody else reviews this do you
 
00:46:29.069 --> 00:46:29.079 align:start position:0%
see any sort of you know loopholes um
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
allow some big Corporation to to move in
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh and be um a
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
player or is this protective of the
 
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.589 align:start position:0%
player or is this protective of the
current

00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:46:44.309 --> 00:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
status I I don't necessarily see any
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
loopholes um I think at the moment the
 
00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:49.480 align:start position:0%
the and for the foreseeable future this
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
program in a small state is small enough
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
that there isn't a huge amount of
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
incentive or much incentive for a large
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
Corporation to be involved in that type
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
of situation there certainly is a little
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
bit of Revenue to be had and potentially
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
you know profit so to speak but we're
 
00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
not talking anything hugely substantial
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
we have 15,000 total customers available
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
us to in the to us in the state at this
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
time so when you kind of think about
 
00:47:19.549 --> 00:47:19.559 align:start position:0%
what a individual might spend we're not
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're not talking hundreds of millions
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
of dollars here so you don't in terms of
 
00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
the law itself you don't see any
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
loopholes that uh yeah that's the main
 
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
main concern no but I I I don't think I
 
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
do um but I do appreciate your viewpoint
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
on it and that's certainly a a
 
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
perspective that I I think I appreciate
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
you taking and that we're happy to
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
collaborate on is just making sure that
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
this doesn't have any loopholes or a
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
situation that brings us to a bad place
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to have cannabis in New
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire become a profit making machine
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
that takes it advantage of New Hampshire
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
patients I think that would be the worst
 
00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
result or one of the worst results we
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
could possibly have so I think guard
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
rails that Ure that doesn't happen are
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable um however I I
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
don't think that that the solution there
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
is to require nonprofit status in New
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when it's not available
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
federally those there's no benefit to
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
that that makes it harder but I I do
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
very much respect and and you know
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate the intention that you have
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
of that question and the goal that's
 
00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
there I think that's something that it's
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
extremely important that we maintain and
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I can offer a solution
 
00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
at this moment but you know I think it's
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
something we should work on I mean I
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
think there is an answer to that I mean
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
126 X7 still uh overseas who can buy in
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
this state so there's still a lot of
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
State oversight am I correct I'm looking
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
at you because you know the law you guys
 
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
know the law really he's looking behind
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
you yeah I mean my understand
 
00:48:58.349 --> 00:48:58.359 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that none of that
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
goes away there's still a lot oversight
 
00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
as to who can buy in the state that
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't change
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
so um that would limit what you're
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's it seems to me the guard rail is
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
already in place and I think the foreign
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
corporation guardrail is probably the
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
the largest there's a period of time and
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
expectation and and limitations to when
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
and and who it could be sold for I think
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
keeping making sure that any essentially
 
00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
profits or benefits that are provided
 
00:49:27.789 --> 00:49:27.799 align:start position:0%
from this program program go to the
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
patients of New Hampshire or to those
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
doing the work and who live in New
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and are contributing to our
 
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
economy and keeping things going in that
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
regard I think as long as we are
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
accomplishing those goals then this
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
would be a really positive bill for the
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire and certainly
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
thanks that's it thank you thank you so
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
much so we only have minutes left um I'm
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure Our obligation is to make
 
00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
some sort of a
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation um we have an option of
 
00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:02.359 align:start position:0%
either doing that now or doing it
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
another day well I wonder if you want to
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
ask if there's anybody else here who
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
would like to U say anything yes go
 
00:50:10.319 --> 00:50:12.670 align:start position:0%
would like to U say anything yes go
ahead

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:15.309 --> 00:50:15.319 align:start position:0%
sorry do we have a time
 
00:50:15.319 --> 00:50:19.950 align:start position:0%
sorry do we have a time
limit

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
suppos all right ignore what I just said
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
about time hi there oh this works good
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
um my name's Nathaniel gri and I live in
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
Sandwich New Hampshire um and um I just
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
thought I'd give you um a um to speak to
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
you as a um certified um can uh medical
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient and my own experience
 
00:50:46.589 --> 00:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
um when I first um was certified as a
 
00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
patient several years ago I was very
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
happy to um visit um one of the
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
sanctuary atcs this one was in Conway um
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
Conway and Plymouth both Sanctuary atcs
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
are about equidistant for me but I tend
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
to shop a little bit more in the Conway
 
00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
area um and I visited them and they were
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful um in um recommending um
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
the right products for me um and I made
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
my purchase um and that is other than
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
stopping in to say hello it was the last
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
time I actually went there because um
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
literally 5 miles away across the border
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
in fryberg um they have medical cannabis
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
dispensaries five of them actually and
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
the one that's actually closest to
 
00:51:34.829 --> 00:51:34.839 align:start position:0%
Conway um basically sells pretty much
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
the same product for half the price um
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
and I have to tell you that I'm um a
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
very great supporter of the um um ATC
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
and therapeutic cannabis program in New
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I really really really
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
would like to support um my local
 
00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
dispensaries um and and frankly even if
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
the dispensary was 20% more expensive I
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
would support them but um you know 100%
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
more expensive um is uh is just not
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
economical for me um and that has been
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
my experience and um you know I think
 
00:52:09.309 --> 00:52:09.319 align:start position:0%
that that's unfortunate and I think that
 
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
um that this uh particular bill would go
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
a long way to um helping the atcs be
 
00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:21.349 align:start position:0%
a long way to um helping the atcs be
more

00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
competitive again that's that's very
 
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240 align:start position:0%
helpful I've written down the the
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
pricing information you gave me because
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
I think that that plays into this in a
 
00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
very important way so thank thank you
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
yeah that was really important thanks
 
00:52:37.069 --> 00:52:37.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I almost neglected you any a
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
sure uh again for the record Wendy
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
Thomas from the town of marac I have
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
heard very clearly that there is an
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
appetite a possible appetite for opening
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
up more dispensaries just letting you
 
00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
know that I'm going to look into to that
 
00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
and get on that I get on top of that but
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
it would depend and it would rely on
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
this bill passing thank
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
you that was really important you said
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
that because of the experience with
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
tascal not being able to open up a new
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
facility because they can't Finance it
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
and that's a big problem exactly and and
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
um Matt referenced it but but when I
 
00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
testify I always say five pharmacies in
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
my town if I need pain relief I'm not
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
more than 10 minutes away from it you
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
know and there's some people in the
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
state that have to travel over an hour
 
00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
to get to their their dispensaries to
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
get their medicine and this is medicine
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
we're not talking excuse me we're not
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
you can say who you
 
00:54:16.829 --> 00:54:16.839 align:start position:0%
are uh for the record my name is Michael
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
Holt I'm the administrator of the
 
00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program with the
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:54:23.069 --> 00:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
Department doesn't have a position on
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
the bill um I don't have any you know uh
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
proactive statements but I uh do want to
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
be a resource to the subcommittee if
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
that is possible I'm just going to ask
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead you go I'm going to ask you
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
the same same question uh the bill that
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
stands do you see any change uh any
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
difficulties any loopholes in terms of
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
making this still a secure uh Endeavor
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:50.440 align:start position:0%
state the bill doesn't change any of the
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
I just state regulations or the state's
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate these entities
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:04.520 align:start position:0%
heard we've not heard any specific
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
concerns from this government or or this
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
Governor or this this committee um it's
 
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:11.240 align:start position:0%
hard to it's hard to assure that there
 
00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:14.359 align:start position:0%
are new loopholes when I don't know what
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
the loophole is that we're concerned
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
about um you know we can go back to
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the the governor's passed
 
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
vetos um I just looked up the the most
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
recent one of the recent ones from 201
 
00:55:28.829 --> 00:55:28.839 align:start position:0%
21 and his concern was that it would
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
unfairly position these three companies
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
if and when legalization would happen um
 
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:35.960 align:start position:0%
it would guarantee them these three
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
companies a a monopoly on the
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
legalization services I don't know if
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's I don't see that as being
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily true as we've seen you know
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past has uh has
 
00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
restricted atc's access to the
 
00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
legalization Market but as far as just
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
addressing what this bill does I just
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
want to clarify and assume the answer
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
would be no there is no loopholes in
 
00:56:02.349 --> 00:56:02.359 align:start position:0%
terms of security
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
true um I I can offer you
 
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
know a full quarter of uh so there's
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
15,000 patients in the program um a full
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
quarter of them have never been to a
 
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:29.240 align:start position:0%
dispensary in uh last year in uh in 24
 
00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
um on a quarterly basis less than half
 
00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
go to a
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
dispensary um so when we hear when we
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
hear talk about the revenue coming in
 
00:56:40.789 --> 00:56:40.799 align:start position:0%
from those 15,000 patients it's it is a
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
it is a small subset of uh of those
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
patients and again most of them are
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
going to Maine um we know that they tell
 
00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:49.480 align:start position:0%
us that they tell the program that every
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
day because it's uh it's far cheaper
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
what they don't know is that the medical
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
marijuana in Maine is not regulated so
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
so there's no requirements for testing
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
pesticide control Etc um that's a real
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of uh quality and
 
00:57:06.069 --> 00:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
safety uh inhaling heavy metals Etc
 
00:57:08.309 --> 00:57:08.319 align:start position:0%
there's no regulation of uh the the
 
00:57:32.109 --> 00:57:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:35.200 align:start position:0%
so if I may I so I I think the um you
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
know we're we're kind of winding down to
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
the end of our time here um I don't
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
think we're required to come back with a
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation um I will offer my
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and if if uh the rest of the
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee wants to uh tends to agree
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
with me then then I think we can come
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
back with a recommendation
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
um although though I remain wary of this
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
combination of high regulation plus
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
profit motive I think that there are it
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
some of what I've learned is a that
 
00:58:10.430 --> 00:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
there there are U pretty strong
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
guardrails in place and B uh
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
that short of sort of a sort of creeping
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
changes to those there's really not room
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
for uh big cannabis to swoop in and um
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh bastardize the the the the market and
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
the the services that are being provided
 
00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:37.000 align:start position:0%
um at the same time I'm hearing
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
potential safety issues with people
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
buying Street marijuana um price is too
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
high access is limited expansion of atcs
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
is limited um you know I have heard
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
outside of this that the survival of
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
atcs may be at risk um so I guess you
 
00:58:56.829 --> 00:58:56.839 align:start position:0%
know what I'm coming with way with is
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
that the um my potential I think that
 
00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:03.240 align:start position:0%
the the the actual real world problems
 
00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
um are significantly larger than uh my
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
concerns although I still have some
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
concerns um I guess my my uh Instinct at
 
00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.240 align:start position:0%
bill I I would do the same I my my take
 
00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
is that the guard rails are clearly
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
intact um uh and it's what we're hearing
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
the quality which is really what we want
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
we're taking care of patients uh and uh
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
the quality remains and we've heard the
 
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
difference between Maine and here and
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's I'm sad to hear there's that much
 
00:59:43.029 --> 00:59:43.039 align:start position:0%
difference but I guess that's the way it
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
is uh but with the guard rails in place
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh some of the issues that you raised
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know the availability uh and
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
competing with the street uh uh folks
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
that may be subjected to fenel uh that
 
00:59:57.789 --> 00:59:57.799 align:start position:0%
may be addressed if they have the
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
ability uh with this bill to change
 
01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
their financing and I have seen that and
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
I'll offer as I again I was on to
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
Schools board before I got a legislature
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
and saw this firsthand and the
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
constraints that it does u u impose so I
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
I think it would answer some not all but
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
it would go a part way and I think it's
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
the kind of Step it's a graduated step
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
it's a protected step uh and it's aimed
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
in the right direction and I I think it
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
would be um uh we would be remiss not to
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
take the step uh given the fact that it
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
is protected in in that way um but uh I
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
will just offer another comment I I do
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
have some
 
01:00:50.029 --> 01:00:50.039 align:start position:0%
concerns uh it is still uh categorized
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
as a illegal drug there are motions in
 
01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.430 align:start position:0%
as a illegal drug there are motions in
place

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh the doj has been held in abeyance
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
basically by presidential
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
order um that could
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
change uh and that would be a absolute
 
01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:10.150 align:start position:0%
change uh and that would be a absolute
unmitigated

01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
unmitigated
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
disaster um so uh I I'm not trying to be
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
a dark cloud but I do have some
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
concerns um with the current meu uh
 
01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
drugs being such a high-profile item in
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
political discussions that this could
 
01:01:28.559 --> 01:01:29.910 align:start position:0%
political discussions that this could
trickle

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
trickle
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
down especially with the complete uh uh
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
a redo of
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
nervous I'll make a move to pass I will
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
oh sorry do we need a roll call no all
 
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
in favor I think we are uh we were in
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
agreement thank you this was really
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful I'm glad we did this thank you
 
01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.710 align:start position:0%
wonderful I'm glad we did this thank you
very

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720 align:start position:0%

much yeah thank you everybody for making
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
the trip here uh it it has been helpful
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
I have learned a lot from the past hour
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.839 --> 01:02:54.829 align:start position:0%
