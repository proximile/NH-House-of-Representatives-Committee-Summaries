5:42 I now like to open this the
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
442 HB 442 is relative to prohibiting
 
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
payment of sub subminimum wages
 
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Warden uh do you have a
 
00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
motion yes I move in expedient to
 
00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.949 align:start position:0%
motion yes I move in expedient to
legislate

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
and representative Granger do you have a
 
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
second a
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
second and R Warren would you like to
 
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah just briefly
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard testimony on both sides but
 
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been demonstrated this
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually needed almost nobody
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
is um making minimum wage anymore and
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
it's the system seems to work we like to
 
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
not insert ourselves any more in between
 
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
employers and employees than we have to
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
let them offer the compensation that
 
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
works that attracts employees in this
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
tough uh tough Market to find
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
employees let's not mess it
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
up and would you like to speak to your
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
second representative Granger yes Mr
 
00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so I think it would hurt
 
00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:42.039 align:start position:0%
Tipp workers and uh make it harder for
 
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
smalltime restaurants to thrive and uh
 
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 align:start position:0%
we already have a pretty excessive meals
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax and uh this leads to a
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
situation where our economy is dominated
 
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
most in the food sector is dominated by
 
00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
chilies and Applebees and things like
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
that instead of uh small more Niche food
 
00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 align:start position:0%
restaurants which we would like to have
 
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
Thrive therefore I oppose this all right
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments seeing
 
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.510 align:start position:0%
are there any other comments seeing
representative

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair first of all
 
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank representative stab
 
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
and the committee I was sick for the
 
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on my bill and I she did a
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
wonderful job on on uh the Bill's behalf
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that very much um
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
couple quick points um one of the best
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
things about this bill is 11 states have
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
already um put this into law
 
00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
and we know from those States and they
 
00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 align:start position:0%
um uh vary from uh Montana to California
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
to Washington State and uh I believe
 
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
Utah so it's not like they were all blue
 
00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 align:start position:0%
States or red States it was a nice mix
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
of that and we know from that uh that
 
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
those states are doing well the
 
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
restaurants in those area are doing well
 
00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
and it turns out when uh employees make
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh decent enough way wage they uh create
 
00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
happy customers and thriving restaurants
 
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
so we know this by comparing the states
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
we also know that there have been a
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
number of Department of Labor violations
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from a number of
 
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
restaurants that have been determined to
 
00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
not be paying their workers enough and
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
in fact have to pay these large fines
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
and pay the workers at a minimum the
 
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
minimum wage uh that is actually the law
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
that at the very least despite what the
 
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
tipped subminimum wage is in this state
 
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.670 align:start position:0%
tipped subminimum wage is in this state
is

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:38.599 align:start position:0%
$3.20 an hour then in fact uh all
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
employees need to make at a minimum the
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
minimum wage and those um cases have
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
been been pretty compelling that uh
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
those that are investigated and I'm sure
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
there are many that get away with it
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
unfortunately have had to uh address
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
this issue so we know that in fact uh
 
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
plenty of workers make low wages at the
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
subminimum or minimum wage and should be
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
paid that and so there should be no
 
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560 align:start position:0%
difficulty to pay them at the base level
 
00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:13.879 align:start position:0%
what other low agage workers make and
 
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is the subminimum wage at a minimum
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
and then tips would be on top um we also
 
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 align:start position:0%
know that one of the reasons why we
 
00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 align:start position:0%
struggle to have workers in our
 
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
restaurants uh is because many jobs
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
along the border of our state they
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
realize they can make
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh more money at the neighboring states
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
maybe that's an argument that's better
 
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
for another the minimum wage bill but it
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
does um impact this as well if you work
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
in Vermont or Maine or um Massachusetts
 
00:07:47.149 --> 00:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
in general your wages are better because
 
00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:49.759 align:start position:0%
at a at the minimum they're going to be
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
paid the 13 15 an hour at the very at
 
00:07:57.869 --> 00:07:57.879 align:start position:0%
the very least um I'm blanking on one of
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
my other points
 
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
when I remember it I if we are still
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
talking about it I will uh raise that
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
point at this time but um there are
 
00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
plenty of good reasons that that we need
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
this bill and the free market is one of
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
them turns out uh you know uh one of the
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
things that isn't always taken care of
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
in the free market is that we choose
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
workers over for lack of a better word
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
greed if you have the ability to have
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
more money versus less money and you're
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
in control of the money turns out you're
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
going to take more money not everyone
 
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
does that we oh that is my other point
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
um uh Alex Ray who is the biggest
 
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
restaurant tour in New Hampshire he owns
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
the Common Man family of restaurants not
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
a Democrat or Republican very much an
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
independent he's been a part of the
 
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
movement to ditch the subminimum wage as
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
a concept um and then I'll throw in I I
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
I pretty sure you raised this point the
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
only reason why we have a sub minimum
 
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
wage in the first place is when uh
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
slavery ended it was a way to make
 
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
workers predominantly African-American
 
00:09:11.949 --> 00:09:11.959 align:start position:0%
workers in um the hospitality industry
 
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh make them dependent on the uh
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
Goodwill of the customers so it's still
 
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
created a dependency that um still
 
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:23.560 align:start position:0%
exists to this day I mean we went from
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
zero wages at that time to $3.20 in this
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
in the time of 150 years so just at the
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
base level no other country on Earth has
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
it like this tipping culture is tipping
 
00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:37.079 align:start position:0%
culture that's not what this bill is
 
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
addressing and that way tipping will
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
still happen so just at a base level to
 
00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
have the minimum wage available to
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
workers and you know the free market can
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
account for that if an employer can't
 
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
pay at the base
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour maybe that's a restaurant
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to stay open that is
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
the harsh reality of of a a free Market
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
but it's maybe the best thing I will say
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
we have great restaurants in the state
 
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
and great restaurant tours um but to do
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
so on the backs of workers at a sub rate
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
is just something that um should not be
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
the case and I hope we become the 12th
 
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:17.240 align:start position:0%
state to uh ditch the sub minimum wage
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you ma'am president K
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a tiny little restaurant in
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
my town of New Market and I've talk to
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
the owner and he pays his help $10 an
 
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
hour none of this subminimum weighing
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
and they get tips and and it works uh I
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't know why an industry that is very
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
successful it's our third largest uh
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream that the the8 and a half%
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
tax on it is the restaurant industry is
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
very successful why they can't afford to
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
pay the minimum wage at least and let
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the chips flow as they are and belong to
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
the customer I know there's some
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
conversation in Washington about uh not
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
taxing tips anymore so you know if that
 
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:08.240 align:start position:0%
happens then this would even be better
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
you be able have your weight staff uh
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
not have a turnover in the restaurant uh
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
be able to afford to pay the rent and
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
maybe even for child care and you know
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
so they'd have a secure earnings of 725
 
00:11:24.509 --> 00:11:24.519 align:start position:0%
an hour uh and then the tips which is
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
because they provide good service not
 
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
because they you know that's a job that
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
all the employer to take the take the
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
tips and use it to pay their wage we
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't do that with other Industries uh I
 
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
also want to point off for the benefit
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
of my colleague that our restaurant
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
industry unlike many other places uh
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
they get 3% of that tax they collect
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
from the customer you put the you put
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the you pay the check and they send them
 
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
their uh the tax in every month but
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
first they take out 3% and that's about
 
00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
12 or15 million a year other states
 
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't play that so so um you know I have
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
nothing against the restaurant industry
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
I I enjoy going to a restaurant from
 
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.120 align:start position:0%
time to time my $100 a year but um you
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
know this is something that we really
 
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:11.959 align:start position:0%
should evolve away from thank you Mr
 
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:13.720 align:start position:0%

Aller

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
rate and representative fton do you have
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
a motion to be made yes I move
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate motions been
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
made inexpedient to legislate is there a
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
second I'll second representative Drago
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
for a second representative farington
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
can you speak to your motion yes sir I
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe that while the bill may be
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned the actual effects of
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
the bill would be harmful that the bill
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
for the people that the bill seeks to
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
benefit and it's important to know what
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
a minimum wage law does what it does is
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
it says it's illegal to employ somebody
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
who skills don't justify in this case a
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
wage of $15 an hour and wages have
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
meaning behind their value the the value
 
00:14:58.269 --> 00:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
of a wage doesn't just fall from Heaven
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's a value behind the wage and
 
00:15:03.629 --> 00:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to the value that the
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
worker produces a firm will not employ
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
an employee unless they can produce at
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
least the value of their wage and what
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is over the course of
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
time it would raise that to $15 an hour
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
and so a natural effect would be
 
00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment for low-skilled
 
00:15:26.749 --> 00:15:26.759 align:start position:0%
employees and representative Drago thank
 
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
you representative drgo Do you have a
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
comments to your
 
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
second NOP I think he did a good job
 
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
explaining it all right representative
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
stab thank you Mr chair um first I I
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
would like to thank my fellow committee
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
members for all their thoughtful
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
questions when I introduced this bill I
 
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate your interest and
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
attentiveness I I believe that it is p
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
time for New Hampshire to restore our
 
00:15:52.749 --> 00:15:52.759 align:start position:0%
minimum wage law and to raise our
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to a level that is
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
competitive with surrounding states
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
wages have risen in the last few years
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
years because most of our Workforce
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
lives an hour or less away from a state
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
where they are guaranteed a minimum wage
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
of $14 and $15 an hour and we currently
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
have a worker shortage our current
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
default wage of $725 cents an hour sends
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
a message to our workers and workers who
 
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
are considering moving to to the state
 
00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
that they are not valued we know that
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
there are 60,000 New Hampshire workers
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
who are making less than $15 an hour in
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
our state and that they tend to be
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
people who work in jobs that are
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
important to all Granite Staters child
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
care workers home health aids the people
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
who keep the grocery stores and
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
convenience stores open so you can get a
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
gallon of milk when you need it the
 
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
people who hand you your coffee at the
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
drive up window in the morning who do
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
more for us productivity in one shift
 
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
than most CEOs will do in their
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
lifetime and there are many others they
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
are vital to our economy and our quality
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
of life and they deserve a fair wage so
 
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
I will be voting against the itl motion
 
00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:06.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your
 
00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
lir uh thank you Mr chair just one thing
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
I'd like to point out is that over the
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
years well I've only been on this
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
committee for this is my third year but
 
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:19.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of the bills that passed last
 
00:17:21.309 --> 00:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
year kind of went with the with the cola
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
right with the cost of living and uh for
 
00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
whatever reason this one
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't and I know it's it's it's
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
initially seems like a big jump from the
 
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
725 to I believe what the 10 or whatever
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
the next increment is but if we would
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
have maybe kept up a little bit over the
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
past 20 some odd years since it was
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
brought up to 725 it might not hurt so
 
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
much and again I know that people are
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
already making more so why not bring it
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
up I I understand the reasoning for not
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
bringing it up to some degree but uh it
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
just seems like for all the uh reasons
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
that representative stab said and I
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with the arguments either
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily but um even if we just
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
brought things up to with the cost of
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
living at least to some degree it would
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
help a lot of people thank you thank you
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
sir representative Granger thank you Mr
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
chair I got out of high school in 2008
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
and that was a high school dropout this
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
is Story Time with Granger and 2008 was
 
00:18:21.789 --> 00:18:21.799 align:start position:0%
not a very good time to be entering the
 
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
job market and I remember having an
 
00:18:25.789 --> 00:18:25.799 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard time finding a job
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
because I was competing with bank CEOs
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
for retail jobs that wasn't an easy
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
position to be in but I was living at
 
00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
home and my expenses were incredibly low
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
and I would have killed for a job that
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
paid $2 an hour just so I could have
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
something on my resume but I could not
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
do that because new New York had at the
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
I lived in New York at the time suei uh
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
New York at the time had a minimum wage
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
law that prevented me from being able to
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
get any employment and we are not always
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
going to live in good
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
times and I feel I have a lot of empathy
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
for my colleague over here who's in a
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
younger generation than I am and there's
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some tough times
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
ahead and there's going to be kids
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
getting out of high school they're going
 
00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
to be dropping out of high school like I
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
did who need a job and this will just be
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
an obstacle and as well-intentioned as
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
it is it hasn't always been well
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
intentioned that back in the past they
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
used to push minimum wages specifically
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
to prevent certain people from having
 
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
certain jobs and competing with other
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
people that was the historical intent
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
and honestly it did a pretty good job of
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
it at the time but uh I I don't want to
 
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
um belabor the point but I do not want
 
00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
to inflict a minimum wage on the young
 
00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
people there's already a sense among the
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
Zoomers Generation Z as they're called
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
that the economy is rigged against them
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
to favor the elderly at the expense of
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
the young and can you really blame them
 
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
considering all the things that they've
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
went through in their high school years
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the Corona virus lockdowns with
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
everything else that we've gone on with
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
the economy that it is I don't think
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
that previous generations intentionally
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
rigged the game against young people but
 
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is a minimum
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
wage what it actually does is rig the
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
game against young people therefore I
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
fully and wholeheartedly support an itl
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you thank you sir
 
00:20:12.149 --> 00:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
representative bashard thank you Mr
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
chair uh just to add to representative
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
star's uh
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
testimony I I will not be able to
 
00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
support the itl motion because we by
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
increasing the minimum wage we can lift
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
Working Families out of poverty and
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
strengthen our middle class class this
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
not only improves Financial stability
 
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.110 align:start position:0%
not only improves Financial stability
for

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
individuals but also eases the burden on
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
social support programs when workers
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
receive a wage that meets basic living
 
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
standards their Reliance on government
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
assistance diminishes this means fewer
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
resources are spent on public assistance
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately saving taxpayer dollars that
 
00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
can be invested in other critical areas
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
in our community
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
additionally increasing the minimum wage
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
enhances worker productivity and
 
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
retention employees who feel valued are
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
more likely to be engaged and committed
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
leading to reduce turnover and improve
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
efficiencies this has a positive impact
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
on the overall quality of services
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
provided and the economic Vitality of
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
our state thank you Mr chair thank you I
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate it representative Schultz
 
00:21:30.029 --> 00:21:30.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just want to say
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
that this topic in particular is one of
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
those that isn't not that isn't partisan
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
um it is actually a very mainstream view
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
to want a decent enough minimum wage and
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
this is true a majority of Republicans
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
in every District across the state
 
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
anytime we've pulled it in 2008 until
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
this year it is wildly popular and
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's because the rank and file voter
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
in this state regardless of of party
 
00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960 align:start position:0%
knows that we shouldn't have jobs that
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
don't pay you enough to afford the
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
basics they know because either people
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
in their family or themselves um the
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
majority of people earning low wages are
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
women often with kids uh in you know
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
from their 20s till their 50s and uh
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
what good is a job in New Hampshire if
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
you can't feed your kids pay the rent do
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
the basics we're not asking for some
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
Pathway to to wealth here we're just
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
asking that all jobs and I agree with uh
 
00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
representative Fairington in this sense
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
the value of a wage should be equal to
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
the value of what it takes to live in
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire plain and simple the
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
modesty of a decent wage should be the
 
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
bare minimum of what we have uh and it
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
would be nice if employers all just did
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
this but um that's why we do what we do
 
00:22:55.799 --> 00:22:57.230 align:start position:0%
this but um that's why we do what we do
thank

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
you thank representative McKenzie sir
 
00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.789 align:start position:0%
you thank representative McKenzie sir
thank

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:04.269 --> 00:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
you I think you can make a pretty good
 
00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
argument that um and I've heard this in
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
the room before that nobody's being paid
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage in the state of New
 
00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the 725 is a federal minimum
 
00:23:15.549 --> 00:23:15.559 align:start position:0%
wage we decided a few years ago to
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate our minimum wage in the state
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so number one we don't
 
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:23.480 align:start position:0%
have one and we probably should but
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
secondly looking at the bottom
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
occupations in the state there is no
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
body making that I can see at least away
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Employment
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
Security people who are making 725 an
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
hour they're not making it so if there
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
was if the bill said we would pay $10 an
 
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
hour or $12 an hour would that make any
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
difference I don't think it would
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
because what this comes down to is the
 
00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
employers want the opportunity to be
 
00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
able to adjust wages up and down with
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the economy and that's a that's a roller
 
00:24:02.669 --> 00:24:02.679 align:start position:0%
coaster for for workers who are in this
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
economy trying to
 
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
survive now when you also when you look
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the low wage workers in the state the
 
00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
people who would most benefit by a $15
 
00:24:14.029 --> 00:24:14.039 align:start position:0%
an hour as my colleague said are those
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
they cluster in certain areas in child
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
care and in uh in uh food preparation
 
00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
and weight staff and cashiers and people
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
like that who are at the low end and in
 
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
the in people who are in those
 
00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
the in people who are in those
profession

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
who are servicing the state by the
 
00:24:34.909 --> 00:24:34.919 align:start position:0%
thousands are not working one job
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
they're not working one job they're
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
working two jobs three jobs and that's
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's where we are in New Hampshire and
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
let me say every day a 100,000 people
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
leave the state of New Hampshire to go
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts to
 
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:53.240 align:start position:0%
work is this one of the reasons why it's
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
a low minimum wage one of the reasons
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
why when they can just slip over the
 
00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:00.279 align:start position:0%
border and make more money doing the
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
same job so from an economic perspective
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
does this make sense are we losing
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
people are we draining the the pond for
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because of because of this
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
system and finally I would just say that
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right it's not all
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
kids who are working for minimum wage
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people in this
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
economy who are working for minimum wage
 
00:25:26.909 --> 00:25:26.919 align:start position:0%
in fortunately at 725 or8 or N9 to $10
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
an hour and some of of them are
 
00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
childcare workers and childcare workers
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
in this state are the most
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
neglected most valuable group of people
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
and the most neglected in our economy so
 
00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
we need to deal with this in terms of
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
the broad economy uh and look at issues
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
like this and the impact that these are
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
having and a low minimum wage in the
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
state or no minimum wage in the state is
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
a is a component of our Economic
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
Development pece thank you Mr chairman
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
comments so I I
 
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
I just have a
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
personal Flanigan representative sir
 
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.200 align:start position:0%
over to you thank you Mr chairman just
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
as uh I don't know what you call it but
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
my daughter owns a
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
preschool and their their employees are
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
not paid minimum wage and if uh they
 
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
have a child they can go to the
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
preschool without any costs so not that
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
I want to correct representative
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I just want to clarify that not
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
all people in the childcare in industry
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
are paid even $15 I think she's in the
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
20s so
 
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
um just uh you know providing some
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
clarification thank
 
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for the comment and I I
 
00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a quick comment so I
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
I worked for $13 an hour four years ago
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what we got paid at uh
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
at crotchett Mountain and as a result of
 
00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
that the Mountain closed 40% of of its
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
operating hours it closed Mondays it
 
00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
closed Tuesdays it closed all nights
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
except for Friday and Saturday night so
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
when you add it all up the hours it was
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
a 40% reduction in the operating time of
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the mountain the reason was they
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
couldn't hire
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
anyone no one wanted to work for $13 an
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
hour except for Knuckleheads like me
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.350 align:start position:0%
hour except for Knuckleheads like me
who's

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:22.360 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
retired and so what they ended up doing
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
is they
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
increased their minimum wage from $113
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
to I believe it was 21 but it might have
 
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
to I believe it was 21 but it might have
been

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
20 and that was three years
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
ago uh when they had their hiring fair
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
in September for this
 
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
season there was minuscule openings and
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
that's because everyone came back and so
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
my point on the minimum wage is that the
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
market drove that and rather than people
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
leaving the state they came to
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
State because the the company recognized
 
00:28:05.789 --> 00:28:05.799 align:start position:0%
that they were way out of line and now
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
we're doing great so I I understand uh
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's point but I my
 
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
experience a little bit different are
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
comments represent lry are you
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
suggesting sir the law of supply and
 
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.990 align:start position:0%
suggesting sir the law of supply and
demand

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
worked I I didn't say that but that
 
00:28:29.669 --> 00:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
would seem to apply okay thank you
 
00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:30.830 align:start position:0%
would seem to apply okay thank you
representive

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
representive
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
Solomon that that was a very good
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
example of uh how the market can work
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
and the market does work some of the
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
time um the minimum wage fills in when
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
the Market's not working and
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
um we will still have supply and demand
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
um employers paying what they need to to
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
get good employees and it is often well
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
above minimum wage even if the minimum
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
wage is $15 an hour um
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
but as has been pointed out there are
 
00:29:09.149 --> 00:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
some lines of work um where the
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
employers um don't pay the 10 1215 an
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
hour and those are the folks that we're
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
trying to um uh address here thank you
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%

I closed the hearing on HB 726 and open
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB

744 on HB 744 U there was an additional
 
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
information that was being gathered and
 
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
collected and we agreed last week to
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.029 align:start position:0%
HB 542 and so we will not exec uh HB 744
this

00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
morning and I close the hearing on
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
7:44 I'd like to open the hearing now on
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
HB uh
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
378 relative to an employes unused uh
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
time and representative proud do you
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a motion thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:20.279 align:start position:0%
move in expedient to
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
legislate the motion on the table is in
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate we have a war a
 
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
second and we have a second M
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative proud would you like to
 
00:32:30.509 --> 00:32:30.519 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
your to your um motion yes thank you Mr
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
chairman um this bill would add
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
regulations to businesses requiring
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
strict accounting of leave uh it's not
 
00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
clear how this would interact with
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
companies that have unlimited leave
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
policies um Massachusetts where I work
 
00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
had did a similar policy for sick leave
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago uh the net result is
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
my company revoked its unlimited
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
untracked and no paperwork sick leave
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
and went to a strict accounting system
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
to the detriment of of everyone
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
involved uh this bill would turn uh the
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
the leave balance instantly into a
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
liability on the balance sheet of
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
companies potentially affecting their
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
credit uh additionally this bill uh has
 
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the vibe of an expost facto law
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
it's not limited to leave earned after
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
the effective date of the bill it would
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
actually affect leave earned before the
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
effective date of the bill as well uh
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
this sets up time up a time bomb for
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
companies that aren't paying attention
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
to changes in law if they've previously
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
had a large uh acrel allowed in their
 
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.750 align:start position:0%
had a large uh acrel allowed in their
policy

00:33:28.750 --> 00:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
and while the proposed amendment limits
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
this to a month and a half of payout
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
that only limits the damage it really
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the nature of why it's a
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
bad idea um this bill would also make it
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
harder for uh business owners and as
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
experience has shown me potentially
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
worse for workers as well doe their
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
employers understandable reactions law
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
and so for these reasons I recommend
 
00:33:50.669 --> 00:33:50.679 align:start position:0%
finding this bill in expedient to
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you for your comments
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
represent waren do you have a comments
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
represent K sir the floor is yours thank
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um of course I have I do
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
have an amendment which i' I'd hope we
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
would take into consideration it cleaned
 
00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:06.519 align:start position:0%
up a few of the things okay and I'm and
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm reminded of a conversation I had
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
maybe it was last term or the term
 
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
before when the gentleman uh Mr proud
 
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
told me that because he worked in
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he had have benefited from
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
their law when uh something happened in
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
his vacation would have done would have
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
gone way he end up getting paid so it's
 
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.829 align:start position:0%
gone way he end up getting paid so it's
a

00:34:25.829 --> 00:34:25.839 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
little uh you know do you like it when
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
it works for you it doesn't like it when
 
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
it might not work for you that's that's
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's a concern for me but uh I did I
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
did work hard in this amendment to uh
 
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
clean things up uh again it's only it
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
only takes effect Under The Limited
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
circumstances solely when there's a
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
layoff sale or closure of the business
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
and I understand that there was some
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
agreement uh among my Republican
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues that when it when a business
 
00:34:55.629 --> 00:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
is sold or or or it closes they should
 
00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
do the right thing and pay the uh uh the
 
00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
unused vacation time uh but a layoff is
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
another occurrence that's beyond the
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
control of the employee unanticipated
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
and allows them no opportunity to use
 
00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
that which they have earned I want to
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
make clear this is part of compensation
 
00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:13.960 align:start position:0%
you earn it it's part of your it's part
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
of your pay and so under these limited
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances when this happened you
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
would get paid and and the law doesn't
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
take effect until January 1 plenty of
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
time for any employer to become aware of
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't require a massive overhaul
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
of any policy it just says uh that you
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
can't do this you can't keep that money
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
that the person earned whether it's $100
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
or $500 or $1,000 as the examples I've
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
shown you you can't keep it when when
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
they had no opportunity to take the time
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
because the actions of the employer
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's all it does it doesn't break it
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't break anybody's budget you you
 
00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
when you have your policy to you're
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
going to have vacation time whatever way
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
you're doing it you assume that it's
 
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
going to be used and it should be used
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
but if it if you deny the person the
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use it you really should
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
pay them and that's that's really all I
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
have to say about it uh it would be nice
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
to defeat this uh itl and get get back
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
to an OTP
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
otpa uh and that would be the right
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%

geographic region in nurses
 
01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
contracts nursing agencies bypass these
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
laws by placing non-compete articles in

provide Staffing
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
services this legislation is intended to
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
close that

those based outside of New Hampshire are
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
public the nurses are unaware that they
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
are under a non-compete clauses in their
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
contracts nurses working for an agency
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
are commonly assigned to multiple organ
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
organizations this creates a network of

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
them when assigned to multiple
 
01:05:56.109 --> 01:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
organizations unless the organization is
 
01:05:59.589 --> 01:05:59.599 align:start position:0%
willing to pay the agency a substantial
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
amount of money to puras to purchase the
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
nurse from
 
01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:07.799 align:start position:0%
them not only are traditional Health
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities impacted increasing
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
General Health care
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
costs but also Public Schools County
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
State and correctional facilities are
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
also impacted resulting in agencies
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
profiting from the
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers behind me are several nurses
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
that have been impacted by this and if
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
you have questions
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
regarding what has happened to them they
 
01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
will be testifying later on so in
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
summary I urge you to pass HB 386 and I
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
have a letter to give to you after some
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representive
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
solivan thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:07:04.109 --> 01:07:04.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
um all of us are um delegates for our um
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
counties and um all of us are involved
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
with uh County nursing homes um can you
 
01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:18.920 align:start position:0%
tell us what impact um these um uh
 
01:07:21.029 --> 01:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
non-compete clauses have had on our
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
County nursing
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
homes the one that I'm familiar with is
 
01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
hillsb girl nursing home and they have a
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
shortage of nurses and so they staff
 
01:07:34.269 --> 01:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
them with nurses from nursing
 
01:07:38.349 --> 01:07:38.359 align:start position:0%
agencies and so what happens if like for
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
Bedford um nursing home a Hillsboro
 
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
nursing home um they like the nurse she
 
01:07:50.069 --> 01:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
likes them they want to have a marriage
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
between them but she can't leave the
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
agency and the county cannot afford the
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars that is offered to
 
01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
buy her from the
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
agency so they're left in a very
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
impacted area followup for followup
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
sir my understanding is the agency
 
01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
nurses um cost the county a lot more
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
than a um nurse on staff that's
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
correct and um there for would I be
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
correct in thinking that um these um uh
 
01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:34.679 align:start position:0%
non-com compete Clauses cost the
 
01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
counties our County
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a lot of money as well that's
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
01:08:43.229 --> 01:08:43.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you good question
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative Granger uh thank you Mr
 
01:08:47.070 --> 01:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
chair so is it am I correct in
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
understanding that the general premise
 
01:08:49.229 --> 01:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to increase the
 
01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:51.400 align:start position:0%
liquidity in the in the nurse labor
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
market that's correct so in if that were
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
the case can I do a follow-up
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
for followup uh would would you mind if
 
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
it was only applied to organizations
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
that accept public funds or Medicaid or
 
01:09:06.749 --> 01:09:06.759 align:start position:0%
things like that I'm I I I can't answer
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
that right now maybe the people behind
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
me are able to do that thank you
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
represent Prout uh thank you um would
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
this only apply to someone changing jobs
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
or um or would a non-compete clause for
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
simultaneous employment still be allowed
 
01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
so that they can't like Moonlight
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere else for example would that
 
01:09:31.149 --> 01:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
prohibition still be allowed on my
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is if they've signed with
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
an agency they're with the agency and
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
they cannot work outside of their
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
contract and their the network of
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that the agency has
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:44.510 align:start position:0%
organizations that the agency has
contracted

01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
with I don't know if that's kind of
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
indirect but y I don't think they can I
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think they can Moonlight for a
 
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:54.120 align:start position:0%
followup yep so but does this bill
 
01:09:55.950 --> 01:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
address only the their trying to change
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
employer situation or does it also
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
prohibit or or make it so that they
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
can't have a Moonlighting Prohibition in
 
01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
can't have a Moonlighting Prohibition in
the

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
contract I I I think that they cannot
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
leave the agency itself so it prohibits
 
01:10:12.669 --> 01:10:12.679 align:start position:0%
them from seeking employment outside of
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
their agency thank you okay
 
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative kill thank you Mr chair
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative priest for
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in the
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
conventional uh temporary employment
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
Market Market they often have temped
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
perm where if the employee Works 6
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
months uh as as a signed by the agency
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
they can be car they can be hired a
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
direct hire is this anything that
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
happens in the nursing uh agencies um I
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question but there's
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
people behind me that are are able to do
 
01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:49.550 align:start position:0%
people behind me that are are able to do
thank

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
you repres
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman um I if I
 
01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly these nursing
 
01:11:02.590 --> 01:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
um agencies yeah are similar to pardon
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
me head hunters for the nursing industry
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
in other words versus in regular um job
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
field you know you go the people solicit
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
work for you you go there on a temporary
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
basis but in those
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
instances for no other words you do
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
belong to the Head Hunter in other words
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
you got the contact and you got the work
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
through them so what you're saying to me
 
01:11:28.709 --> 01:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
in this regards and correcting if I'm
 
01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:32.120 align:start position:0%
wrong is that uh so if you're a nurse
 
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
and these people have jobs for
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
you um you can't go around the agency
 
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
and you'd like to be able to go around
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
the agency that's correct that's correct
 
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
if you want let's say let's say a
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
nurse is hired by or is hired by the
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
agency she signs the contract they
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
assign her to a particular Health Care
 
01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
Facility the health care facility
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
through a direct hire would give her a
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
higher salary and probably better
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
benefits but she can't leave the agency
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
because she's because of the no compete
 
01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
clause in her contract followup for a
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
followup yes sir thank you Mr chairman
 
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
so so basically as you have an agreement
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
between two parties and you don't like
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the agreement and what you want to do is
 
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
I us create a law that says you can
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
break the agreement that says you belong
 
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
to them because they found you the job
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
they help you out with benefits or
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the case may be based on those
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
contracts and you your your constituents
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
don't like that meaning the nurses they
 
01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to go out on their own or they want
 
01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
to get a full-time job at the company
 
01:12:43.310 --> 01:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
that they're temping at well I think
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's broader than that the
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
cost of this is costing the taxpayers
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
the the nursing facilities much more
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
because the agencies are charging a much
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
higher rate for the nurses I get it and
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
the nurses are being compensated at a
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
much lower rate than they would be if
 
01:13:09.629 --> 01:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
they were out on their own I I think
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's a I think it's an issue of not
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what is in their
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
contracts and
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
basically um signing an agreement that
 
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
are not familiar not being told the
 
01:13:27.709 --> 01:13:27.719 align:start position:0%
particulars of their contract at the
 
01:13:30.669 --> 01:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
beginning so representative
 
01:13:32.910 --> 01:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
Alani thank you Mr chairman you stated
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
that they sign their contract before
 
01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
they start work do they not read the
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
contract before start they start
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
work I I I can't answer that for the
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
nurses represent D sylvestro and then
 
01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan thank you sir
 
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
sounds as though once they get into the
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
ageny it's a way that they know they can
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
get a job they're out of state they come
 
01:13:57.310 --> 01:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to to obtain a job and
 
01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
then once they hear as you I think you
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
said earlier the employer likes them
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
they want to work here so it's really a
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
question um it takes their Liberty and
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
their choices away in order to try to
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
improve themselves by getting a
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
permanent job and then helps us in the
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
state to lower our costs through our
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
County that's
 
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
County that's
correct

01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
Sol just to
 
01:14:26.270 --> 01:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
clarify it uh I believe you you
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
testified earlier that the non-complete
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
Clause is not in a um uh contract
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
between the nurse and the um agency or
 
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
the nurse and the um the facility but
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's between the agency and the facility
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
so the nurse doesn't sign it the nurse
 
01:14:46.030 --> 01:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't read it is that correct that's
 
01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm sorry just to clarify and
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
I've got you but I'm that's a great
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
question so I'm I ask it a different way
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
because so I'm a nurse I go to the
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
agency I sign a contract with the agency
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
is there a non-compete clause in that
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
agency you know I'm confused myself
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now between the agency and the
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
organization the nurses it's not in the
 
01:15:19.719 --> 01:15:21.229 align:start position:0%
organization the nurses it's not in the
nurses

01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
contract okay okay good thank you for
 
01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
asking so that's a big thing
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Granger and then
 
01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159 align:start position:0%
I've got a couple on this side I've got
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
you tracking but representative Granger
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
you're next oh thank you Mr chair so so
 
01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:34.239 align:start position:0%
would this be retroactive so for
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
instance if there's already a contract
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
signed of this nature would that be
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
invalidated by this I believe so thank
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
you and representative stop thank you Mr
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
chair um typically how long are are
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
these contracts between the nurses and
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the agencies for is it a year six months
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
I I can't answer but there's people
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
behind me they can okay thank you thank
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
you and are there any questions did I
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
miss someone represent
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh thank you for coming in
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
front of US Representative and uh the
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
question I have is how does this impact
 
01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
the temp agencies in general is this
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
does this just C the nursing out of that
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
because it's the practice in for temp
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
workers in temporary agencies is
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
generally this you you hire a temp and
 
01:16:25.990 --> 01:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
then if you want want the temp you buy
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
buy the temp out from the uh from the
 
01:16:32.110 --> 01:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
agency and I you know we used to do that
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
um you get a chance to see the person
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
see how they work and then and then the
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
agency uh will give you a price in terms
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
of that so does this affect that at all
 
01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:43.639 align:start position:0%
and the other thing I I you could
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
profile let let's do one at a
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
time sorry one question at a time well
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
that my curious about how this impacts
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
the rest of the uh the if it involves
 
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the temp AG gencies as well if it's
 
01:16:58.750 --> 01:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
just a carve out okay I I believe it's
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
just a carveout addressing this
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
you Library thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh so I'm the
 
01:17:12.189 --> 01:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
one of the business owners in the bunch
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
here and one of my questions is um how
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
does this affect the agency you know
 
01:17:18.990 --> 01:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
down the road if all the nurses were to
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
to jump ship if you would um and and
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
left the agency and just went direct to
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
work for the facility
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
what would happen then to the agency
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
would they go out of business or what I
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
don't think they would go out of
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
business but I don't think they would be
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
getting the profits that they have in
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
the past okay follow up please so if
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
they weren't getting the profits that
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
they had previously would they then
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
maybe be not interested in continuing
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to trying to make sure
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's protected I can't answer
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
that question cuz I'm not I don't know
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
the ageny thank you representative
 
01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.790 align:start position:0%
the ageny thank you representative
Granger

01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
Granger
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair is this intended
 
01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
specifically is is it designed with the
 
01:18:03.070 --> 01:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
temp agencies in mind primarily like the
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
nursing agencies
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
or just for the nurses agencies just the
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
nurses agencies right okay represent
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
waren thank
 
01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:15.080 align:start position:0%
you question is a basic business
 
01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
question whether it's the County nursing
 
01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
home or another medical provider
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
facility you I think you believe I
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
believe you stated that they they these
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
SE hiring a these hiring hospitals or
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities actually pay more for
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
a nurse through the uh agency than they
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
would if they hired that person directly
 
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:40.280 align:start position:0%
why is it why would these employers pay
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
more than they have to you explain that
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
from a business from a business
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint because they can't find
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
anybody around that's the
 
01:18:52.870 --> 01:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
reason followup followup sir is it also
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
possible that some of these employers
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
prefer uh that type of arrangement
 
01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
because it's easier for those people
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's easier to fire those people if
 
01:19:06.189 --> 01:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
they're needs um are reduced for staff
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
for example it's easier to let a
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
contractor go than it is to let go an
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
employee is that I can't answer that for
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
the organizations but it doesn't just
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
affect Health Care it affects Public
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
Schools Correctional Facilities anything
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:27.239 --> 01:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
problem um thank you I think I
 
01:19:32.669 --> 01:19:32.679 align:start position:0%
understand the problem statement is that
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
essentially these these nursing staff
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
agencies are including these causes in
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the contract with I I guess the the
 
01:19:42.030 --> 01:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
problem could be restated as excessive
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
buyout fees that basically make it
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
impractical to actually execute that
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
clause for most organizations um and I
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
agree that that there's a that sounds
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
like a problem there especially as
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
relates to um the County nursing homes
 
01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
and such but I and a little bit to um uh
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
my colleague's question there is I can't
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
imagine that the nursing agencies won't
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
react to this if they if we prohibit
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
this Clause they'll change the structure
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
of the contract in some other way
 
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to make their money
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
somehow do we have any idea of what
 
01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to do instead are they
 
01:20:14.870 --> 01:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
going to increase the base rate are they
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
going to try some other Clause I mean
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the secondary effects
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
if we pass this do you have any
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
information on that well I I I don't
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
have the information on that but I did
 
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.229 align:start position:0%
have the information on that but I did
have

01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
correspondence um and I don't believe I
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
brought her with me and I'll be happy to
 
01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
share that with you that there has been
 
01:20:39.669 --> 01:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
a new
 
01:20:42.189 --> 01:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
rule that has been
 
01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
pregated um here it is and I'll leave
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
this with
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
you I mean this is just not a New
 
01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem this is this is a
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
National problem with these
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
agencies um and this this is with the uh
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
Federal Trade Commission and they were
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh communicating to
 
01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
me that um the FTC was kind of banding
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
non-compete clauses and this rule hasn't
 
01:21:21.790 --> 01:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
got into effect yet but it's on the
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
docket to be in effect okay followup for
 
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
a followup do you know if that rule
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
that's under contemplation would apply
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
to this situation because this isn't a
 
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
standard non-compete situation because
 
01:21:36.669 --> 01:21:36.679 align:start position:0%
it is the contract between the agency
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the health care facility not a
 
01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
standard non-compete that would be
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
between the agency and EMP I can't
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
answer that but there's others that
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
might be able okay representative
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you thank you Mr chair do
 
01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
you happen to know what percentage of
 
01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
nurses are hired through an agency I do
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
not have that
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:58.840 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for asking answering
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
question you and thank you for putting
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
up with me and there's again more
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable people who have been
 
01:22:07.950 --> 01:22:07.960 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by this sitting behind
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
me so thank you again all right thank
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
Peterson if you could introduce yourself
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
sir and then uh where you're from that
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
would be great yes um my name is Rick
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
Peterson well it's okay just not wait
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
to Yes uh my name is Rick
 
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
Peterson I have been Associated and an
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
owner of Interim HealthCare a
 
01:22:56.830 --> 01:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
supplemental Staffing Agency for 47
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
years I think we're the definition of a
 
01:23:02.350 --> 01:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
family business here in New Hampshire
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're a licensed Home Health agency we
 
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
provide Staffing also to hospitals
 
01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
nursing homes and schools and we've been
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
recognized by CMS as a Five Star Agency
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
which is the highest rating for Quality
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
that you can
 
01:23:25.629 --> 01:23:25.639 align:start position:0%
get HB 386 as proposed is mostly
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
fine one section however is grossly
 
01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
unfair a facility who we staff who
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
chooses to hire our employee when I say
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
our employee it's not ownership but an
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
employee that we sent
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
them uh just free and clear after we
 
01:23:51.310 --> 01:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
have spent really thousands of dollars
 
01:23:54.990 --> 01:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
through indeed and other hiring uh
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh software programs we've recruited
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
we've interviewed we've done reference
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
checking we've done drug testing
 
01:24:05.629 --> 01:24:05.639 align:start position:0%
criminal background checking orientation
 
01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
a skills review and finally we placed
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
that person and just to clear up the uh
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor we do not have a contract with
 
01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.790 align:start position:0%
sponsor we do not have a contract with
the

01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
nurse the
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
legislation only covers staffing
 
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
agencies for nurses and nurses
 
01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
AIDS those agencies providing technical
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
legal clerical or light industrial are
 
01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.110 align:start position:0%
legal clerical or light industrial are
not

01:24:34.110 --> 01:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
included seems to me this legislation
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
we look at this a little bit differently
 
01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
and con consider this and this is as
 
01:24:58.030 --> 01:24:58.040 align:start position:0%
crazy as it sounds but facilities should
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
be opposed to this
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and the reason I say opposed
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the representatives
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
over here said well what's going to
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
occur if if uh we do pass this
 
01:25:13.109 --> 01:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and I can tell you
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
potentially what can occur if we go to
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
that expense and we staff a facility and
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
the first time in they I guess the word
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
could be poach the
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
employee we're not going to staff them
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
we've spent thousands of dollars hiring
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
that person and we're not going to
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
provide that care again and again and
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
again and have people that we've spent a
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
lot of money for
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
leave that is going to increase costs
 
01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.910 align:start position:0%
leave that is going to increase costs
and

01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:48.070 --> 01:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
interesting and again after 47 years of
 
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
experience in this the facilities call
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
us when they've exhausted their
 
01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.030 align:start position:0%
us when they've exhausted their
opportunities

01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
internally and it may have been through
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
the the flu that went through the
 
01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
building and they need some prum staff
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
it may be I mean we co the state of New
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire provided a uh funding to
 
01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
Interim HealthCare particularly to go in
 
01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
and staff facilities that uh were on
 
01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
their literally on their knees because
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
their staff had had
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
dissipated and the patients they didn't
 
01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:27.400 align:start position:0%
want to close the
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
facility the Staffing shortages for
 
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
nurses is not going to be solved by
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
creating an environment of conflict and
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
and instead of a an environment of a
 
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort this is just first
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
class conflict and the patients are in
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
danger of not getting care when we're
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
called the facility has exhausted all of
 
01:26:54.390 --> 01:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
their alternatives
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
and and they've offered overtime to
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
their existing staff they've combed
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
their their uh people that have left and
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
call those emergencies occur and they're
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
hard to plan for and that's where the
 
01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
supplemental agency like ours comes into
 
01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:16.280 align:start position:0%
play we
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't the the sponsor of the
 
01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
bill I think might be a little bit
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
misinformed if we're sending somebody
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
into a to a
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
facility we we build a relationship I
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
mean we've been I've been doing this
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
since the ramir and the mccurley's
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
families these were family nursing homes
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
and we we establish a long-term
 
01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
relationship with our customers as any
 
01:27:45.629 --> 01:27:45.639 align:start position:0%
good business would do
 
01:27:45.639 --> 01:27:47.629 align:start position:0%
good business would do
and

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
we we provide that care because they
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
really need somebody and where they to
 
01:27:55.119 --> 01:27:56.030 align:start position:0%
really need somebody and where they to
provide

01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:27:59.550 --> 01:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
it the other thing about about agencies
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
is we contribute to the supply of
 
01:28:05.790 --> 01:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
nurses and when I say nurses I'm talking
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
about nurses and nurses AIDS which as
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
you probably know are in very short
 
01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
supply and the reason we contribute to
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
the supply is we give the alternative
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
some for people who want to work one day
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
a week or two days a week or three days
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
a week and their schedule varies they
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
can't take a full full-time job and so
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
the role of the supplemental nursing
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
service is really important to providing
 
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.270 align:start position:0%
service is really important to providing
that

01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
care people need some flexibility from
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
time to time in their schedule and a
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
supplemental agency provides that so
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's there's some real downside in
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
passing this bill for the facilities and
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure that they understand the
 
01:28:52.430 --> 01:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
steps that agencies like ours would take
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't we would never continue to
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
send nurses in to a facility that is
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
picking off our people one by one by one
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
and then finally I'll just say if
 
01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
somebody comes to us we don't own them
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
they can work anywhere they want but if
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
we've sent them to a facility we have a
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
13-week buyout and and uh they can work
 
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
if they're working two days a week and
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
they want to go to that facility and
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
they like it and they work for we figure
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
the hours out and it's a negotiated
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
settlement but we don't own anybody and
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
we can't control an employee from
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
working at another facility I mean
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's just doesn't work that way the
 
01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
it's that's a it just doesn't work um
 
01:29:41.709 --> 01:29:41.719 align:start position:0%
they can work where they want the only
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
restriction is where we've just placed
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
them so um and and truthfully most
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
facilities will work with an agency to
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
if they want to hire somebody
 
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
to make that happen and we're all for
 
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we're not against it um but it but
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
it needs to be something called
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
liquidated damages if we're just getting
 
01:30:07.390 --> 01:30:07.400 align:start position:0%
picked off one by one by one so I would
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
ask you to really take a hard look at
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
this bill and and urge you to uh on
 
01:30:17.109 --> 01:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
sections EF which specifically relate to
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
that component and there as I mentioned
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
there are other components of the bill
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
which are fine it's just good business
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's ethical business business and and
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way a business relationship
 
01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
should be so thank you very much and I'm
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions all right
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony represent K
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Peterson
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you just
 
01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned a 13 we buyout is that a a
 
01:30:44.870 --> 01:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
standard period that you use so that
 
01:30:47.189 --> 01:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
after the person has worked 13 weeks
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
there's an amount at which or they you
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
they've done enough to recover your cost
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and and actually that's that's
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated a bigger customer that we've
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
had a long-term relationship with that's
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
a that's a negotiated settlement we as I
 
01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
said we've been doing this for 47 years
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
and we pretty much have a nice
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with the customers for that
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
for that length of time so we we work
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
with people followup for followup thank
 
01:31:21.070 --> 01:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
you sir um so are most of your nurses
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
from within the New England area or from
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
further away there people that you
 
01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:26.639 align:start position:0%
recruit and and bring to New Hampshire
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're a local New Hampshire company we
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
have uh uh two offices in Maine but the
 
01:31:36.149 --> 01:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
nurses are are our neighbors pretty much
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and they it's folks that just
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
want to pick up some extra
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
time and we provide that we cover them
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
with workers comp we cover them with
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
malpractice and liability when the
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
facility goes to to uh bring them in
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
through US they've been fully vetted
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
with criminal background and and and uh
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
reference checking and skills testing
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
and so forth which I had mentioned
 
01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:01.189 align:start position:0%
and so forth which I had mentioned
previously

01:32:01.189 --> 01:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
res uh thank you um one of the things
 
01:32:07.629 --> 01:32:07.639 align:start position:0%
that I I heard in the earlier testimony
 
01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
on this bill that kind of struck me as
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
as it potentially something that uh
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
should be an issue and I want to ask
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
whether it would be an issue for your
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
business is the fact that the nurses
 
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't know about these bio Clauses and
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
non-compete clauses in the contract
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
between the agency and the healthcare
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
facility um would it affect your
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
business much if there was a disclosure
 
01:32:29.310 --> 01:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that the nurses that fill
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
the Staffing roles need to be told about
 
01:32:33.950 --> 01:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
any Clauses of that nature any
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them jumping ship that
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
are enforced from the facility side that
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
appears currently there's no way that
 
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:43.400 align:start position:0%
they necessarily would be told under
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
existing processes well we cover that in
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
orientation with each which prospective
 
01:32:52.709 --> 01:32:52.719 align:start position:0%
employee but if uh if there was some
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
signature require ired I mean I see that
 
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
as being acceptable it's not not trying
 
01:33:00.510 --> 01:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
to hide anything we we just really want
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
to avoid going to the expense of hiring
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
somebody I mean indeed I think runs
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
about $3,000 a month for us uh that's
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
just one Avenue we use a lot thank you
 
01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.030 align:start position:0%
just one Avenue we use a lot thank you
represent

01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:33:21.950 --> 01:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
Drago thank you Mr chair I'm curious do
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
you try to keep the same nurses going to
 
01:33:27.350 --> 01:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same clinic or do they go to all
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
different clinics when they work they
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
can but we try if they're happy there
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the facility is Happy there's I mean
 
01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
it just set it and forget it basically
 
01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's uh kind of a slanging way of
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
putting it I guess but if everybody's
 
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
happy there's no point in introducing
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
somebody new for followup sir so on
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
average how each one of your nurses how
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
many clinics would you say they they
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
work at or is it usually typically one
 
01:33:55.709 --> 01:33:55.719 align:start position:0%
or two just one or two pretty much I
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
mean it depends how long they've been
 
01:33:59.470 --> 01:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
with us some if they've been with us for
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
a long time they may work in a number of
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
facilities but we we try and limit it uh
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
because they're happy and the facility
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
is happy and they're comfortable in in
 
01:34:14.350 --> 01:34:14.360 align:start position:0%
their job and the job uh requirements at
 
01:34:17.470 --> 01:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
that particular facility one one more go
 
01:34:19.990 --> 01:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
ahead so if you if you just hear the
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
bill it sounds like once they work for
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
somebody like you they they can't work
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
anywhere but would you agree that
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it's just a few
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
places that they can't work but when we
 
01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
hire somebody they're not under under a
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
contract with just Interim HealthCare
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
they may work for two or three staffing
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
agencies and they're going to different
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
facilities and if they went to the same
 
01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.830 align:start position:0%
facilities and if they went to the same
facility

01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
through through
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
us but it was a different supplemental
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
agency that's the way it goes
 
01:34:56.669 --> 01:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:35:01.990 --> 01:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I got you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh so the it seems that you've had some
 
01:35:08.669 --> 01:35:08.679 align:start position:0%
success in recruiting
 
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
people that uh and I'm coming from the
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County delegation that we may
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
not have had uh the ability to recruit
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
the people that that so you're so you're
 
01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:22.760 align:start position:0%
doing something to staff these
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
facilities that have not not figured out
 
01:35:27.629 --> 01:35:27.639 align:start position:0%
at this point so what's the difference
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
that as a staffing agency and maybe it's
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
a little off track and if it is I'll do
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
this off offline but I I think it's
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
interesting that you're able to staff
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
these things we can't we have an
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
expression in the office is what you pay
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
attention to grows and we put our Focus
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
I mean we have recruiters and that's
 
01:35:50.550 --> 01:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
what they do is recruit and we we have
 
01:35:53.709 --> 01:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh artificial intelligence that that
 
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
places ads for us it's a prettyy
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
sophisticated process and and we put a
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
lot of energy and dollars into
 
01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:03.709 align:start position:0%
lot of energy and dollars into
that

01:36:03.709 --> 01:36:03.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh and just to clear something up we
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
don't we don't pay any health benefits
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
these are these are per DM staff they
 
01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:13.400 align:start position:0%
can work when they want to work they
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
tell us when they're
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
available so we we pay attention to the
 
01:36:21.669 --> 01:36:21.679 align:start position:0%
recruiting that's what we do we put a
 
01:36:24.950 --> 01:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
lot of effort into it uh as I said I
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
think we a lot of times we drop people
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
off the couch that because we just uh we
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
go back in in the uh nursing licenses
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
and send out notices there that we have
 
01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
work available we put a lot of effort
 
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:42.310 align:start position:0%
work available we put a lot of effort
into

01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
that and did you have a followup I I did
 
01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:49.639 align:start position:0%
please so you don't pay uh you don't pay
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
health care for the employees there's no
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
benefits necessarily that you pay
 
01:36:56.510 --> 01:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
vacation or any of that kind of stuff so
 
01:36:59.390 --> 01:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you and representative
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking our
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%
questions I I see a uh similarity
 
01:37:11.350 --> 01:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
between what you do and again I use the
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
word Head Hunter please accept my
 
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
apologies if it offends you but
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
basically you're finding bodies for jobs
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
that are open that an employer can't
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
find and my question of you is the
 
01:37:25.870 --> 01:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
buyout provision if I could use that
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
term that's common in your in your
 
01:37:29.830 --> 01:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
business is it not that if someone likes
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
the person we want them full time we
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
realize you've gone the effort of
 
01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
finding this person for us and we're
 
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
willing to pay and it's agreed between
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
the parties right exactly and and not
 
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.470 align:start position:0%
the parties right exactly and and not
not

01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
unlike Kelly girl or Manpower or one of
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
the staffing agencies for light
 
01:37:51.589 --> 01:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
industrial or clerical support staff
 
01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
we're we're the same follow what for
 
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
followup yes so so someone had made a
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
comment about how if we pass this bill
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
that we could save all sorts of money at
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
the county level but the reality is is
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
the county couldn't do what you do in
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
other words they haven't been able to
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
find the worker to fill the job some
 
01:38:13.550 --> 01:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
counties have I mean it it varies all
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
over what happens sometimes in a in a
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
facility is maybe they've hired somebody
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
that didn't didn't work out didn't work
 
01:38:24.189 --> 01:38:24.199 align:start position:0%
out but there were Direct of healthcare
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
services and they have a walk out well
 
01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
we get a call from that and it takes a
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
while for the facility to rebuild itself
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where that's where we step in
 
01:38:37.830 --> 01:38:37.840 align:start position:0%
and then when it's when they've staffed
 
01:38:39.629 --> 01:38:39.639 align:start position:0%
it and they we get a phone call and say
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
we're all set and that's that's it it's
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
a week to week deal mostly or even dayt
 
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
day followup Mr last one the last one um
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
your words yeah it is my words um so the
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
reality of the situation you go to all
 
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
this effort to find the staff you bring
 
01:38:57.390 --> 01:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
the staff in because they can't find
 
01:38:59.709 --> 01:38:59.719 align:start position:0%
them or it's it's a it's a a situation
 
01:39:02.589 --> 01:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
where it's needed right away okay and
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
you have a provision in the agreement
 
01:39:06.189 --> 01:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
with the party that you contract with
 
01:39:08.030 --> 01:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
that says if they want that person they
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
have to pay for it because you've done
 
01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
all this work ahead of time that they
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
either can't do or don't
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
Doh so basically this is interrupting
 
01:39:19.589 --> 01:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
your whole income stream if they do
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
decide to take business model yeah and
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
and I would say that
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
which I think I mentioned earlier when
 
01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
when we have longstanding customers and
 
01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
we have a business relationship
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely we we work out those times
 
01:39:36.270 --> 01:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
and we're not trying to step in
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's way our a nurse that works
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
for us we think about this if their if
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
their uh husband is a just use an
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
example a fireman and his schedule is
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
all over the place and she's a nurse and
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
they've got a couple of kids
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
if if something changes in their work
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
life um we're not standing in her way to
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
take a full-time job with benefits I
 
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
mean that would be that would really be
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
hurtful to our companies thank you R
 
01:40:10.709 --> 01:40:10.719 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair do you have
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
any idea the percentage of nurses that
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
are hired through agencies versus direct
 
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.189 align:start position:0%
are hired through agencies versus direct
I'm

01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not sure I understand the
 
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
question so some nurses are hired
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
through like an agency like your
 
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
organization and then some are hired
 
01:40:24.910 --> 01:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
directly by the hospital or healthcare
 
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
provider right oh we have a very small
 
01:40:29.310 --> 01:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of of of that I don't know I
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't put a number on it but but but
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
most nurses are direct then yes okay
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you yes represent
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
San I mean there are facilities that we
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
do not staff and haven't staffed in in
 
01:40:46.990 --> 01:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
years it's all their staff and others as
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
I mentioned earlier they may have a
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
outbreak of flu or they have a walk out
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
or somebody gets hurt and they call us
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
and say look we've got to we've got to
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
fill this we have patients that need
 
01:41:01.709 --> 01:41:01.719 align:start position:0%
their meds we have any number of
 
01:41:04.870 --> 01:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
things thank you sir U you've made it
 
01:41:07.990 --> 01:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
very clear that um you don't want to
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
stand in the way of people working where
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
they want to work
 
01:41:14.910 --> 01:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
um however you've made it very clear
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
that um if they want to work in the
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
facility that they're presently working
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
at through you it's going to cost the
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
facility something um can you go into
 
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
more detail as to Ju Just how much it's
 
01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
going to cost the I mean
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure for for my um Sullivan County
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home is you know what my
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
delegation supports and we are
 
01:41:41.109 --> 01:41:41.119 align:start position:0%
continually hearing that the U the cost
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
of agency nurses is killing them um and
 
01:41:48.350 --> 01:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
so um what would it cost Sullivan County
 
01:41:52.030 --> 01:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home to um buy out one of those
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh nurses that's provided by an agency
 
01:41:56.270 --> 01:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
the way we work it is let's say for
 
01:42:00.510 --> 01:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
example we're we're we are uh Staffing
 
01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
two days a week with a particular
 
01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
nurse and we would say the
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
suggested in most cases for the next 13
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
weeks they would continue their working
 
01:42:14.270 --> 01:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
two days a week and then they would be
 
01:42:17.310 --> 01:42:17.320 align:start position:0%
on their own and if they went to five
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
days a week we would only charge them
 
01:42:21.189 --> 01:42:21.199 align:start position:0%
the two days a week for the 13
 
01:42:24.030 --> 01:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
weeks follow up please just just trying
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
to be clear so essentially the um the
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
nursing home would continue to pay the
 
01:42:32.910 --> 01:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
agency two days a week at the agency um
 
01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
rate right the other three days there
 
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:39.080 align:start position:0%
would be um a uh Sullivan County Nursing
 
01:42:41.589 --> 01:42:41.599 align:start position:0%
Home employee and they could um but they
 
01:42:43.149 --> 01:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
could start getting benefits and that
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
type of thing and then we have a
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
situation where they'll say look we just
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
want to bring this person on what would
 
01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.750 align:start position:0%
want to bring this person on what would
it

01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
cost we don't want to go 13 weeks and
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
and uh I can't give you a number because
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes that happens with nurses AIDS
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes it happens with nurses uh
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
those are or LPNs RNs so there's
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
different different rates on on those
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
employees but we would we would work out
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
a negotiate a settlement which parties
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
would agree to we want to continue to
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
have a customer and we would Contin I
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
mean nurses move and leave the facility
 
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
ities and that we we'd like to have a
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
nice business relationship where they
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%

that person can leave Sullivan County
 
01:44:52.629 --> 01:44:52.639 align:start position:0%
and go work at Hillsboro County where's
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%

mean the nurse can can leave us and go
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
to any facility as long as it's not it's
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%

of time or a month period of time we
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
don't want our staff walking into a
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
facility and having a hoorde of of the
 
01:45:19.629 --> 01:45:19.639 align:start position:0%

come back sometimes that uh that's what
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
happened but if we if we were at
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County sending a nurse in and
 
01:45:36.310 --> 01:45:36.320 align:start position:0%

somebody represent thank you for follow
 
01:45:54.270 --> 01:45:54.280 align:start position:0%
no representative King
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I'm hearing a lot
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
of things about when an employee would
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
leave let's say somebody that comes to
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
you and wants employment and works
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
through your agency if that employee
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
were to voluntarily leave would they be
 
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
able to take a job for that not
 
01:46:10.990 --> 01:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
specifically that organization but an
 
01:46:12.750 --> 01:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
affiliate of that organization so like
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
let's say that organization owns several
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
facilities would they be able to work at
 
01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
a different facility yeah I wouldn't see
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
any issue with that okay it's where we
 
01:46:23.270 --> 01:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
staff the person that they they've
 
01:46:25.510 --> 01:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
called us the facility has called us
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
we've we' we've bent over Backwoods so
 
01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:31.560 align:start position:0%
to speak to to to put things in place to
 
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
send a qualified person that would that
 
01:46:36.310 --> 01:46:36.320 align:start position:0%
we skill match him to go into that
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
facility and we would uh obviously not
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
want them hired after day two on a
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
permanent basis if they didn't didn't
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
like it and they went somewhere else
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to them and that
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
happens it happens
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
frequently k Mr chair and thank you
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
again Mr Peterson it sounds like you
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
know as you said you're a local company
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
in business for a long time have
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
relationships with the you know with the
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the nurses and with the
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
institutions can you just give me an
 
01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:09.639 align:start position:0%
idea of how many other entities other
 
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:12.040 align:start position:0%
agencies are operating from out of state
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
that are probably using a different uh
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
method I I don't really know that I you
 
01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:19.550 align:start position:0%
method I I don't really know that I you
know

01:47:19.550 --> 01:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
we we have agencies that come in go and
 
01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh almost app an app app Staffing I
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
guess is is one but the facilities are a
 
01:47:39.550 --> 01:47:39.560 align:start position:0%
fairly significant risk doing that I
 
01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
mean somebody just signs up for an app
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
on an app and then goes to a facility
 
01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
and that's why you know I'm not opposed
 
01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
to all the aspects of a staffing bill um
 
01:47:52.589 --> 01:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to have somebody
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
that is trained knows what they're doing
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
has a a
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
license uh has been vetted the criminal
 
01:48:01.510 --> 01:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
background check which is a law it it
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
goes through the proper proper steps to
 
01:48:05.709 --> 01:48:05.719 align:start position:0%
make sure somebody has been vetted and
 
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
qualified to step in to care for people
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
in a home or a hospital or a nursing
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
home or a hospital or a school thanks
 
01:48:19.270 --> 01:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
stop I was gonna ask the same question
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
represent Clair thank you um so kudos to
 
01:48:30.149 --> 01:48:30.159 align:start position:0%
your company when you send people to
 
01:48:31.950 --> 01:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
someplace and they want to hire that
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
person obviously you've done a good job
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
and I it's well appreciated have you
 
01:48:37.229 --> 01:48:37.239 align:start position:0%
ever tried to recruit someone that's
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
already working somewhere
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
local we we would not go into a facility
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
and recruit their staff right and and
 
01:48:49.350 --> 01:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
again if you're looking to build a
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
business relationship that would end
 
01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
that relationship and a heartbeat I mean
 
01:48:57.790 --> 01:48:57.800 align:start position:0%
if we put an ad in the paper or look up
 
01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.550 align:start position:0%
if we put an ad in the paper or look up
on

01:48:58.550 --> 01:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
indeed uh and they come to you and they
 
01:49:03.589 --> 01:49:03.599 align:start position:0%

committee my name is Patricia angland

I'm a school nurse in Manchester and the
 
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
union representative for the Manchester
 
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
School nurses I previously worked for a
 
01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
Nur nursing agency for seven years
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
before finding a way out I witnessed
 
01:49:45.629 --> 01:49:45.639 align:start position:0%
daily what these n what these
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
non-competes and bio Clauses due to
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
nurses organizations and taxpayers I'm
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of Bill 386
 
01:49:54.669 --> 01:49:54.679 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually the one that wrote the
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
wording for it and representative priest
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to submit it for me um
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
as he stated RSA 27570 requires
 
01:50:04.430 --> 01:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
employers to notify employees of a
 
01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
non-compete um in their contract as a
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
condition of employment prior to hiring
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
and submitting a copy to them prior to
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
hiring and then RSA 326b 45a voids
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
restrictions on nurses based on
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
geographic location many agencies are
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
subverting these laws by placing the
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
non-competes between the agencies and
 
01:50:28.159 --> 01:50:29.709 align:start position:0%
non-competes between the agencies and
the

01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
organizations unfortunately it's taking
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
advantage of the nurses the healthare
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
system and the taxpayers I've been able
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
to confirm that the following agencies
 
01:50:38.709 --> 01:50:38.719 align:start position:0%
have utilized this practice within the
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
past year Max them bed could you get a
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
little bit closer to Mike so we can hear
 
01:50:45.069 --> 01:50:45.079 align:start position:0%
you back here thank you I've been able
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
to confirm that the following agencies
 
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
have utilized this practice within the
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
past year Maxum based out of Columbia
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
Maryland Procare based out of Denver
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
Colorado acor based out of piscatqua New
 
01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
Jersey Bright Star based out of gurnie
 
01:51:00.069 --> 01:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
Illinois Regency Home Health based out
 
01:51:02.350 --> 01:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
of lonary New Hampshire Norton based out
 
01:51:04.069 --> 01:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
of Cohasset Massachusetts and career
 
01:51:07.069 --> 01:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
staff based out of Irving Texas um which
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
actually goes a step further and bans
 
01:51:09.870 --> 01:51:09.880 align:start position:0%
the hiring of Staff even if they switch
 
01:51:13.109 --> 01:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
to another agency most of these unlike
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Peterson's agency are one to twoe not
 
01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:16.950 align:start position:0%
Mr Peterson's agency are one to twoe not

13
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
week New Hampshire's already
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
experiencing a nursing shortage
 
01:51:21.629 --> 01:51:21.639 align:start position:0%
resulting in high competition and
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
increased labor costs nursing agencies
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
utiliz non-competes are taking advantage
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the shortage by preventing nurses
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
from freely moving to areas of need and
 
01:51:31.910 --> 01:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
charging premium rates increasing
 
01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:33.470 align:start position:0%
charging premium rates increasing
organizational

01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
organizational
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
expenditures agency nurses are often
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
assigned to multiple organizations when
 
01:51:39.189 --> 01:51:39.199 align:start position:0%
I was an agency nurse I did have a
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
couple regular organizations that I went
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
to however if there was a call out here
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
a call out there it was not unheard of
 
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
for me to be sent to many Al
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
organizations for a single day then
 
01:51:52.109 --> 01:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
preventing me from working for those
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
places for one to two years without a
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
buyout it creates a network of
 
01:51:58.910 --> 01:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
organizations where nurses cannot work
 
01:52:00.950 --> 01:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
and trapping them for nurse to be able
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
to leave that agency and work at an
 
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
organization where they were previously
 
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
assigned that organization required to
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
provide compensation to the to the
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
agency essentially buying them according
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire Hospital
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
Association Hospital costs related to
 
01:52:18.189 --> 01:52:18.199 align:start position:0%
contracted labor increased from 118.5
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
million in 2019 to 302.7 million in 202
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
22 with
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
133.5 increase from 2021 to 2022 alone
 
01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
lastly hospitals are not the only
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
organizations requiring nursing staff
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and Facilities such as
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Centers
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities and public
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
schools funded by taxpayer dollars are
 
01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
also required nursing staff any costs
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
associated with nursing agency
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
non-competes are passed directly to the
 
01:52:48.069 --> 01:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
taxpayers through local taxes or
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Medicaid to put this in
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
perspective in Manchester School
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
District District we have 19 direct
 
01:52:59.030 --> 01:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
hires we have 44
 
01:53:01.069 --> 01:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
contracted for the Manchester School
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
District to buy out just half of those
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
is between $100,000 and $400,000 of
 
01:53:08.310 --> 01:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money in conclusion I want to
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear I'm not against nursing
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
agencies they fill a need in the
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
healthcare Market I am against agencies
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this need by
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
charging organizations exorbitant
 
01:53:19.229 --> 01:53:19.239 align:start position:0%
amounts for their services and requiring
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
additional compensation for nurses to
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
leave the agency to work for those same
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
organizations if they choose this
 
01:53:26.589 --> 01:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
control over nurses utilizing human
 
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
beings as a commodity to be purchased
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
for an agency's Financial benefit
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
directly opposes our free market
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
economic system there's no reason
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
agencies cannot utilize mechanisms
 
01:53:38.189 --> 01:53:38.199 align:start position:0%
similar to other businesses such as
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
incentives and benefits to keep staff
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
rather than entrapping them to be
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
purchased as he was stating about
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
advertising he stated that he puts a lot
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
of money into advertising AI recruitment
 
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
staff all that that's just money that
 
01:53:58.750 --> 01:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
public schools Corrections they don't
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
have that money so they're trying to
 
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
compete recruiting with an agency that
 
01:54:06.350 --> 01:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
puts thousands of dollars into
 
01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
advertising you go on indeed looking at
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
school nurse in Manchester Regency is
 
01:54:12.310 --> 01:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
the first one that pops up because they
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
pay to be at the
 
01:54:16.189 --> 01:54:16.199 align:start position:0%
top thank
 
01:54:18.589 --> 01:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony and can
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
you provide that
 
01:54:23.069 --> 01:54:23.079 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to us yeah absolutely

please thank you and representative
 
01:54:28.229 --> 01:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
proud thank you Mr chairman um so I
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
think we've already um kind of
 
01:54:32.550 --> 01:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
identified that the hiding the clause in
 
01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:34.360 align:start position:0%
the contract that the the employee
 
01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:37.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't see uh is a problem do you see
 
01:54:39.669 --> 01:54:39.679 align:start position:0%
that happening uh in the contracts that
 
01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh you see in Manchester School District
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes we've actually had multiple nurses
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
who were agency who wanted to come over
 
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
because they wanted the stability of
 
01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
even though we have lower pay they
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
wanted that stability of knowing that
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
were going to have work compared to
 
01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:56.560 align:start position:0%
agency and there was no non-compete and
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
they kept searching there's like there's
 
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
no non-compete in my contract um many of
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
them were out of state agencies that
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
they were employed with however there
 
01:55:07.030 --> 01:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
was that non-compete between the
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
organization and the agency and they had
 
01:55:11.950 --> 01:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
no knowledge of that followup for
 
01:55:14.709 --> 01:55:14.719 align:start position:0%
followup um do you have any insight into
 
01:55:16.589 --> 01:55:16.599 align:start position:0%
why U Manchester School dist or any
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
other organization is accepting these
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
contracts I mean in instead of just
 
01:55:21.390 --> 01:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
phoning up the agency of the previous
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
speaker that has more reason more 13we
 
01:55:25.149 --> 01:55:25.159 align:start position:0%
terms or something um is it is it just
 
01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
bad negotiating is it that they're
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
desperate and nobody else is filling the
 
01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
position wh why why is this being signed
 
01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
in the first place if it's turned into
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
such a problem hourly cost um so it goes
 
01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
out for RFP and they look at the hourly
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
cost and what it's going to cost to fill
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
those positions if they can't direct
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
higher um and so obviously being a
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
public school tends to go to the lowest
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
cost to save the taxpayers money thank
 
01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming in to testify my
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
mother was a
 
01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:00.069 align:start position:0%
mother was a
nurse

01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
nurse
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
um I was reading the bill and it talks
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
specifically about the uh Health Care
 
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
Facility and the agency and so forth but
 
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if and I can't remember the
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
gentleman's name rck Rick Rick had an
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
agreement with Manchester School
 
01:56:19.310 --> 01:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
District that Manchester School District
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
put in the language that if they wanted
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
to buy you out say you were the nurse in
 
01:56:27.069 --> 01:56:27.079 align:start position:0%
question that they decided how much they
 
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
were going to pay in other words it
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't from Rick it was from the
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
ultimate contractor the the the school
 
01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
district it wouldn't be in this bill the
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
law wouldn't apply because the way the
 
01:56:41.709 --> 01:56:41.719 align:start position:0%
scenario worked out it doesn't match
 
01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
what this was trying to do do you follow
 
01:56:45.109 --> 01:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I do I can't imagine an
 
01:56:48.270 --> 01:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
organization would sit there and say I'm
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
going to pay x amount of dollars if they
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to follow for followup sir um
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
no what I'm saying is if if Rick was
 
01:56:59.229 --> 01:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
providing 44 nurses to the Manchester
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
school and I hope you are um then the
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
school district would have a little bit
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
of authority in that negotiation in
 
01:57:08.669 --> 01:57:08.679 align:start position:0%
other words he'd say okay if some of
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
these people work out we're going to pay
 
01:57:13.069 --> 01:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
a flat $5,000 or something like that to
 
01:57:15.149 --> 01:57:15.159 align:start position:0%
get them on our staff so this is where
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
the free market comes in agencies
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
traditionally pay significantly more
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
than the public sector so it becomes um
 
01:57:26.109 --> 01:57:26.119 align:start position:0%
um a positive negative imbalance an
 
01:57:27.470 --> 01:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
imbalance not an imbalance it's a
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
positive negative that each nurse would
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
have to weigh like do I want the higher
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
pay or do I want the stability and we
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
kind of see it go both ways um there's
 
01:57:36.830 --> 01:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
many nurses that want to stay with the
 
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
agency they want that higher hourly wage
 
01:57:40.669 --> 01:57:40.679 align:start position:0%
and they wouldn't leave the agency but
 
01:57:41.950 --> 01:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
there are nurses that want that
 
01:57:45.149 --> 01:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
stability sure and but they can't leave
 
01:57:47.910 --> 01:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
they couldn't find the job well it's not
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't find a job it's that
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
they can't come to the district once
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
they've done a shift without the
 
01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:56.589 align:start position:0%
they've done a shift without the
district

01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:57:56.599 --> 01:58:00.550 align:start position:0%
district
paying

01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
solvin thank
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
you got to get in position here um the
 
01:58:09.510 --> 01:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
um do you have an idea how much it would
 
01:58:11.229 --> 01:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
cost the Manchester School District to
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
buy out one of these nurses so it
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
depends on the contract um so last year
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
they had nine to 10 different agencies
 
01:58:21.669 --> 01:58:21.679 align:start position:0%
just because not even a single agency
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
can St our school district so we had N9
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
to 10 different agencies and each
 
01:58:27.750 --> 01:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
contract was different there were one or
 
01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
two that did not have buyouts and
 
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
non-competes in there so I'm not going
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
to say that all nursing agencies do this
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
it's not the case um the ones that are
 
01:58:38.589 --> 01:58:38.599 align:start position:0%
actually like interum the ones that are
 
01:58:40.589 --> 01:58:40.599 align:start position:0%
more local to the state do not tend to
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
have this practice it's the outof state
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
ones that tend to do this they're also
 
01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that don't tend to vet the
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
nurses so this is where it really
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
becomes a problem
 
01:58:52.589 --> 01:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
it can go anywhere from $5,000 to
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
$20,000 per nurse depending on their
 
01:59:02.270 --> 01:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
their LNA LPN RN their degree their
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
experience um that's why such a range
 
01:59:09.510 --> 01:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
for even just 20 to 22 to come over as a
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
direct hire it's between 100 and
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
$400,000 thank you all right
 
01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
representative lir did you have a
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:59:26.350 --> 01:59:26.360 align:start position:0%
for coming today so one of the things um
 
01:59:28.390 --> 01:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned is the cities and
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
towns inability to compete because of
 
01:59:34.589 --> 01:59:34.599 align:start position:0%
the cost of advertising and recruiting
 
01:59:34.599 --> 01:59:35.830 align:start position:0%
the cost of advertising and recruiting
recruiting

01:59:35.830 --> 01:59:35.840 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
workers why do you think that
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
is have you looked at school district
 
01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
budgets but we're paying for it one way
 
01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
or the other right we're paying for it
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
one way or the other it's a matter of
 
01:59:49.709 --> 01:59:49.719 align:start position:0%
what people want to put into the school
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
district budget for advertising and and
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
direct hiring versus what we end up
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
having to pay on the back end and
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
basically asking forgiveness because we
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
need these
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
positions versus hey can we get this so
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
we can staff these positions and
 
02:00:06.589 --> 02:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
advertise to get them a lot of people
 
02:00:08.109 --> 02:00:08.119 align:start position:0%
don't want to approve the money upfront
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
so then we're having to pay it on the
 
02:00:13.629 --> 02:00:13.639 align:start position:0%
back end okay and represent flan again
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
no no I'm all set representative Granger
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so you mentioned
 
02:00:22.030 --> 02:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
these two plus year non-competes is that
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
only between the agency and their
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
customers or does it apply to the nurse
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
if she's going for work elsewhere so
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
they can go elsewhere but if they like
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
that facility they can't work there for
 
02:00:34.589 --> 02:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
that amount of time without the
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
organization paying okay so just to be
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
CLE like if so if you didn't want to
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
work at the school and you wanted to get
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
a nursing job somewhere else that would
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
be okay as long as you didn't work a
 
02:00:47.669 --> 02:00:47.679 align:start position:0%
single shift there okay thank you I I
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
would like to add it was not uncommon
 
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:51.560 align:start position:0%
when I was an agency nurse to be sent to
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
multiple locations for a single shift
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
preventing me from then doing
 
02:01:00.430 --> 02:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
that represent stop um thank you U thank
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
you for coming and thank you for taking
 
02:01:05.350 --> 02:01:05.360 align:start position:0%
the our questions um can you answer for
 
02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:09.079 align:start position:0%
me what motivates someone who is a nurse
 
02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:11.719 align:start position:0%
um to use a staffing agency rather than
 
02:01:15.310 --> 02:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
just looking for a job flexibility money
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
there's many benefits to an agency I'm
 
02:01:20.270 --> 02:01:20.280 align:start position:0%
not against agencies whatsoever um you
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say I want to work
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
work this day this day this day but not
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
this day this day this day if you have
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
somebody who has great benefits but
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of money hey I can do
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
an agency job I can bring down great pay
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
and I can take this week off when I want
 
02:01:38.750 --> 02:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
this week off when I want I'm not
 
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
relegated to work these holidays it's
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
great flexibility it's great pay and
 
02:01:45.149 --> 02:01:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's where a lot of nurses are
 
02:01:48.069 --> 02:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
attracted it's when nurses want
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
stability that they're willing to take
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
the lower paying jobs where we have a
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
lot of our short ages and so these
 
02:01:54.990 --> 02:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
agencies even though they have these
 
02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
great things and can already attract are
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
then trapping those nurses that are
 
02:02:01.430 --> 02:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
willing to do these other jobs that
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
less R McKenzie question thank you Mr
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
chair uh you may not be able to answer
 
02:02:16.589 --> 02:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
this but uh do you have any sense of of
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
the wage that a nurse gets under the
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
agency environment
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the wage plus benefit cost um that
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
somebody would get uh be entitled to in
 
02:02:32.550 --> 02:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
a uh in the city of Manchester for
 
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
instance that we get healthare and
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
pension benefits and all that stuff is
 
02:02:38.669 --> 02:02:38.679 align:start position:0%
that if you if you put all that stuff
 
02:02:41.189 --> 02:02:41.199 align:start position:0%
together and you add 30 or 40 maybe more
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
percent uh to a person's salary is it
 
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
comparable no so it's about um depending
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the position it can be anywhere from
 
02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
like 10,000 to3 to
 
02:02:56.669 --> 02:02:56.679 align:start position:0%
$40,000 annually difference and that's
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you take like in the school district
 
02:03:00.629 --> 02:03:00.639 align:start position:0%
if you take the annual salary plus the
 
02:03:03.350 --> 02:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
benefits um because our benefits run
 
02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:05.709 align:start position:0%
benefits um because our benefits run
about

02:03:05.709 --> 02:03:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.550 --> 02:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
52.3% um if you take that in comparison
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
to the hourly salary of an agency nurse
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
um the agency nurse still makes quite a
 
02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.550 align:start position:0%
um the agency nurse still makes quite a
bit

02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
bit
 
02:03:18.910 --> 02:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
more so there is quite a benefit to
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
working for an agency there it's not
 
02:03:22.270 --> 02:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
like they're going to be like completely
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
out of business there's not going to be
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
this Mass Exodus from agencies represent
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
proud thank you Mr chairman um do you
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
have any insight into why there's such
 
02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
variation in the buyout terms amongst
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
the various agencies that Manchester
 
02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
School District works with u mean
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't the school district put a
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
boilerplate or maximum buyout
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirements into the RFP and say you're
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
not even allowed to bid unless you meet
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
these requirements I mean would that
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
cause other problems like they wouldn't
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
actually be able to fill the positions
 
02:03:53.149 --> 02:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
or I mean I I that's why I'm trying to
 
02:03:54.790 --> 02:03:54.800 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around is is why isn't this
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
just solved at the RFP stage so I can't
 
02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
speak to the RFP stage or the attorney
 
02:04:02.669 --> 02:04:02.679 align:start position:0%
that did the contracts I do know that a
 
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
lot of times when we put out the RFP
 
02:04:07.709 --> 02:04:07.719 align:start position:0%
there's only one two or three that they
 
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
accept however because of our size we're
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
the largest District in the in the state
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
um we end up having to go then to
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
multiple as like a last Stitch just to
 
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
get people in and these agencies they
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
each have their own
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
requirements so I can't speak to the
 
02:04:26.310 --> 02:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
negotiation of that because I'm not part
 
02:04:29.990 --> 02:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
of that thank you representative Ling
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for taking my
 
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
question uh when you worked for an
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
agency nurse um were you aware of how
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
these agencies generated Revenue did you
 
02:04:39.709 --> 02:04:39.719 align:start position:0%
know how they made
 
02:04:43.750 --> 02:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
money no not at the time okay thank you
 
02:04:48.350 --> 02:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
represent stop um thank you um I um I
 
02:04:50.549 --> 02:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if you would you
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
know because you are a school nurse um I
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it if uh could you give
 
02:05:00.430 --> 02:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
us um an idea of um what School nurses
 
02:05:02.470 --> 02:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
do you're not just putting Band-Aids on
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
kids um and and IEP requirements and um
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
potential for litigation when nursing is
 
02:05:14.830 --> 02:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
not staffed in schools thank you yeah so
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
nurses are actually not required in the
 
02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire however um we do
 
02:05:21.069 --> 02:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
like you said a lot more than Band-Aids
 
02:05:22.270 --> 02:05:22.280 align:start position:0%
on booboos
 
02:05:24.669 --> 02:05:24.679 align:start position:0%
we do tube feeds we do suctioning we
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
obviously do meds we do triage uh
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
seizure kids a lot of times we do drugs
 
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol fights
 
02:05:35.109 --> 02:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
um catastrophic injuries we see
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
especially at the high school level um
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
we run the gamut we obviously students
 
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
have IEPs a lot of those students have
 
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
individual nurses with them who do tube
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
feeds suctioning or with the students
 
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
all day long that's why we have such aot
 
02:05:50.750 --> 02:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're basically a mini Hospital in the
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
um significant amount of care that our
 
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:57.549 align:start position:0%
um significant amount of care that our
students

02:05:57.549 --> 02:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:05:59.950 --> 02:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
need all right see you no further
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
questions U represent
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
C so you mentioned in your Mr chair
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you mentioned in your
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that there are other agencies
 
02:06:09.830 --> 02:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
that don't require this in New Hampshire
 
02:06:11.709 --> 02:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
the ones that are here in the state so
 
02:06:13.990 --> 02:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
clarify if I'm wrong but it sounds like
 
02:06:16.709 --> 02:06:16.719 align:start position:0%
uh there are other vendors let's say
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
that do not do what is this bill would
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
correct let's say is that correct that's
 
02:06:23.189 --> 02:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
correct every agency does their own
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
thing so there are a handful that do not
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
do this and to them I find that very
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
commendable I think that's the right way
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
to do things how unfortunately that is
 
02:06:34.510 --> 02:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
not how everybody does things and I'm
 
02:06:36.950 --> 02:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
finding the majority of the ones that
 
02:06:40.750 --> 02:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
are that unkind um are from out of state
 
02:06:43.109 --> 02:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
and actually um somebody asked about
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
agencies trying to recruit nurses who
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
are currently working I routinely get
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
messages and phone calls from an agency
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
while I'm working
 
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
FYI for followup so just to ask the
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
question would you support the
 
02:06:59.350 --> 02:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District utilizing
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
only those new hampshire-based
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
organizations to find a better situation
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
to not have to pass this bill to fix the
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
issue itself if they had the budget
 
02:07:10.229 --> 02:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
allotment to do
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you
 
02:07:18.669 --> 02:07:18.679 align:start position:0%
okay yes ma'am go ahead thank you um one
 
02:07:20.990 --> 02:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
last question are you aware of any other
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
states that have similar legislation
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
that is aimed at um ending these
 
02:07:29.149 --> 02:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
non-competes for nurses staff nurses
 
02:07:31.390 --> 02:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
yeah actually the language in this um
 
02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill is modeled after Illinois and Iowa
 
02:07:38.750 --> 02:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
who enacted the legislation in 22 and
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
23 represent kale chair and thank you
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh can you tell
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
us if that legislation in those States
 
02:07:50.669 --> 02:07:50.679 align:start position:0%
has improved the situation with Staffing
 
02:07:53.350 --> 02:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know
 
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
follow up yes sir okay before this is my
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
question I had before you told me about
 
02:08:02.470 --> 02:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
the other states um so the out of state
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh nurses are most of them are probably
 
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming here for a short term to make
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
higher wages and then go home and would
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
let would be not so in inclined to
 
02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
settle down in New Hampshire uh for
 
02:08:18.069 --> 02:08:18.079 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and but so the the
 
02:08:20.470 --> 02:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
hiring challenge I think is that because
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
we're not training enough nurses here in
 
02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so the nurses themselves
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
are not based out of state the agencies
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
are based out of state they're
 
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
recruiting New Hampshire nurses by
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
advertising and paying the money to
 
02:08:35.149 --> 02:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
advertise and get ahead of the public
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
entities like the correctional system
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the school districts and stuff like
 
02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
that to basically head hunt and get them
 
02:08:43.549 --> 02:08:43.559 align:start position:0%
for the higher cost to make their money
 
02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
and so that we don't get them and many
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
of the agency nurses I spoke with
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
thought that they were applying for the
 
02:08:51.750 --> 02:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
district and that the agency was acting
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the district and they felt
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
quite deceived after the fact learning
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
that they weren't actually working for
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
the district I see thank you all right
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am for your testimony I
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:17.310 --> 02:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chairman and members
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
of the committee I hope I'm not the last
 
02:09:21.149 --> 02:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
speaker before lunch but if I am I'll
 
02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
try try and be brief thank you sir I am
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
here um this a this afternoon on behalf
 
02:09:30.629 --> 02:09:30.639 align:start position:0%
of the American Staffing Association and
 
02:09:33.069 --> 02:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
we are concerned about housebuilt
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
386 um and you heard some uh very good
 
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
testimony by Rick Peterson and for many
 
02:09:42.910 --> 02:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the same reasons um we are concerned
 
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
about those sections on page
 
02:09:49.629 --> 02:09:49.639 align:start position:0%
two uh lines three through well
 
02:09:52.149 --> 02:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
certainly nine and and and then there
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
there's the exceptions that uh 1 through
 
02:09:59.870 --> 02:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
a through C uh permit
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
um but we're we're dealing with contract
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
law um and the contracts between the
 
02:10:08.790 --> 02:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
facilities and the
 
02:10:12.189 --> 02:10:12.199 align:start position:0%
agencies and um this would be certainly
 
02:10:15.109 --> 02:10:15.119 align:start position:0%
an intrusion an invasion of that private
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
contract between those uh
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether uh disclosure is
 
02:10:28.510 --> 02:10:28.520 align:start position:0%
the is the right step it might be uh for
 
02:10:32.589 --> 02:10:32.599 align:start position:0%
purposes of informing the employee in
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
this situation um that might be the
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
redress up front rather than having no
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
redress on the back end when a facility
 
02:10:46.589 --> 02:10:46.599 align:start position:0%
can just cancel a a a contract without
 
02:10:49.229 --> 02:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
any consequence and that's really what
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
is at stake here contract law and being
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
able to uphold
 
02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.470 align:start position:0%
able to uphold
that

02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
um I won't go into all of the the you
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
know experiences and details that that
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Peterson went into I thought they
 
02:11:09.149 --> 02:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
were uh ex very well
 
02:11:11.910 --> 02:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
explained um
 
02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
by putting in the language on the page
 
02:11:18.629 --> 02:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
two lines 3 through n you're taking
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility out of the relationship and
 
02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
I think we heard Mr Peterson talk about
 
02:11:25.629 --> 02:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
that flexibility and the importance of
 
02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
that relationship and being able to
 
02:11:28.679 --> 02:11:30.189 align:start position:0%
that relationship and being able to
to

02:11:30.189 --> 02:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
deliver in this case nurses for
 
02:11:33.119 --> 02:11:35.109 align:start position:0%
deliver in this case nurses for
different

02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
facilities um I think
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
too this issue is
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
diminishing it obviously spiked during
 
02:11:50.430 --> 02:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
Co it was a very dire situation in in
 
02:11:51.750 --> 02:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
many instances
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
around the country not just New
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and what we are seeing and I
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
can provide to the committee um later
 
02:12:06.669 --> 02:12:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.270 --> 02:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
self-correcting the the demand is not as
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
high the the um profits are not as high
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh for for agencies and so um we're
 
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
seeing a return to a normal time
 
02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.310 align:start position:0%
seeing a return to a normal time
time

02:12:24.310 --> 02:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
um with that Mr chairman um I think I
 
02:12:30.629 --> 02:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
would conclude my
 
02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
remarks I ask the committee to consider
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
that fairness in the contractual
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
relationships between two
 
02:12:42.990 --> 02:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
entities it is uh you know two years ago
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
this committee was involved in Senate
 
02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:45.870 align:start position:0%
this committee was involved in Senate
Bill

02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:12:48.990 --> 02:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
149 that passed into law and brought
 
02:12:52.589 --> 02:12:52.599 align:start position:0%
about a new registration process for any
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh staffing agency that wanted to
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
operate in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
and that was a good
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
step and it put restrictions on staffing
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
agencies it didn't put restrictions on
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
the facilities but it put restrictions
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
on on the staffing agencies and so there
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
is accountability out there and you know
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
we we need to see if this is going to
 
02:13:19.709 --> 02:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
work the current law as well as the
 
02:13:23.069 --> 02:13:23.079 align:start position:0%
postco era that we're we're now in I'd
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
be happy to try and address any
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions and if I'm unable to I will
 
02:13:29.549 --> 02:13:29.559 align:start position:0%
endeavor to find you answers all right
 
02:13:30.950 --> 02:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your testimony do we
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
have any questions represent
 
02:13:36.629 --> 02:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
suvan I I guess I'm a little bit
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
troubled in that
 
02:13:42.910 --> 02:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
um I can um I can see the point of the
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
agency um not wanting to um lose an
 
02:13:51.510 --> 02:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
employee first day after the the nurses
 
02:13:54.750 --> 02:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
assigned to a facility
 
02:13:59.310 --> 02:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
um and I'm persuaded by uh Mr Peterson's
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
um good business sense that if you don't
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
treat your clients well they're not
 
02:14:09.830 --> 02:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
clients anymore um I'm also persuaded
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
that um there's some abuse out there um
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
that U some of these agencies are taking
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
advantage um are um being grossly
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
unreasonable and probably don't care
 
02:14:23.790 --> 02:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
about that business
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
relationship um and I'm trying to figure
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
out how to fix what's
 
02:14:29.199 --> 02:14:31.270 align:start position:0%
out how to fix what's
broke

02:14:31.270 --> 02:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
broke
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
without um destroying what's
 
02:14:36.310 --> 02:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
working um
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
thoughts I I I think they're you know
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm not the expert in the Staffing
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
World representative Sullivan but I'm
 
02:14:45.390 --> 02:14:45.400 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly willing to take that very
 
02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
good question back to uh my client you
 
02:14:51.629 --> 02:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
know I it's almost seems like this
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
language in
 
02:14:56.910 --> 02:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
386 is a sledgehammer being used on an
 
02:15:00.589 --> 02:15:00.599 align:start position:0%
issue that perhaps only needs
 
02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
um scalpel I don't know um maybe not a
 
02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.189 align:start position:0%
um scalpel I don't know um maybe not a
good

02:15:06.189 --> 02:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
um com com comparison but I you know I I
 
02:15:13.390 --> 02:15:13.400 align:start position:0%
think perhaps if if something needs to
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
be done I think this can be worked on
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
and and developed without just putting
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
the sledgehammer onto the uh
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
relationship all right follow up uh
 
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
please for follow up I I I intend to
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
also call our um nursing home
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
administrator who um has suffered under
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
the weight of the agency nurses um but
 
02:15:38.030 --> 02:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sure he's grateful that the agencies
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
are there to provide the nurses
 
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise he wouldn't be able to staff
 
02:15:43.629 --> 02:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
the nursing home he'd have to throw
 
02:15:48.629 --> 02:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
people out right residents out um so um
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
would like to get his thoughts I'd like
 
02:15:52.790 --> 02:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
but bottom line is there it appears to
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
me something needs to be
 
02:15:59.109 --> 02:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
fixed and I think we need uh some help
 
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
figuring out how to fix what's the it
 
02:16:04.549 --> 02:16:04.559 align:start position:0%
sounds like these out ofate agencies are
 
02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
02:16:09.350 --> 02:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like the New Hampshire
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
agencies perhaps are not so much it
 
02:16:14.229 --> 02:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
would be oh I'm sorry I didn't mean go
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
ahead goad it would be interesting to
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
learn and and perhaps we can from the
 
02:16:20.310 --> 02:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure and
 
02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:22.109 align:start position:0%
office of professional lure and
certification

02:16:22.109 --> 02:16:22.119 align:start position:0%
certification
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
whether some of the agencies that the
 
02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker uh listed off are
 
02:16:30.149 --> 02:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
have registered as as they're required
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
to under the new New Hampshire law I I
 
02:16:37.349 --> 02:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
see it for followup sir yes I see a head
 
02:16:39.270 --> 02:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
nodding is that meaning that they are
 
02:16:43.389 --> 02:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:46.190 --> 02:16:46.200 align:start position:0%
you represent Flanigan thank you uh Mr
 
02:16:51.150 --> 02:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
chair good to see you Mr berky um
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
I see first of all I don't see this bill
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
solving the problem that they're trying
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
to solve and let me throw some things at
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
you and see what your
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
responses um there's a notification
 
02:17:04.990 --> 02:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
issue I think the employees need the
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
nurses need because they're not Mr
 
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
Peterson's employees they're contractors
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
with them so there needs to be some
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
notification up front with the nurse or
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
nurses that says that if they do decide
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
to stay there or if there's some
 
02:17:20.399 --> 02:17:21.549 align:start position:0%
to stay there or if there's some
discussion

02:17:21.549 --> 02:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:17:24.469 --> 02:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
that there's a relationship that Mr and
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just using as an example Mr P
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
Peterson uh and the facility have that
 
02:17:32.270 --> 02:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
there's some negotiation so it's not
 
02:17:34.270 --> 02:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
really non-compete it's really
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
notification that is there is there a
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
question at the end of this yeah I'm
 
02:17:39.349 --> 02:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
getting there I'm getting there because
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
and now look at that now you I'm having
 
02:17:44.910 --> 02:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
a brain fart um the uh the other thing
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
is that um oh God what did you do that
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
for never mind
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
there and I'll
 
02:17:55.270 --> 02:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
ask would you like to ask a question
 
02:17:58.549 --> 02:17:58.559 align:start position:0%
while I I would respond to that by just
 
02:18:00.549 --> 02:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
saying that you know I I I think perhaps
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
there are some issues that can be worked
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
on and and along with what
 
02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan was was aiming
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
towards um so I think between you know
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
if if there's going to be a subcommittee
 
02:18:13.709 --> 02:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
or the full committee we would be more
 
02:18:15.750 --> 02:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
than welcome to work with this group to
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
see if there's a a solution out there
 
02:18:19.830 --> 02:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative pro thank
 
02:18:22.110 --> 02:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um if we were to add a
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
requirement that all government rfps uh
 
02:18:26.990 --> 02:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
need to specify uniform maximum buyout
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
for all the biders all the agencies that
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
want to do business under that RFP do
 
02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
you think that would be their affect
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to get RFP responses and
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
actually fill the positions or do you
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
think that would just level the playing
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
field and maybe fix I think the problem
 
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
that Manchester had which is they didn't
 
02:18:43.309 --> 02:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
think about this in
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
advance I I I think it would bring some
 
02:18:48.469 --> 02:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
light to the issue without a doubt and
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
and whether it would be a a fix
 
02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:53.599 align:start position:0%
probably not 100% but it would be a step
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
in the right
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
direction thank you represent Flanigan
 
02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
for a followup no it's okay I I got I
 
02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
got a a procedural issue with you after
 
02:19:06.629 --> 02:19:06.639 align:start position:0%
this bill this is done all right thank
 
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
you I look forward to
 
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
that okay sir thank you for your
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
question thank
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%

call Paul Dingle
 
02:19:23.230 --> 02:19:23.240 align:start position:0%

Dingle I'm sorry ma'am absolutely if you
 
02:19:28.830 --> 02:19:28.840 align:start position:0%

affiliation with uh my name is Pam
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
denapoli and I'm with the uh New
 
02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:34.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school Nurses Association New
 
02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Nurses Association um I only
 
02:19:39.589 --> 02:19:39.599 align:start position:0%
put two hours in the meter so I'm not
 
02:19:41.389 --> 02:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
going to go through my testimony I
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
already submitted it in writing but um I
 
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
just want to kind of go through
 
02:19:46.990 --> 02:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
summarize some of the key points that I
 
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
heard so one of the things that the the
 
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
last gentleman just said was that when
 
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
we had covid it really destabilized our
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
Healthcare work environment we really
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
had to rely on agency nurses to fill
 
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
those vacancies we brought in many many
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
nurses from out of state because there
 
02:20:05.910 --> 02:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
weren't enough Supply in New Hampshire
 
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
so that model worked during an emergency
 
02:20:11.230 --> 02:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
the model also works in areas that are
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
usually lower waged and difficult work
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
environments and I think you heard
 
02:20:17.389 --> 02:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
School nurses you heard prison you heard
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
nursing home so agencies feel a really
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
important role um but what they also do
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
is D stabilize so what we have to do our
 
02:20:29.469 --> 02:20:29.479 align:start position:0%
three things is we need a sustainable
 
02:20:32.190 --> 02:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
permanent Workforce in New Hampshire we
 
02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
need a Workforce that is has freedom of
 
02:20:38.230 --> 02:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
movement and we need a Workforce that's
 
02:20:40.630 --> 02:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
Innovative and so you need permanent
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
staff to do that um one of the things
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
that uh the FTC rule was um mentioned
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
and the key point in that it says that
 
02:20:52.830 --> 02:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
it prohibits employers from entering
 
02:20:55.950 --> 02:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
into non-compete agreements with workers
 
02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
so what this bill does is it fills that
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
loophole so one of the things that this
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill does is look for loopholes so in
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
terms of your question 33 other states
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
have uh filed similar legislation and
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
nine have um totally banned um
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
non-compete so it's certainly when the
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
FTC wrote this it was supposed to go
 
02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
into effect in September
 
02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
2024 and um still pending but what the
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
reason it's pending is that there's a
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
lot of uh lawsuits around the loopholes
 
02:21:29.950 --> 02:21:29.960 align:start position:0%
so what this is to do is to really
 
02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
preemptive um strike against any uh
 
02:21:39.510 --> 02:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
suits um it pro it promotes fundamental
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
freedom of workers to change jobs that's
 
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
important um and the reason that and I
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
think that this was asked around a lot
 
02:21:50.070 --> 02:21:50.080 align:start position:0%
of times the reason that nurses so I
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
taught it UNH for 20 years
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
and students want the ability to change
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
Freedom now this generation so we used
 
02:22:01.230 --> 02:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
to call them travel nurses and you know
 
02:22:02.830 --> 02:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
every once in a while there'd be a nurse
 
02:22:04.670 --> 02:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
who would say I want to move to Hawaii
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
and work and they would get one of these
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
agency contracts and they would move to
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hawaii and work for a year then come
 
02:22:12.990 --> 02:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
back to New Hampshire so what's happened
 
02:22:15.950 --> 02:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
during covid was that nurses realized
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
the um higher wages they could get from
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
this covid emergency they would travel
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
from CMC to the Elliott and be travel
 
02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
nurses get a higher wage get a housing
 
02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
sttip end so it really became an issue
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
that nurses realized what they were
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
finally being able to to get for their
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
worth what the last gentleman said was
 
02:22:39.190 --> 02:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's a market correction so now
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
nurses they had their opportunity to go
 
02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals realized that they don't want
 
02:22:46.790 --> 02:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
to pay 125% of what they were paying
 
02:22:49.510 --> 02:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
before for agency nurses so both the
 
02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
supply is going down and the demand is
 
02:22:53.550 --> 02:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
going out Hospital Association got
 
02:22:54.990 --> 02:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
together to say we're not all going to
 
02:22:57.429 --> 02:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
pay this agency fee anymore we have to
 
02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
all work together to bring it down the
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
problem is that there's a nursing
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
shortage there's not a staffing shortage
 
02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
because we know with nursing agencies
 
02:23:07.309 --> 02:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
they can get the staff to fill the
 
02:23:09.270 --> 02:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
vacancies so where are they getting
 
02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
these people and that's the thing is
 
02:23:12.710 --> 02:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
that they're they are out there
 
02:23:15.230 --> 02:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
recruiting and retaining and that's
 
02:23:17.710 --> 02:23:17.720 align:start position:0%
really important point and then the last
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say is that not all
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
contracts have not competes so I spoke
 
02:23:23.950 --> 02:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
to the hospital Association none of
 
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
their contracts have non-competes so uh
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
when I talked to the CNO at Dartmouth
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
she said any nurse who wants to work at
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth can work at Dartmouth the
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
difference I think you can see is that
 
02:23:38.590 --> 02:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
if I'm a nurse who's going to get out of
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
a contract and work at Dartmouth is a
 
02:23:42.630 --> 02:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
lot different than a nurse who's going
 
02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
to get out of a contract and work at the
 
02:23:46.349 --> 02:23:46.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester School District so nurses
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
want to work in acute care so if they
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
come into the state they work at
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth they realize what the
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
beautiful area is up there they can
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
easily get out of those contracts
 
02:23:57.910 --> 02:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
because Dartmouth doesn't sign a
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
non-compete and neither do the other
 
02:24:02.510 --> 02:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals in the state so this is really
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
to those low hardto fill places like
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
nursing homes like schools like prisons
 
02:24:13.269 --> 02:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
and like home health so we really there
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
has and the final conversation was about
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
how can we balance this bill and there
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
has to be there has to be a place for a
 
02:24:22.349 --> 02:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
gencies or we're really going to
 
02:24:24.269 --> 02:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
experience the nursing shortage and not
 
02:24:26.590 --> 02:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
just the Staffing shortage and we have
 
02:24:28.830 --> 02:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
to figure out what is the role of our
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
permanent and we're doing the nursing
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire nurs Association is
 
02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of work with the healthcare
 
02:24:37.070 --> 02:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce coalition to try to figure
 
02:24:39.710 --> 02:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
these things out so this bill why it's
 
02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
not going to solve all the problems like
 
02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
I think you said over there it's a good
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
first step and we have to really look at
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
those little things that are barriers to
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
our Workforce and once we can Peck away
 
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
at those we can have a more sustainable
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
and permanent Workforce so those are
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
just my summary comments I think from
 
02:24:59.710 --> 02:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
the good discussion that you had here
 
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:01.960 align:start position:0%
today thank you and you emailed that to
 
02:25:04.269 --> 02:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
us already correct I did thank you yep
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%

and so we're making progress not not
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
dramatic progress but I do appreciate
 
03:07:31.030 --> 03:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
your your patience and
 
03:07:33.870 --> 03:07:33.880 align:start position:0%
diligence um I'd like to open the
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 248 relative to notice and
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
update requirements regarding state
 
03:07:41.630 --> 03:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
employee investigations we have with us
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
our very own representative Jack
 
03:07:45.910 --> 03:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
Flanigan to introduce the bill as the
 
03:07:48.309 --> 03:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor sir over to you thank you Mr
 
03:07:49.710 --> 03:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and as a little piece of paper
 
03:07:52.750 --> 03:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
here says my name is Jack Flanigan I
 
03:07:56.469 --> 03:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro 45 which is Hollis
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
Brookline Mason and Greenville which are
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
border towns in the state um position on
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the bill I better support it because I
 
03:08:07.469 --> 03:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
introduced it um I got to be careful
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
because the cases that I'm going to talk
 
03:08:11.670 --> 03:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
about haven't been adjudicated
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
completely but I'm going to share you uh
 
03:08:16.150 --> 03:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
some information that is probably not
 
03:08:19.630 --> 03:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily out of the public but on a
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
specific individual that's been
 
03:08:24.229 --> 03:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
suspended for it'll be year in
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
April they have attempted four grand
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
juries and uh the most recent
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
one uh they found that he deleted an
 
03:08:36.590 --> 03:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
email and he shared some driver's
 
03:08:39.790 --> 03:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
license information to his
 
03:08:42.190 --> 03:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
boss and this is all instigated by the
 
03:08:42.200 --> 03:08:43.950 align:start position:0%
boss and this is all instigated by the
executive

03:08:43.950 --> 03:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
executive
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
branch it just so happens that his wife
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
who was a judge refused to uh hear cases
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
because there was some issue with it
 
03:08:58.269 --> 03:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
relates to the Attorney General's office
 
03:09:01.269 --> 03:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
and she was suspended
 
03:09:06.550 --> 03:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
too um which led me to this bill because
 
03:09:08.790 --> 03:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill basically puts
 
03:09:11.269 --> 03:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
parameters for the executive branch as
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
it relates to suspending an employee and
 
03:09:17.630 --> 03:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
the representative from uh not represent
 
03:09:19.070 --> 03:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
like us but the individual that
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
represents the state employees union has
 
03:09:24.469 --> 03:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
given me an amendment of the bill that I
 
03:09:27.229 --> 03:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
may talk to him about later as it
 
03:09:28.469 --> 03:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
relates to the collective bargaining
 
03:09:30.750 --> 03:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
agreement and how it matches with what
 
03:09:34.830 --> 03:09:34.840 align:start position:0%
they have so the long and short of it is
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
the the people that um that I referenced
 
03:09:40.229 --> 03:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
had never been given notice they never
 
03:09:43.950 --> 03:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
given why they were uh suspended with
 
03:09:46.389 --> 03:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
pay one of them has been being paid a
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
year with without notice although they
 
03:09:51.550 --> 03:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
trumped up something here as it relates
 
03:09:55.710 --> 03:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
to deleting an email Andor um uh the
 
03:09:59.269 --> 03:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
whole sharing information uh with his
 
03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
boss um who needed the information
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
so um I'm sort of constrained on talking
 
03:10:09.469 --> 03:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
about the names but I want to make sure
 
03:10:13.510 --> 03:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
that if it happens again any Town state
 
03:10:16.630 --> 03:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
employee would be given the courtesy of
 
03:10:18.910 --> 03:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
notice why they're being suspended I
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
believe there's also a review period
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
every 90 days to go over what's happened
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
and not happened um and again I'd be
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
better prepared Mr chairman if I had
 
03:10:29.630 --> 03:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
received notice of my individual bill
 
03:10:31.950 --> 03:10:31.960 align:start position:0%
but um I I just don't want it happening
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
again I don't think the uh executive
 
03:10:36.269 --> 03:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
branch should have that kind of power
 
03:10:39.750 --> 03:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
over the employees without due process
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
and that's pretty much what I can tell
 
03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
you about the bill and who who's been
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:10:54.560 --> 03:10:57.389 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chairman thank you
brother

03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:01.150 --> 03:11:01.160 align:start position:0%
Flanigan um I don't see any mention in
 
03:11:04.510 --> 03:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
this uh uh bill of uh the executive
 
03:11:06.510 --> 03:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
branch this would pretty much apply to
 
03:11:09.389 --> 03:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
any employee correct any state employee
 
03:11:12.030 --> 03:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
yes any state yeah okay thank you um
 
03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
just to further answer your question
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
though is I mean if there's a manager
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
out there he would be considered part of
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
the executive because he works for
 
03:11:22.150 --> 03:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately the governor
 
03:11:23.950 --> 03:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay by
 
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
default and I do look forward to
 
03:11:28.590 --> 03:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
collaborating with you on further labor
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
matters we are in the labor committee
 
03:11:32.590 --> 03:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
and we do know they named the county
 
03:11:34.990 --> 03:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
after you Sullivan County because of
 
03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
your generosity and giving him the
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
land any other questions I I do have one
 
03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
question in your in your this doesn't
 
03:11:47.590 --> 03:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
exist already I mean this is like
 
03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
so in your research it doesn't I mean OS
 
03:11:54.349 --> 03:11:54.359 align:start position:0%
would have told me it existed already so
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
in this case I mean I I I will tell you
 
03:11:59.269 --> 03:11:59.279 align:start position:0%
one on-one if you would like but I'm not
 
03:12:01.630 --> 03:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
going to say publicly of the people but
 
03:12:03.630 --> 03:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
you if you put two and two together you
 
03:12:08.790 --> 03:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
can figure out who they are um and um so
 
03:12:10.389 --> 03:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
I don't want some you know defense
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer or prosecutor coming knocking on
 
03:12:13.469 --> 03:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
my door saying you know what did you say
 
03:12:16.389 --> 03:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
what do you know okay um fair enough but
 
03:12:18.269 --> 03:12:18.279 align:start position:0%
I just find it I guess put this way I
 
03:12:20.229 --> 03:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
thought it was totally unfair of how
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
treated okay any other questions yes
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
ma'am hi thank you and thank you Jack
 
03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
would take oh representative that's okay
 
03:12:36.190 --> 03:12:36.200 align:start position:0%
so it you feel sufficient to just have a
 
03:12:40.229 --> 03:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
letter written up uh saying that they
 
03:12:42.309 --> 03:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
can let me see here how do you put it
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
spended pay show the written notice
 
03:12:46.590 --> 03:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient and and how many
 
03:12:46.600 --> 03:12:47.670 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient and and how many
days

03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
should that be
 
03:12:52.429 --> 03:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
given for the if they suspending
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
somebody they'd have to give them
 
03:12:55.469 --> 03:12:55.479 align:start position:0%
written notice okay prior to the
 
03:12:57.070 --> 03:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
suspension you're saying or at the same
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
time at the same time and the reality is
 
03:13:02.389 --> 03:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
is without that written notice it's sort
 
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
of like you get a job right you get a
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
job they give you a letter say hey
 
03:13:08.429 --> 03:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
congratulations we hired you um in this
 
03:13:10.750 --> 03:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
case it's hey we're suspending you but
 
03:13:13.150 --> 03:13:13.160 align:start position:0%
you need a formal process which would be
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.269 --> 03:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah represent K go ahead thank
 
03:13:24.990 --> 03:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Flanigan
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure I'm not an attorney uh
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
but is it possible that giving a the
 
03:13:34.030 --> 03:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
reason for the suspension could
 
03:13:35.550 --> 03:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the
 
03:13:38.190 --> 03:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
investigation you me the RE from from my
 
03:13:40.389 --> 03:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
perspective you mean well I mean just
 
03:13:42.190 --> 03:13:42.200 align:start position:0%
legally you know if you're if you're
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
investigate follow up explanation yeah
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sir so if you mean if I
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
were investigating something that I
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
thought you did correct and I wanted to
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
be sure to protect the evidence that
 
03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
might exist from disappearing or
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
something else happening maybe would it
 
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
be uh appropriate for me not to tell you
 
03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
why I'm investigating you so I could
 
03:14:05.790 --> 03:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
better find that information do I I
 
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
probably to tell a judge or somebody
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
what's up right well um to answer your
 
03:14:12.550 --> 03:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
question a lot of the stuff would be
 
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
exculpatory in other words it it'd be if
 
03:14:17.429 --> 03:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
especially if there's legal action you
 
03:14:19.110 --> 03:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh you you would have to receive some
 
03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
formal notice of what you did wrong I
 
03:14:23.389 --> 03:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
mean especially if there's going to be a
 
03:14:27.070 --> 03:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
termination involved so I mean I see
 
03:14:29.870 --> 03:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
your point um especially when it deals
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
with labor law there may be uh some
 
03:14:35.469 --> 03:14:35.479 align:start position:0%
constraints but as I think the right
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
thing to do is be telling the person
 
03:14:38.990 --> 03:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
what they did right or wrong especially
 
03:14:40.510 --> 03:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
right in these days because this very
 
03:14:42.510 --> 03:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
rarely happens but wrong specifically in
 
03:14:45.710 --> 03:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
this issues so yeah I mean I'm I don't
 
03:14:47.469 --> 03:14:47.479 align:start position:0%
disagree with you but I I see a point
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
but I don't necessarily agree with you
 
03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah all right thank you for
 
03:14:55.630 --> 03:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and uh if I could
 
03:15:01.910 --> 03:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
please yeah
 
03:15:06.670 --> 03:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr chairman with your permission
 
03:15:18.309 --> 03:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
03:15:21.469 --> 03:15:21.479 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
Bob blazel I am a senior lobbyist with
 
03:15:27.349 --> 03:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
the state employees Association here in
 
03:15:31.630 --> 03:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
conquer um I am on the um card as uh
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
being opposed to the bill but I I do
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that I I absolutely
 
03:15:40.590 --> 03:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
agree with the sponsor's
 
03:15:44.469 --> 03:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
intent and when you all get this um
 
03:15:47.349 --> 03:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
around my proposed amendment what you
 
03:15:50.510 --> 03:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
will see is the bill as produc as as as
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
introduced um this language already does
 
03:15:55.590 --> 03:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
exist within the collect the bargaining
 
03:15:58.110 --> 03:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
agreement if you flip on the other
 
03:16:01.030 --> 03:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
side um of the paper I showed you you
 
03:16:03.630 --> 03:16:03.640 align:start position:0%
will see that currently the the bargain
 
03:16:05.469 --> 03:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
language um if someone's under
 
03:16:06.750 --> 03:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
investigation they're supposed to get an
 
03:16:08.349 --> 03:16:08.359 align:start position:0%
update every two
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
weeks so if you are um a state employee
 
03:16:13.189 --> 03:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a member of the
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
Union that is the current language if
 
03:16:18.030 --> 03:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
you're under investigation
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
um so the way the bill is written would
 
03:16:22.870 --> 03:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
essentially be a major step backwards
 
03:16:27.389 --> 03:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
for state employees um so you know if I
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
always thought like rather than killing
 
03:16:31.150 --> 03:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
a bill if if you can come to like an
 
03:16:34.309 --> 03:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
agreement U somehow of a of a compromise
 
03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:35.479 align:start position:0%
um that's why I have that Amendment
 
03:16:38.389 --> 03:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
before you um because it basically says
 
03:16:42.510 --> 03:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
um 90 days um or language and a collect
 
03:16:44.590 --> 03:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
the bargain you agreement whichever is
 
03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
sooner um understanding now I think I
 
03:16:48.229 --> 03:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
have a little bit better understanding
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
of what representative Flanigan um is is
 
03:16:53.150 --> 03:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
saying then then maybe I would amend my
 
03:16:56.910 --> 03:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and and say for executive um
 
03:17:00.469 --> 03:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
employees and state employees um that it
 
03:17:02.429 --> 03:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
mirrored the collective bargaining
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
language where they get notified every
 
03:17:06.429 --> 03:17:06.439 align:start position:0%
two weeks as to what's going on with
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
them and I think they deserve to know um
 
03:17:15.950 --> 03:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
rather than uh 90 days so um I I hope
 
03:17:19.150 --> 03:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
you I hope I was clear um that this
 
03:17:21.910 --> 03:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
would as as written um as introduced
 
03:17:23.269 --> 03:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
would be a major step backwards for
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
state employees please consider the
 
03:17:27.670 --> 03:17:27.680 align:start position:0%
amendment um and further consider it if
 
03:17:29.349 --> 03:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
you want to Encompass absolutely
 
03:17:30.830 --> 03:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
everybody whether you're the executive
 
03:17:33.630 --> 03:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
level or not if you feel that um any
 
03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
employee what regardless of your status
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
um you should be notified every two
 
03:17:40.389 --> 03:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
weeks um that's what we feel is
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'll take any
 
03:17:45.150 --> 03:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
03:17:47.429 --> 03:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
Salin thank you Mr chair
 
03:17:49.550 --> 03:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question if if
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not and I don't oppose anything you
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
said about changing it to two weeks um
 
03:17:57.469 --> 03:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
but uh if it went through as drafted my
 
03:17:58.990 --> 03:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
impression is that a collective
 
03:18:03.950 --> 03:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement um can um provide
 
03:18:08.349 --> 03:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
um a an enhanced uh set of um terms and
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
conditions over what the law might
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.150 --> 03:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
so I would probably want to talk to a
 
03:18:19.670 --> 03:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
lawyer a labor lawyer I was in labor but
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer um but I it it seems to
 
03:18:26.630 --> 03:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
me that um the the bill as proposed
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
would not interfere with um the um uh
 
03:18:31.590 --> 03:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
what's in the collective bargaining
 
03:18:33.630 --> 03:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
agreement you would still enjoy an
 
03:18:36.269 --> 03:18:36.279 align:start position:0%
enhanced version of the notification
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
rights do
 
03:18:40.469 --> 03:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
you what what are your thoughts on that
 
03:18:42.910 --> 03:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
so uh to be absolutely clear I am not an
 
03:18:45.790 --> 03:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
attorney okay um so I agree with your
 
03:18:47.110 --> 03:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
assessment of you want to talk to a
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:54.550 --> 03:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming since there're be uh
 
03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
negotiation signed off with the state
 
03:18:59.070 --> 03:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
that if they have um language within
 
03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
their collective bargaining agreement
 
03:19:02.510 --> 03:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
that if it's different then say if you
 
03:19:04.710 --> 03:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
pass this that the collective bargaining
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
agreement will prevail I don't know I
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that um that's
 
03:19:12.429 --> 03:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
above my pay grade um but I will I will
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of very good skilled labor
 
03:19:17.309 --> 03:19:17.319 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I'm I'm sure um I can get
 
03:19:19.550 --> 03:19:19.560 align:start position:0%
you an answer very very
 
03:19:23.670 --> 03:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
soon followup for a followup I I I'm
 
03:19:25.309 --> 03:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
aware that we do have two attorneys
 
03:19:27.670 --> 03:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back of the room they are
 
03:19:29.830 --> 03:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
department of labor attorneys whether
 
03:19:31.389 --> 03:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
they're they consider themselves labor
 
03:19:33.990 --> 03:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys I'm not
 
03:19:38.950 --> 03:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
sure I I think um overall my my sense is
 
03:19:41.830 --> 03:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
that I think we all want an employee
 
03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of status to have appropriate
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
notification that's my sense and so I'm
 
03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
happy to work with uh the employee uh
 
03:19:53.790 --> 03:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.120 align:start position:0%

oh have
 
03:20:41.950 --> 03:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
Sor oh yeah we will
 
03:20:44.189 --> 03:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:20:46.910 --> 03:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
to the Liberty uh of my fellow U
 
03:20:49.189 --> 03:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
committee members um I don't have a
 
03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
problem with the amendment that he's got
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
because it defaults either one or the
 
03:20:54.790 --> 03:20:54.800 align:start position:0%
other depending and for example in this
 
03:20:56.229 --> 03:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
case it's a collective bargain agreement
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
that already has it but my reference was
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
the executive branch or the executive
 
03:21:04.429 --> 03:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
employees are not covered by the CBA so
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
his his Amendment would cover both CBA
 
03:21:10.349 --> 03:21:10.359 align:start position:0%
employees and executive employees so I
 
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with that and if
 
03:21:13.110 --> 03:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
you if you know I can put in the
 
03:21:15.110 --> 03:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
amendment today and get it out and for
 
03:21:17.670 --> 03:21:17.680 align:start position:0%

employees that would be covered by this
 
03:23:22.750 --> 03:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:25.790 --> 03:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
CBA no this this bill seems like a reply
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the entire state employees what
 
03:23:31.389 --> 03:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
percentage would be under CBA as for
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:59.469 --> 03:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
isn't it single digits like 10% I don't
 
03:24:01.229 --> 03:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
I don't yeah state employees are
 
03:24:01.239 --> 03:24:24.670 align:start position:0%
I don't yeah state employees are
unionized

03:24:24.670 --> 03:24:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:31.550 --> 03:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:33.349 --> 03:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
question and another do you have a
 
03:24:34.590 --> 03:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
question yeah another question if you
 
03:24:39.630 --> 03:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
don't mind thank you it's the OSS or you
 
03:24:44.790 --> 03:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
decid to put this new section in 21-
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:52.269 --> 03:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
1-i is all about Department of
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
administrative Services it just seemed
 
03:24:56.110 --> 03:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
like a weird place to stick this in and
 
03:24:59.910 --> 03:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
not somewhere else in labor do you did
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
you have any say in that I just wonder
 
03:25:03.870 --> 03:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
if the people
 
03:25:05.950 --> 03:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor have a
 
03:25:09.070 --> 03:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
bigger picture of how how the uh rsas
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
are numbered would have an opinion on
 
03:25:15.309 --> 03:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
anybody lot like insurance and you know
 
03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't include Labor uh but uh you know
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit of buildings and
 
03:25:29.550 --> 03:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
things like that um but
 
03:25:33.429 --> 03:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
uh I'm you know it's administrative so I
 
03:25:35.469 --> 03:25:35.479 align:start position:0%
don't I guess they would have coverage
 
03:25:37.910 --> 03:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
over someone has to approve the PDA
 
03:25:40.150 --> 03:25:40.160 align:start position:0%
isn't that the governor it represents
 
03:25:42.189 --> 03:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
Soloman do you have input the uh public
 
03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
employer labor Labor Relations Board
 
03:25:47.790 --> 03:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
actually covers the uh
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
um the bargaining rights and such for
 
03:25:52.510 --> 03:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
public employees in New Hampshire not
 
03:25:55.189 --> 03:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor so uh that week
 
03:25:56.590 --> 03:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
actually ran into that with one of the
 
03:26:02.590 --> 03:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
bills we've discussed um but um uh
 
03:26:05.510 --> 03:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
it I I'm not sure exactly what section
 
03:26:07.830 --> 03:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
of uh law this uh administrative
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
Services is um but um it may very well
 
03:26:16.670 --> 03:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:21.110 --> 03:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:24.030 --> 03:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
please um represent that's that's a very
 
03:26:27.269 --> 03:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
good question um why it's under admin
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
Services um section 21i 42 relates to
 
03:26:36.189 --> 03:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
personnel and if you go to 21- i42 Roman
 
03:26:39.870 --> 03:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
numeral 1 it says managing a centralized
 
03:26:41.950 --> 03:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
Human Resources processing operation
 
03:26:44.309 --> 03:26:44.319 align:start position:0%

promotion transfer layoff removal and
 
03:26:52.269 --> 03:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
discipline of state employees so I
 
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
believe it is in the right
 
03:26:56.510 --> 03:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
section thank you very much that's
 
03:26:57.750 --> 03:26:57.760 align:start position:0%

I'm the Deputy Commissioner of the New
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor um by and
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
large the department doesn't enforce
 
03:27:38.750 --> 03:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
anything that falls under 21i my
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
recollection and I can um follow up in
 
03:27:42.550 --> 03:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
writing just to verify as I believe
 
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
there is one small
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
provision at
 
03:27:50.110 --> 03:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
21i that dictates ongoing Indemnity
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
payment or uh I'm sorry ongoing salary
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%

General understanding of the statutes
 
03:28:04.309 --> 03:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
existence as you know state employees
 
03:28:06.510 --> 03:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
ourselves but we're not administering to
 
03:28:08.030 --> 03:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
or have jurisdiction over any of its
 
03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
Provisions other than that very small
 
03:28:12.389 --> 03:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
comp piece followup for followup sir so
 
03:28:15.269 --> 03:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
if a employee was AG grieved by this
 
03:28:16.750 --> 03:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't go to you there would go
 
03:28:19.710 --> 03:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
to as that La that laid them off or
 
03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
disciplined them yes it would be between
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
them and their agency and in general for

my first three terms in the house I'm in
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
my fifth term now uh the bill before you
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
um has a little bit of history on it and
 
03:46:44.950 --> 03:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
I will say that over my three terms on
 
03:46:47.229 --> 03:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
the labor committee that uh We've uh
 
03:46:50.429 --> 03:46:50.439 align:start position:0%
we've had multiple bills come up uh
 
03:46:53.349 --> 03:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
addressing this particular section of
 
03:46:53.359 --> 03:46:54.349 align:start position:0%
addressing this particular section of
the

03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
rsas um one of them in particular has
 
03:46:59.870 --> 03:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
come up many times that
 
03:47:03.790 --> 03:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
was bills on the the use in of payroll
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
cards matter of fact we had one last
 
03:47:11.229 --> 03:47:11.239 align:start position:0%
term this committee ited it um we the
 
03:47:13.670 --> 03:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
payroll cards I I believe are an awful
 
03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:17.439 align:start position:0%
solution for wai employees to uh to be
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
paid um but on my last term on labor
 
03:47:24.510 --> 03:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
again we had a a bill on the on the
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
payroll cards and it ended up in a
 
03:47:30.550 --> 03:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
committee of conference which I was a
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
member of at that time uh Senator Carson
 
03:47:35.510 --> 03:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
represented the committee of conference
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
from the Senate side and they were in
 
03:47:39.750 --> 03:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
favor of increasing the use of the
 
03:47:42.110 --> 03:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
payroll cards uh we in the house were
 
03:47:45.070 --> 03:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
not uh the committee of conference ended
 
03:47:45.080 --> 03:47:46.189 align:start position:0%
not uh the committee of conference ended
without

03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
concurrence but I told Senator Carson at
 
03:47:50.790 --> 03:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
the time that uh at some point in the
 
03:47:53.630 --> 03:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
future I'd profer legislation that would
 
03:47:56.950 --> 03:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
remove hundreds of words of regulatory
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
language which the employers uh must
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
currently de employers and employees
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
must currently de uh deal with and
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that's what this legislation does um I
 
03:48:08.229 --> 03:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
had originally told her I thought it
 
03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
would be about 750 words turns out to be
 
03:48:13.630 --> 03:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
430 words of regulations that are
 
03:48:13.640 --> 03:48:16.229 align:start position:0%
430 words of regulations that are
removed

03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
removed
 
03:48:18.550 --> 03:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
um couple things I want to point out
 
03:48:20.590 --> 03:48:20.600 align:start position:0%
before I talk about what the goal of it
 
03:48:25.389 --> 03:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
is um the enforcement by the department
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
Remains the Same with the exception of a
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
single line and that is if you go to
 
03:48:35.870 --> 03:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
page two on the bill uh line 26 it talks
 
03:48:38.870 --> 03:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
about the repeal of 2731
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
a3b and what that does is uh that RSA
 
03:48:46.510 --> 03:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
says payment of wages by checks on fin
 
03:48:48.790 --> 03:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
financial institutions that is not
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
convenient to the place of employment uh
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
the only reason that is eliminated
 
03:48:55.389 --> 03:48:55.399 align:start position:0%
because in the 430 words that we do
 
03:48:59.070 --> 03:48:59.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate that was one of the issues um
 
03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
that was eliminated other than that the
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
regulatory language
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
remains so what are the goals of the
 
03:49:08.550 --> 03:49:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill first it's to reduce regulatory
 
03:49:10.950 --> 03:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
burdens on our businesses all businesses
 
03:49:12.510 --> 03:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
not a specific
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
industry um we're not here to or I'm not
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
here to promote special interests of
 
03:49:20.110 --> 03:49:20.120 align:start position:0%
those who produce or in the business of
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
the payroll
 
03:49:24.630 --> 03:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
cards and above all we want to allow the
 
03:49:27.110 --> 03:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
free market and the employer employee
 
03:49:29.670 --> 03:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
relationship to decide how and in what
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
form wages will be paid if the employee
 
03:49:35.309 --> 03:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
agrees with the employer they have their
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
Arrangement without interference without
 
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
government bureaucracy or mandates that
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:50.229 --> 03:49:50.239 align:start position:0%
now you will see
 
03:49:54.269 --> 03:49:54.279 align:start position:0%
uh one other thing mention before I
 
03:49:55.950 --> 03:49:55.960 align:start position:0%
continue on here at the be very
 
03:49:58.189 --> 03:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill on line three
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
there's existing language that remains
 
03:50:03.510 --> 03:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
and that is um whether or not the
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
employer pays within 8 days or within 15
 
03:50:09.389 --> 03:50:09.399 align:start position:0%
days that was actually in my second term
 
03:50:13.149 --> 03:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
a u a bill I put through at the time it
 
03:50:15.389 --> 03:50:15.399 align:start position:0%
you had to pay Within days unless you
 
03:50:17.670 --> 03:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
had a special exception from the
 
03:50:19.870 --> 03:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
department and I put in that bill to
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
make it every year uh if if the employer
 
03:50:25.149 --> 03:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to pay every two weeks he could
 
03:50:27.790 --> 03:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
do it that way
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I know in the past we've
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
heard um some of the reasons for not
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
doing this um well you know some people
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't have bank
 
03:50:42.309 --> 03:50:42.319 align:start position:0%
accounts well what what I will say about
 
03:50:44.670 --> 03:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
that I think there's probably less than
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
than the number of people in the state
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
the number of fingers on my hands that
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't have um bank
 
03:50:54.790 --> 03:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
accounts um they need to and if they
 
03:50:57.189 --> 03:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't they need to find an alternative
 
03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
way uh to make that happen or the
 
03:51:03.510 --> 03:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
employer if it's a valued
 
03:51:06.630 --> 03:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
employee the employer can say hey I will
 
03:51:08.429 --> 03:51:08.439 align:start position:0%
take care of you and we will pay your
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
wages in another form if they
 
03:51:16.750 --> 03:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
the main as I said we eliminate 430
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
words and all those ways of how a
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
business must pay or an employer must
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
pay an employee is replaced by a single
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
paragraph and that paragraph is the
 
03:51:37.429 --> 03:51:37.439 align:start position:0%
manner in which the payment is made
 
03:51:39.750 --> 03:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
shall be determined by the employer the
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
employer shall honor before the first
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
day of employment inform the employee in
 
03:51:46.990 --> 03:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
writing the manner in which payment
 
03:51:49.630 --> 03:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
shall be made at any time an employer
 
03:51:51.670 --> 03:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
intends to change its method of payment
 
03:51:53.309 --> 03:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
each employee shall be given written
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
notice no less than 90 days prior to
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
that change now I anticipate a question
 
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
of maybe does that apply to all
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
employees some of the
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
employees guess what that's up to the
 
03:52:12.550 --> 03:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.590 --> 03:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
relationship I anticipate somebody's is
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to say well what happens if the
 
03:52:17.710 --> 03:52:17.720 align:start position:0%
employer decides to pay their employees
 
03:52:20.429 --> 03:52:20.439 align:start position:0%
in silver or
 
03:52:22.950 --> 03:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
gold the employee can
 
03:52:29.469 --> 03:52:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
there of course I will say that the
 
03:52:34.429 --> 03:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
chance of this happening is about as
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
like likely as an employee being hit by
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
lightning we know that probably 98% of
 
03:52:42.030 --> 03:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
all employees currently in the state are
 
03:52:45.189 --> 03:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
paid by either automatic uh payroll
 
03:52:49.830 --> 03:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.269 --> 03:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
check the what if what about the
 
03:52:53.910 --> 03:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
employer says I want to pay you in
 
03:52:56.189 --> 03:52:56.199 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin I know one individual on this
 
03:52:57.870 --> 03:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
committee is going to not like this
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
answer but I would say if I was the
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
employee I'd say run away from that
 
03:53:06.110 --> 03:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
employer because his macroeconomic sense
 
03:53:07.790 --> 03:53:07.800 align:start position:0%
isn't very good you don't want to be
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
involved with that
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
employer um so anyway that's basically
 
03:53:15.750 --> 03:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
what the what the bill does simply Rel
 
03:53:17.910 --> 03:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
eliminates a whole bunch of regulatory
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
burden puts the employer employee
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
relationship um
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
together and that's it I'd be happy to
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions any questions
 
03:53:30.590 --> 03:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative kill thank you represent
 
03:53:33.710 --> 03:53:33.720 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh brother
 
03:53:37.389 --> 03:53:37.399 align:start position:0%
turkot um does it it sounds to me you'll
 
03:53:38.870 --> 03:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but it does
 
03:53:41.429 --> 03:53:41.439 align:start position:0%
sound like agreeing to the gold and
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
silver or perhaps the kangaroo pelt uh
 
03:53:46.830 --> 03:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
would be a condition of employment if I
 
03:53:48.910 --> 03:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
don't want the kangaroo Pelt or gold and
 
03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
silver if I want cash I I don't have any
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
recourse as a pro as an employee is that
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
correct no you absolutely have a
 
03:54:00.189 --> 03:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
recourse your recourse is to either work
 
03:54:03.990 --> 03:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
for Kangaroo pelts or grains of sand or
 
03:54:06.910 --> 03:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the employer wishes to pay you
 
03:54:10.309 --> 03:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
in again we know that
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
98% probably closer to 100% of
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
individuals are played by paid by
 
03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
automatic payroll deposit or check so
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
but follow up for followup yes sir but
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
the the the choice is either work for
 
03:54:26.750 --> 03:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
this employer who wants to pay me in
 
03:54:29.269 --> 03:54:29.279 align:start position:0%
these other Fashions or not it's a
 
03:54:30.790 --> 03:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
condition of employment which I think we
 
03:54:32.830 --> 03:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
have found problematic in some of our
 
03:54:32.840 --> 03:54:34.950 align:start position:0%
have found problematic in some of our
other

03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
discussions uh such as union membership
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
or things like that if it's a condition
 
03:54:43.670 --> 03:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
of employment or even uh uh tipped wages
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
we can't you know
 
03:54:47.269 --> 03:54:47.279 align:start position:0%
tip pooling condition of employment is a
 
03:54:50.950 --> 03:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
rather sensitive area in labor law as a
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
union member myself of 40 years I will
 
03:54:59.950 --> 03:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
say that most um any any employer that's
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
involved with a Union
 
03:55:05.870 --> 03:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
contract having written lots of Union
 
03:55:08.349 --> 03:55:08.359 align:start position:0%
language and been involved with that
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
stuff for eight years of my career um
 
03:55:13.349 --> 03:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the Union contract will take
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
care of how payment is made if the
 
03:55:18.110 --> 03:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
employer decided they were going to try
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
to pay their employees in kangaroo
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
pelts oh stop oh can I can I have
 
03:55:28.269 --> 03:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
another may I have another yes sir you
 
03:55:31.710 --> 03:55:31.720 align:start position:0%
may thank you sir um and again thank you
 
03:55:36.349 --> 03:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
for your patience um it it does seem to
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
low open the door to payroll cards which
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
again we have this committee has as
 
03:55:44.990 --> 03:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
recently as this year has voted against
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
and any and it doesn't seem to offer any
 
03:55:50.309 --> 03:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
really protections to the employer to
 
03:55:53.750 --> 03:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
the employee such as the bank account a
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
bank near near the place of employment
 
03:55:59.149 --> 03:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
or it and do you know that there are a
 
03:56:01.070 --> 03:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
lot more than 10 people in the state
 
03:56:04.349 --> 03:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
that don't have bank accounts I'm I'm
 
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
volunteering at a food pantry tomorrow
 
03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
and I could bet that maybe 10 of the
 
03:56:11.830 --> 03:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
hundred people that will serve have a
 
03:56:14.429 --> 03:56:14.439 align:start position:0%
bank account
 
03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
and I guess would you believe I I would
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
to say I didn't hear much of a question
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
there but uh then I would say for those
 
03:56:23.550 --> 03:56:23.560 align:start position:0%
10 individuals um they're obviously
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
getting paid
 
03:56:28.750 --> 03:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
somehow representative
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
stop thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if uh my question
 
03:56:37.469 --> 03:56:37.479 align:start position:0%
is if an employer decides to pay their
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
employee in something that's not
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
considered legal tender or or
 
03:56:43.389 --> 03:56:43.399 align:start position:0%
traditional funds like potatoes or
 
03:56:47.469 --> 03:56:47.479 align:start position:0%
something how would you manage um
 
03:56:51.149 --> 03:56:51.159 align:start position:0%
withholdings I know like a tax income
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
tax this bill does nothing to speak
 
03:56:57.070 --> 03:56:57.080 align:start position:0%
about withholding none of those rsas
 
03:56:58.950 --> 03:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
change none of the enforcement
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
mechanisms change the only thing this
 
03:57:05.990 --> 03:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
changes is how the employer is paid uh
 
03:57:08.189 --> 03:57:08.199 align:start position:0%
employees are paid again I'll say it
 
03:57:12.670 --> 03:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
again we know that an majority of our
 
03:57:14.429 --> 03:57:14.439 align:start position:0%
employers are not going to be paying
 
03:57:17.110 --> 03:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
their employees in potatoes or kangaroo
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
skins they're going to be paying them
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
normally in legal tender what this does
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.910 --> 03:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
liinatamberg chman thank you for taking
 
03:57:47.950 --> 03:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
my question sure um I also have
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
bargained a fair number of collective
 
03:57:53.269 --> 03:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements and
 
03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
um do you when you're when you've got
 
03:58:00.670 --> 03:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
your union hat on um is
 
03:58:03.149 --> 03:58:03.159 align:start position:0%
it the norm for you to say that the
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
employer can do whatever they the
 
03:58:05.279 --> 03:58:07.229 align:start position:0%
employer can do whatever they the
employer

03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
employer
 
03:58:10.429 --> 03:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
wants um I no longer have my union hat
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
on as a negotiator or representative of
 
03:58:16.110 --> 03:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
my union like I did for8 years I am here
 
03:58:20.429 --> 03:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
today speaking about removing 430 words
 
03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
out of our current rsay that don't need
 
03:58:25.830 --> 03:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
to be there followup please but would
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
you agree that this what this bill does
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
is it says the employer can do whatever
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
the employer wants
 
03:58:33.040 --> 03:58:34.870 align:start position:0%
the employer wants
no

03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay represent fton would this allow for
 
03:58:41.630 --> 03:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
either more opportunities or an economic
 
03:58:46.590 --> 03:58:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:48.750 --> 03:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
employees that's kind of like a
 
03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
macroeconomic question possibly I don't
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to
 
03:58:57.550 --> 03:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
that representive King thank you Mr
 
03:58:59.309 --> 03:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm reading through the portal
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
here and there's a lot of the same uh
 
03:59:02.229 --> 03:59:02.239 align:start position:0%
sentiment of questions and I wanted to
 
03:59:04.429 --> 03:59:04.439 align:start position:0%
see if you could answer it for me um it
 
03:59:06.510 --> 03:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
says that there is um this would
 
03:59:09.189 --> 03:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
unilaterally allow employers to charge
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
or change the way that an employee is
 
03:59:14.469 --> 03:59:14.479 align:start position:0%
paid it would also make it uh a ailable
 
03:59:16.309 --> 03:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
so that they could our employees could
 
03:59:19.910 --> 03:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
inquire or get more fees when it comes
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
to getting their paychecks so could you
 
03:59:24.149 --> 03:59:24.159 align:start position:0%
just mention that last that last line I
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
missed that last one yep yep the um it
 
03:59:28.349 --> 03:59:28.359 align:start position:0%
the way that it's written there's a lot
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
of people are saying that this could
 
03:59:32.429 --> 03:59:32.439 align:start position:0%
also make it so an employer could now
 
03:59:34.469 --> 03:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
choose a payment option that would
 
03:59:36.670 --> 03:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
require the employee to pay extra fees
 
03:59:38.309 --> 03:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
to get their
 
03:59:43.030 --> 03:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
paycheck possible yes but again what
 
03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it
 
03:59:49.349 --> 03:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
gets bureaucracy out of the employer
 
03:59:51.389 --> 03:59:51.399 align:start position:0%
employee relationship that's the goal of
 
03:59:54.990 --> 03:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
this bill again um as an employee I
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
don't have to work for American Airlines
 
03:59:59.149 --> 03:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
I choose to work for American Airlines
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
because of the way I'm
 
04:00:05.349 --> 04:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
paid um my Union
 
04:00:08.229 --> 04:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
contract um and different things I don't
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
have to work for American Airlines I
 
04:00:11.309 --> 04:00:11.319 align:start position:0%
could leave American Airlines and go
 
04:00:13.030 --> 04:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere else if American came to me
 
04:00:15.149 --> 04:00:15.159 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and said uh we're going to just
 
04:00:16.590 --> 04:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
start we're going to start charging you
 
04:00:18.670 --> 04:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
a 10% fee for the production of your
 
04:00:18.680 --> 04:00:20.950 align:start position:0%
a 10% fee for the production of your
paycheck

04:00:20.950 --> 04:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
so representative Granger thank you Mr
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
04:00:26.950 --> 04:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
so in the bill it says the employee
 
04:00:28.349 --> 04:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
shall be given written notice no less
 
04:00:30.590 --> 04:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
than 90 days prior to the change what's
 
04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that
 
04:00:35.110 --> 04:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
line um
 
04:00:39.830 --> 04:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
well let's just say the employer began
 
04:00:42.269 --> 04:00:42.279 align:start position:0%
uh when the employee got hired and he
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
said we are going to be paying you with
 
04:00:47.990 --> 04:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
papercheck okay so they sign their their
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
contractual the employer writes out this
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
is how we're going to get paid you're
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
going to get paid with a paper check
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
later on he decides it's more efficient
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
for me and most of my employees to pay
 
04:01:03.149 --> 04:01:03.159 align:start position:0%
you with automatic payroll deposit I'm
 
04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
going to do that so 90
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
days before they go to automatic payroll
 
04:01:12.030 --> 04:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
deposit the employer would have to
 
04:01:13.950 --> 04:01:13.960 align:start position:0%
inform his employees this is what I'm
 
04:01:16.630 --> 04:01:16.640 align:start position:0%
going to do in 90 days thank you very
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome representative
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
sylvestro hi thank you sir and thank you
 
04:01:23.830 --> 04:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
so who came up with this idea who thinks
 
04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
it's the bureaucracy how many employers
 
04:01:31.670 --> 04:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
came to you saying they were upset with
 
04:01:33.389 --> 04:01:33.399 align:start position:0%
the restrictions would it be somebody
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
like representative avalani that came to
 
04:01:37.309 --> 04:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
you and said hey I don't like the way I
 
04:01:40.830 --> 04:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
want more control how I pay my employees
 
04:01:43.510 --> 04:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
why is this an issue why is this an
 
04:01:43.520 --> 04:01:45.070 align:start position:0%
why is this an issue why is this an
issue

04:01:45.070 --> 04:01:45.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
I I'll
 
04:01:49.030 --> 04:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
reemphasize the reason I brought this
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
forward this was the result of a
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to call it a promise but
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
um something I said to the senator um in
 
04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference because we
 
04:02:04.229 --> 04:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
couldn't come to an agreement on
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
something and I said I will I missed it
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
by a session because I forgot last
 
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
session but I said I'm going to bring
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
you back and we're going to eliminate a
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
lot of this language so we can free up
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
the employer employee relationship
 
04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's it nobody no specific individual
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
or specific business came to me this is
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
something that I've been wanting to do
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
since I was on labor
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:02:30.110 --> 04:02:30.120 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair would you
 
04:02:32.030 --> 04:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the former chair of this
 
04:02:34.030 --> 04:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee will infantine also has
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
expressed that we should really just get
 
04:02:36.870 --> 04:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
rid of this whole chapter or do
 
04:02:37.990 --> 04:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
something similar to what you're
 
04:02:41.429 --> 04:02:41.439 align:start position:0%
expressing this bill I would definitely
 
04:02:45.070 --> 04:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
believe that having known will very well
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
again my goal originally was to go for
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
750 words to eliminate but uh I was
 
04:02:55.149 --> 04:02:55.159 align:start position:0%
advised that maybe 430 would be better
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
for now so all right and representative
 
04:03:02.670 --> 04:03:02.680 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you
 
04:03:05.790 --> 04:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
um so the employee shall honor before
 
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:07.600 align:start position:0%
the first day of employment employ and
 
04:03:09.469 --> 04:03:09.479 align:start position:0%
inform the employee in writing the
 
04:03:11.309 --> 04:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
manner of which payment shall be made so
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
kind of going back to a person that may
 
04:03:16.790 --> 04:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
not even believe in checking accounts or
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
savings accounts or being involved with
 
04:03:22.070 --> 04:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
banks if you told me that I had to have
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
direct deposit is that a little
 
04:03:27.309 --> 04:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I would say that would be
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
up between the employer and the employee
 
04:03:32.070 --> 04:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's what a contract is um You can
 
04:03:35.149 --> 04:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
call it discriminatory if you want um
 
04:03:37.910 --> 04:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
but if I if you came to me and I said
 
04:03:39.550 --> 04:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
hey look the only way I'm going to pay
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
you in my business is through automatic
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
payroll um AC whatever they call it
 
04:03:47.189 --> 04:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
direct deposit and you said well I can't
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
do that you have to do something else
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say sorry this is how I run
 
04:03:53.710 --> 04:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
my business this is the whole purpose of
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is to give the employer and
 
04:03:59.630 --> 04:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
the employee the ability to decide how
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
that Arrangement is going to
 
04:04:04.630 --> 04:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
work just a pleas followup just um so
 
04:04:04.640 --> 04:04:05.429 align:start position:0%
work just a pleas followup just um so
that's

04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:04:08.110 --> 04:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
really I guess like you could say you
 
04:04:10.030 --> 04:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
the your uh choice is to not take the
 
04:04:12.469 --> 04:04:12.479 align:start position:0%
job right
 
04:04:14.349 --> 04:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
exactly thank you
 
04:04:16.269 --> 04:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
representa McKenzie do you have a
 
04:04:18.229 --> 04:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
question I got
 
04:04:21.750 --> 04:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
few uh can we representative drill down
 
04:04:25.630 --> 04:04:25.640 align:start position:0%
into the section uh the deals on line 21
 
04:04:27.630 --> 04:04:27.640 align:start position:0%
with uh Health and Welfare funds
 
04:04:30.469 --> 04:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements um and
 
04:04:32.309 --> 04:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
more importantly the whole question
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
about um other agreements adopted for
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
the benefit of employees agreeded by
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
employees should be paid by the employer
 
04:04:41.590 --> 04:04:41.600 align:start position:0%
within 30 days and that includes uh
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
Health and Welfare funds so
 
04:04:47.389 --> 04:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
what is the net effect and maybe we'll
 
04:04:48.429 --> 04:04:48.439 align:start position:0%
hear from the attorneys from the
 
04:04:49.870 --> 04:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Le what is the net effect
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
of re of removing all of that language
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
that deals with when you get paid how
 
04:04:57.110 --> 04:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
you paid uh how these things how these
 
04:05:01.750 --> 04:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
funds are paid and then also um in the
 
04:05:05.469 --> 04:05:05.479 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining environment um you
 
04:05:08.189 --> 04:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
know this this recognizes that what is
 
04:05:09.990 --> 04:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
your bill what what does this do when
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
you wipe all these sections out of the
 
04:05:14.830 --> 04:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
out of the current law uh and how do
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
these things get paid and what is the
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
what precedent do the collective buing
 
04:05:21.710 --> 04:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
agreements have considering they all
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably have languages Rel as it
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
relates to uh how they're going to get
 
04:05:28.469 --> 04:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
paid that's a very lengthy question and
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
what I will do is I will go back and
 
04:05:32.110 --> 04:05:32.120 align:start position:0%
look at those lines that you're talking
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
about and I will get back to the chair
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
of the committee with an answer on that
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.830 --> 04:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
you there stop um thank you um as I look
 
04:05:49.070 --> 04:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
at this um one of the concerns that I
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
have is that um an employer might write
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that looks like a check or a
 
04:05:58.389 --> 04:05:58.399 align:start position:0%
check um we have a lot of uh regulations
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
on banking in the United States to
 
04:06:03.870 --> 04:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that um the the that the money is
 
04:06:08.349 --> 04:06:08.359 align:start position:0%
actually there to um to fulfill the
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
obligations of the person writing the
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
check Etc um
 
04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
so how will you
 
04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
guarantee that if um an employer is
 
04:06:25.750 --> 04:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
paying um paying an employee that it's
 
04:06:28.110 --> 04:06:28.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh something that can be
 
04:06:33.429 --> 04:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
guaranteed and counted upon um by the
 
04:06:36.750 --> 04:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
employee I'm not sure I understand your
 
04:06:38.910 --> 04:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
question I mean you know my
 
04:06:41.309 --> 04:06:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative kill could say okay I
 
04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
have a bank and and just like
 
04:06:46.630 --> 04:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
give people checks and then an employer
 
04:06:49.149 --> 04:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
could write a check on the bank of
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
Cahill but there's no money in the bank
 
04:06:53.349 --> 04:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
of kill that would be up to the
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to enforce that's
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
got nothing to do with how the employer
 
04:07:00.670 --> 04:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
and the employee arrange their payment
 
04:07:05.309 --> 04:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
UPF front Okay thank you representative
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr chair would you
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
believe that due to the fractional
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
Reserve nature of uh the American
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
banking system most of the money in the
 
04:07:17.429 --> 04:07:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
there now you are going down a a very uh
 
04:07:24.349 --> 04:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
all right let's discussion take a long
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
time would you believe Germaine please
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:36.550 --> 04:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
would yeah re McKenzie M Mr chairman I I
 
04:07:37.910 --> 04:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
I expect we're going to hear from the
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor relative yes we are
 
04:07:42.670 --> 04:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh because I think it it it begs an
 
04:07:45.510 --> 04:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
analysis of this section and the impact
 
04:07:47.630 --> 04:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
this is going to have on on workers in
 
04:07:50.510 --> 04:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
general and uh I don't think that the uh
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor is able to answer that he will
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
respond to that guess at some point but

manner in which payment is made shall be

04:08:14.950 --> 04:08:14.960 align:start position:0%

21 page two
 
04:08:23.510 --> 04:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay as you did follow up for followup
 
04:08:24.910 --> 04:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
you have reference status between the
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
employer and the employee wouldn't that
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
be better if it was spelled out
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
clearer than just the employer paying in
 
04:08:32.040 --> 04:08:33.189 align:start position:0%
clearer than just the employer paying in

04:08:36.149 --> 04:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
PS representative avalani anything that
 
04:08:37.990 --> 04:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
you could do or suggest that makes this
 
04:08:40.109 --> 04:08:40.119 align:start position:0%
clear I would be certainly open
 
04:08:49.510 --> 04:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:49.520 --> 04:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
all

04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
all
 
04:08:53.189 --> 04:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
right repres fling again thank you Mr
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
chair I it's not necessarily with this
 
04:08:59.830 --> 04:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
uh Mr representative Tura
 
04:09:02.189 --> 04:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
but it it bothers me because I know all
 
04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
the people here pretty much did
 
04:09:04.319 --> 04:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
the people here pretty much did
representative

04:09:05.670 --> 04:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
de did Linda throw Gino under the
 
04:09:09.439 --> 04:09:11.229 align:start position:0%
de did Linda throw Gino under the
bus

04:09:11.229 --> 04:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
bus
 
04:09:14.590 --> 04:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
what yeah commenting about
 
04:09:17.189 --> 04:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative avalani had something to
 
04:09:19.349 --> 04:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
do with the writing of this
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill no that it it just seemed like you
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat of accusatory tone that it was
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
something that he wanted because he owns
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
his own business and I've owned my own
 
04:09:31.670 --> 04:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
business too no I I did not get that
 
04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
sensing okay I just want to make sure it
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't that's all you okay wasn't taken
 
04:09:39.670 --> 04:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
that way great seeing no other questions
 
04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative appreciate your
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.830 --> 04:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
before you step down representative if
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
if the committee wanted
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
to add as representative avalani said
 
04:09:54.510 --> 04:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
and employer onto that as an amendment
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
that that would work for you just to
 
04:09:58.590 --> 04:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
confirm absolutely as I said before
 
04:10:00.510 --> 04:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
anything that I've worked with
 
04:10:02.189 --> 04:10:02.199 align:start position:0%
representative avalani long enough to
 
04:10:04.030 --> 04:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
know that if he's got a suggestion it's
 
04:10:06.550 --> 04:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
probably a good one okay great thank you
 
04:10:23.469 --> 04:10:23.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.990 --> 04:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon again John
 
04:10:27.109 --> 04:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
garrian uh General counsil Department of
 
04:10:28.870 --> 04:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
Labor and with me is Deputy Commissioner
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert uh the department is
 
04:10:34.830 --> 04:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill as always um uh we
 
04:10:37.429 --> 04:10:37.439 align:start position:0%
do have four technical notes and
 
04:10:39.870 --> 04:10:39.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions as it relates to uh the
 
04:10:42.070 --> 04:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
Department's enforcement of these
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
Provisions um one is just a note which
 
04:10:47.469 --> 04:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
is that typically a department penalty
 
04:10:50.990 --> 04:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
for violation of RSA
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
27543 um like most of our penalties is
 
04:10:57.149 --> 04:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
up to $2,500 per violation um if the
 
04:11:00.149 --> 04:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
violation is for failing to pay in full
 
04:11:03.510 --> 04:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
or on time there is no warning required
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
uh for that however if the violation was
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
going to be for um a failure to say
 
04:11:10.710 --> 04:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
provide this 90day notice of a different
 
04:11:12.670 --> 04:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
payment method um that violation would
 
04:11:15.429 --> 04:11:15.439 align:start position:0%
be subject to a 30-day warning and an
 
04:11:18.670 --> 04:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um correct under our
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
statutes um second uh the statute
 
04:11:22.990 --> 04:11:23.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't or sorry the bill doesn't speak
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
to this uh though the department often
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
enforces uh RSA
 
04:11:29.830 --> 04:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
27549 with that provision says is that
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
employers have to retain certain records
 
04:11:33.229 --> 04:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
and make them available to the
 
04:11:35.070 --> 04:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
department for inspection including
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
amongst great many others records about
 
04:11:40.950 --> 04:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
um wages and hours um and the time and
 
04:11:44.149 --> 04:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
date of of pay and pay periods
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't specifically cover um
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
records pertaining to this notice of
 
04:11:51.670 --> 04:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
payment method that would be a new type
 
04:11:54.030 --> 04:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
of record um if the committee's intent
 
04:11:57.149 --> 04:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
was to have those records um or sorry if
 
04:11:58.510 --> 04:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
the committee's intent was to have do
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
the department to enforce the fact that
 
04:12:02.990 --> 04:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
um employers would retain those records
 
04:12:05.149 --> 04:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
we would have to have a line in RSA
 
04:12:08.149 --> 04:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
27549 to cover that um employers under
 
04:12:09.309 --> 04:12:09.319 align:start position:0%
that statute are required to retain
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
records for up to three
 
04:12:14.189 --> 04:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
years um third uh the department does
 
04:12:14.199 --> 04:12:15.070 align:start position:0%
years um third uh the department does
have

04:12:15.070 --> 04:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
concerns in that this bill um would open
 
04:12:21.790 --> 04:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
up as we've discussed um when it comes
 
04:12:24.149 --> 04:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
to Kangaroo pelts um it would open up
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
kind of non-monetary wage payment either
 
04:12:29.910 --> 04:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
schemes or options that could be in kind
 
04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
payments kind of barter based payments
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
commodity based payments um those those
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
types of payments they're difficult to
 
04:12:40.269 --> 04:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
Value um and they're difficult for the
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
Department to enforce in terms of us
 
04:12:45.309 --> 04:12:45.319 align:start position:0%
enforcing the pay of wages um the values
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
of those could be shifting uh or
 
04:12:51.710 --> 04:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
subjective um it could also lead to uh
 
04:12:52.870 --> 04:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
what we think is kind of increased
 
04:12:56.830 --> 04:12:56.840 align:start position:0%
complaint complaints or claims for wages
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
um as kind of a uh a natural byproduct
 
04:13:01.950 --> 04:13:01.960 align:start position:0%
of this it would have effect on our
 
04:13:04.070 --> 04:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
workers compensation system as well one
 
04:13:06.109 --> 04:13:06.119 align:start position:0%
of the core tenants of that system is we
 
04:13:07.429 --> 04:13:07.439 align:start position:0%
need to figure out what the average
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
weekly wages in order to determine what
 
04:13:12.149 --> 04:13:12.159 align:start position:0%
the benefit payments are um that is all
 
04:13:14.030 --> 04:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
contemplating that wages are are paid in
 
04:13:17.189 --> 04:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
some form of dollarss not uh King group
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
pelts as it were um I don't think you
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
know no insurance car would pay benefits
 
04:13:25.950 --> 04:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
in 60% of your weekly kangaroo pelts um
 
04:13:28.590 --> 04:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
so it would have Downstream effects on a
 
04:13:31.030 --> 04:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
lot of the other functions of the
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
department um finally the bill seems to
 
04:13:36.070 --> 04:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
remove um the kind of specific
 
04:13:38.349 --> 04:13:38.359 align:start position:0%
protections or Provisions about um if
 
04:13:39.710 --> 04:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
you're PID by check that it's got to be
 
04:13:42.469 --> 04:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
drawn on a bank that's convenient to uh
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
the employee
 
04:13:45.469 --> 04:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
or if you're paid in a pay card there's
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of protective elements to how pay
 
04:13:50.030 --> 04:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
cards have to be issued what sort of
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
disclaimers have to be put out there
 
04:13:55.070 --> 04:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
what recourses exist um that would all
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
go away so the department again would
 
04:13:58.349 --> 04:13:58.359 align:start position:0%
would anticipate kind of increased
 
04:14:00.550 --> 04:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
complaints um and increased enforcement
 
04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
efforts I'm happy to take
 
04:14:07.309 --> 04:14:07.319 align:start position:0%
questions counc ring thank you for your
 
04:14:10.269 --> 04:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chair um I heard
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the testimony from representative
 
04:14:14.429 --> 04:14:14.439 align:start position:0%
turkot that uh there's a possibility
 
04:14:16.950 --> 04:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
that it might require by changing it uh
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
that the employee would receive a fee
 
04:14:22.349 --> 04:14:22.359 align:start position:0%
I'm looking here in RSA 275 and it looks
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
like uh further on here in the chapter
 
04:14:26.070 --> 04:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
it basically says that it cannot or
 
04:14:27.630 --> 04:14:27.640 align:start position:0%
employees must be able to receive their
 
04:14:30.510 --> 04:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
pay without a fee um also seeing here in
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
electronics fund transfer and also the
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
also has regulations in the federal
 
04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
level that would not allow for an
 
04:14:43.109 --> 04:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
employer to use a service or a financial
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
thing that would require a fee so I'm
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
curious to see what you know
 
04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
275 how that kind of correlates with
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
what the what it would do here yeah I
 
04:14:53.309 --> 04:14:53.319 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an excellent question I'm
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
not going to comment on the cfpb or
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
their enforcement um there is still a
 
04:15:00.389 --> 04:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
line in the bill uh direct your
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
attention to line seven on the first
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
page of the substantive text that would
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
still require um payment at no cost to
 
04:15:11.149 --> 04:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
the employee Department would take that
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
as at no cost there are other specific
 
04:15:15.990 --> 04:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions in the existing law about um
 
04:15:17.590 --> 04:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
if it's a pay card there's got to be at
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
least one free opportunity to use that
 
04:15:21.910 --> 04:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
pay card because fees on the pay cards
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
can uh they can they can add up or they
 
04:15:27.550 --> 04:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
can um apply in different ways same with
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
the checks my understanding is that the
 
04:15:30.990 --> 04:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
the convenient location of the check is
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
so you're not spending an hour of gas
 
04:15:35.630 --> 04:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
driving to to process a check because
 
04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
that ends up being a cut on the pay okay
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
followup for followup so what would the
 
04:15:43.790 --> 04:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
recourse be If This Were to pass let's
 
04:15:47.229 --> 04:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
say and an employee was charged a fe now
 
04:15:49.149 --> 04:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
to receive their pay what would the
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
recourse be for the Department of Labor
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
uh if we felt there was sufficient
 
04:15:56.229 --> 04:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
evidence that um there was an improper
 
04:15:57.870 --> 04:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
fee charged uh we could bring an
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement action it would be a civil
 
04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
penalty up to
 
04:16:04.269 --> 04:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
$2,500 um if we felt that that uh fee
 
04:16:06.229 --> 04:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
cut into the full amount of the wages we
 
04:16:08.590 --> 04:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
could bring that without warning and the
 
04:16:09.870 --> 04:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
employee themselves could bring a wage
 
04:16:12.550 --> 04:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
claim at the department seeking kind of
 
04:16:15.189 --> 04:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
an a private sense to to seek recompense
 
04:16:17.670 --> 04:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative kill thank
 
04:16:20.349 --> 04:16:20.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr garrian um
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
if the 430 words were you know were
 
04:16:26.469 --> 04:16:26.479 align:start position:0%
removed because this past would some of
 
04:16:29.389 --> 04:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
these changes require you going to rules
 
04:16:32.349 --> 04:16:32.359 align:start position:0%
and would that generate more
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
words I very lik I I couldn't articulate
 
04:16:38.149 --> 04:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
specific rules off the top of my head
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
but um the rules we have a section of
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
rules it's our 800 rules that cover um
 
04:16:45.109 --> 04:16:45.119 align:start position:0%
wage payments likely we would have to
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
look at those pretty carefully to make
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
them align with the statute follow up
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
for followup thank you
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
um what about the burden of converting
 
04:16:57.469 --> 04:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
your kangaroo pelts to cash so that you
 
04:17:00.910 --> 04:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
can buy groceries uh and secondary if
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
you if you do a citation of a civil
 
04:17:04.349 --> 04:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
penalty of
 
04:17:09.189 --> 04:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.510 --> 04:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
pelts the department does not take a
 
04:17:14.229 --> 04:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
position on the market rate of a repel
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly it fluctuates like
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin I can't stand it I have I'm
 
04:17:19.279 --> 04:17:20.269 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin I can't stand it I have I'm
against

04:17:20.269 --> 04:17:20.279 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
it represent McKenzie sir thank you Mr
 
04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you uh hearing today so
 
04:17:30.790 --> 04:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
the language Strikes Out starting at
 
04:17:35.950 --> 04:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
seven uh line 17 and that section deals
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
with collective bargaining agreements
 
04:17:41.269 --> 04:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
and pension trust funds and other
 
04:17:44.790 --> 04:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
agreements and demand for payment for
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
administration um of Health and Welfare
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
and trust funds so I I I'm not I don't
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not able to read very well when I'm
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
listening to the people but does that
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
withraw does that take a whole section
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
of protection out as it relates to the
 
04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
payment of those kinds of things in a
 
04:18:08.149 --> 04:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
timely manner and does it reflect any of
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the agreements that are currently
 
04:18:10.439 --> 04:18:11.510 align:start position:0%
the uh the agreements that are currently
in

04:18:11.510 --> 04:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
place in collected buing agreements and
 
04:18:16.550 --> 04:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
other things like that they're already
 
04:18:19.389 --> 04:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
part of the law and they're protected I
 
04:18:19.399 --> 04:18:20.590 align:start position:0%
part of the law and they're protected I
don't

04:18:20.590 --> 04:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:18:23.149 --> 04:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
understand what the impact was taking
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
that out would be I guess is the
 
04:18:28.030 --> 04:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
question uh yeah the department can't
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
comment on the overall impact that would
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
have on collective bargaining agreements
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's not an area that we that we
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
regulate um but just generally that
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
section I
 
04:18:38.399 --> 04:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
section I
guess

04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
guess
 
04:18:44.429 --> 04:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
I would removing it have impact um it
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
would certainly change the law um in an
 
04:18:50.910 --> 04:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
objective sense uh the Department's more
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
focus on this section and what we tend
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
to focus on in our enforcement efforts
 
04:18:56.990 --> 04:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
when it is usually this kind of the top
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
part of that um of that section which is
 
04:19:01.710 --> 04:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh whether checks that are drawn on
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
financial institutions have been issued
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
um in a convenient manner
 
04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
um to their place of employment we don't
 
04:19:10.870 --> 04:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
we typically don't don't get into the
 
04:19:14.469 --> 04:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining aspects
 
04:19:17.149 --> 04:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
all right and representative Granger
 
04:19:21.149 --> 04:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so the term buck as
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
in one buck that originally referred to
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
when we use deer skins in uh New
 
04:19:29.750 --> 04:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to as an actual unit of trade
 
04:19:31.950 --> 04:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering that extended that
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
covered actually couple several hundred
 
04:19:35.149 --> 04:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
years do you know if the Department of
 
04:19:37.710 --> 04:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
Labor existed back when a buck referred
 
04:19:40.269 --> 04:19:40.279 align:start position:0%
to a literal buck skin okay this is a
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
Germaine question in what way because
 
04:19:44.670 --> 04:19:44.680 align:start position:0%
it's relative to we're talking about
 
04:19:46.349 --> 04:19:46.359 align:start position:0%
kangaroo pelts and whether or not it's
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
okay to use kangaroo pelts as a form of
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
payment and the Department of Labor
 
04:19:52.030 --> 04:19:52.040 align:start position:0%
probably if they existed back then then
 
04:19:54.389 --> 04:19:54.399 align:start position:0%
they would have been regulating such
 
04:19:58.309 --> 04:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
things so this is already let's stay to
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
the written text of the bill please okay
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other questions
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
I I can say the department has existed
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
since 1894 I don't know what the common
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
payment schemes 1994 were thank you are
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
there any other questions yes ma'am
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
chair because I think my question would
 
04:20:23.269 --> 04:20:23.279 align:start position:0%
be about how you enforce things now if I
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
had an issue cashing a check from an
 
04:20:29.950 --> 04:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
employer now I assume I can go to you um
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
and then you help enforce my ability to
 
04:20:36.990 --> 04:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
get paid is how does that if someone has
 
04:20:38.990 --> 04:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
a complaint like that how does do you
 
04:20:41.469 --> 04:20:41.479 align:start position:0%
mind in a brief way explaining what that
 
04:20:45.189 --> 04:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
how that complaint progresses sure yeah
 
04:20:47.790 --> 04:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
um if we receive a complaint like that
 
04:20:50.109 --> 04:20:50.119 align:start position:0%
um we uh our wage or sorry our
 
04:20:52.670 --> 04:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
Inspection Division staff will review it
 
04:20:55.550 --> 04:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and they will uh investigate it and
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
and investigations can involve contact
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
with the employer can involve getting
 
04:21:00.349 --> 04:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
records from the employer to see if this
 
04:21:02.510 --> 04:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
has happened for other employees um
 
04:21:05.830 --> 04:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
involve followup um interviews with that
 
04:21:07.710 --> 04:21:07.720 align:start position:0%
particular employee other employees all
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
those interviews are confidential and
 
04:21:10.630 --> 04:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
protected under the law so that
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
employees can be candid and information
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
they provide uh and ultimately it may
 
04:21:17.109 --> 04:21:17.119 align:start position:0%
result in a proposed civil penalty or an
 
04:21:18.670 --> 04:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement action brought by the
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
department to recover um both the wages
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps uh punitive civil
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
penalties represent Flanigan and then
 
04:21:29.469 --> 04:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie thank you Mr chair
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't even going to bring up
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
beaver pelts but is this a problem not
 
04:21:37.990 --> 04:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
beaver pelts but this whole change of
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
was there a problem in the statute that
 
04:21:42.070 --> 04:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
you were having trouble with or was it
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
just something that people thought it
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
was too busy because I remember years
 
04:21:47.229 --> 04:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
ago dealing with an argument about
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
payroll cards and that's now in statute
 
04:21:52.030 --> 04:21:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're now getting rid of all of that
 
04:21:54.070 --> 04:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and I'm just saying is is this
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
just an opportunity
 
04:22:00.510 --> 04:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
to is it does it improve
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
anything uh I will
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
say um that the department does receive
 
04:22:08.870 --> 04:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh a number of complaints and contacts
 
04:22:11.389 --> 04:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
every year um from people complaining
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
about means and methods of pay payment
 
04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:20.830 --> 04:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
employees okay okay thank you and
 
04:22:23.590 --> 04:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
represent McKenzie thank you uh I'm
 
04:22:26.070 --> 04:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry to kind of stall out on this issue
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
but I I would like to hear some point
 
04:22:33.229 --> 04:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
from you uh as it relates to line 21
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
down to the end because in that section
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
there is a provision for a demand on
 
04:22:41.670 --> 04:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
payment of Pensions and all of those
 
04:22:44.790 --> 04:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
things which gets eliminated from the
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:53.990 --> 04:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
reason so the so I would like to if you
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
could not I don't want to put you on the
 
04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
spot but if you could come back to us
 
04:22:59.309 --> 04:22:59.319 align:start position:0%
with some information as to how that
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
section would be impacted when we decide
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
to take all that out of the way and I
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't expect you to have a
 
04:23:07.630 --> 04:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answer for that right now
 
04:23:11.070 --> 04:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
I I I appreciate that expectation um
 
04:23:11.080 --> 04:23:12.910 align:start position:0%
I I I appreciate that expectation um
that

04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:14.790 --> 04:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an extremely good question
 
04:23:17.030 --> 04:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
it involves a some very interesting and
 
04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
nuanced areas of the law I'm happy to
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
look at that and get you a more comp
 
04:23:22.070 --> 04:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
detailed answer I'm happy to distribute
 
04:23:23.950 --> 04:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
that to I appreciate that that would be
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
great thank
 
04:23:29.109 --> 04:23:29.119 align:start position:0%
you okay sir seeing one more question we
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
will turn it over to representative
 
04:23:33.189 --> 04:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
alalani thank you Mr
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
chairman uh line 21 page two would in
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
your estimation um adding employees
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
after employer so it would be the manner
 
04:23:45.149 --> 04:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
in which imp payment is made shall be
 
04:23:46.830 --> 04:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
determined by the employer and the
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
employee would this section being
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.149 --> 04:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
enforce I think it could reduce
 
04:23:59.790 --> 04:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
some um misunderstandings between
 
04:24:02.590 --> 04:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
employers and employees and reducing
 
04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings um will reduce the
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
number of cases we will need to enforce
 
04:24:08.790 --> 04:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
so that would be a good clarification
 
04:24:10.229 --> 04:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you all
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
right all right sir thank you thank you

04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
it seeing no further pin
 
04:24:26.030 --> 04:24:26.040 align:start position:0%

good afternoon everyone I'd like to open
 
04:31:07.590 --> 04:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing today on HB 487 relative to
 
04:31:10.510 --> 04:31:10.520 align:start position:0%
providing employees with advanced notice
 
04:31:12.990 --> 04:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
of the work schedule
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:24.149 --> 04:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
go thank you um this is somebody else
 
04:31:25.870 --> 04:31:25.880 align:start position:0%

04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
chairman uh one of my constituents so if

the committee thank you for the
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify today in support
 
04:31:37.149 --> 04:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
487 which I've introduced to ensure that
 
04:31:42.109 --> 04:31:42.119 align:start position:0%
hourly employees in New Hampshire
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
receive at least 7 days notice of their
 
04:31:44.880 --> 04:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
receive at least 7 days notice of their
work

04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
schedules again my name is Erica de and
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
I represent the town of Hampton this
 
04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
bill is especially important to
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
residents of Hampton because so many
 
04:31:57.870 --> 04:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
people work in the service industry for
 
04:32:00.670 --> 04:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
many workers especially those in retail
 
04:32:03.750 --> 04:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
food service and other hourly Industries
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
the unpredictability of work schedules
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
is more than just an inconvenience it is
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
a barrier to economic stability and
 
04:32:12.510 --> 04:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
upward Mobility
 
04:32:14.670 --> 04:32:14.680 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire there is no
 
04:32:16.630 --> 04:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
requirement that employers provide
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
advanced notice of work schedules many
 
04:32:21.429 --> 04:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
businesses do the right thing and post
 
04:32:23.910 --> 04:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
schedules in advance but too often
 
04:32:26.030 --> 04:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
workers are left in the dark until days
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
or even just hours before shift begins
 
04:32:31.389 --> 04:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
imagine being a single parent who has to
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
arrange child care but you do not know
 
04:32:36.269 --> 04:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
your hours until the last minute imagine
 
04:32:38.349 --> 04:32:38.359 align:start position:0%
juggling multiple jobs trying to
 
04:32:40.229 --> 04:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
schedule a doctor's appointment or
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking a class to improve your skills
 
04:32:44.670 --> 04:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
and your prospects only to have your
 
04:32:47.030 --> 04:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
shift change unexpectedly and without
 
04:32:49.790 --> 04:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
warning these are not hypotheticals they
 
04:32:51.870 --> 04:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
are the realities faced by thousands of
 
04:32:54.429 --> 04:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire workers every day this is
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
a workers issue and it is also an
 
04:32:56.840 --> 04:32:58.189 align:start position:0%
a workers issue and it is also an
economic

04:32:58.189 --> 04:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
economic
 
04:33:00.910 --> 04:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
issue unpredictable scheduling leads to
 
04:33:03.629 --> 04:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
higher employee turnover lower Workforce
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
participation and greater economic
 
04:33:08.070 --> 04:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
insecurity which ultimately hurt
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
business and our state's economy when
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
workers do not know their sched uals in
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
advance they cannot plan their budgets
 
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
they cannot seek additional work and
 
04:33:18.390 --> 04:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
they cannot fully participate in our
 
04:33:21.551 --> 04:33:21.561 align:start position:0%
economy HB 487 is a balanced and
 
04:33:24.429 --> 04:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
reasonable solution it simply requires
 
04:33:26.551 --> 04:33:26.561 align:start position:0%
that employers provide their hourly
 
04:33:29.070 --> 04:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
employees with at least 7 days notice of
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
their schedule the bill does not apply
 
04:33:33.551 --> 04:33:33.561 align:start position:0%
to businesses with fewer than 15
 
04:33:35.629 --> 04:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
employees and makes exceptions for
 
04:33:37.869 --> 04:33:37.879 align:start position:0%
unforeseen circumstances Beyond an
 
04:33:41.070 --> 04:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
employer's control it also uh opts out
 
04:33:44.269 --> 04:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
the uh medical field um it also this
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
bill protects employees from retaliation
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
from assert for asserting their right to
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
Fair notice I want to be clear that this
 
04:33:54.590 --> 04:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
is not an anti-business bill in fact it
 
04:33:57.150 --> 04:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
is entirely Pro bus when workers have
 
04:33:58.789 --> 04:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
predictable schedules they have more
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
reliable more product they are more
 
04:34:03.551 --> 04:34:03.561 align:start position:0%
reliable more productive and less likely
 
04:34:05.510 --> 04:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
or likely less prone to leaving their
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
jobs reducing hiring and training costs
 
04:34:10.590 --> 04:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
for employers it benefits businesses and
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
employees alike New Hampshire workers
 
04:34:14.109 --> 04:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
should not have to live paycheck to
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
paycheck with no idea when they will
 
04:34:18.390 --> 04:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
work next they should not have to choose
 
04:34:19.949 --> 04:34:19.959 align:start position:0%
between keeping their job and caring for
 
04:34:22.590 --> 04:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
their families HB 47 gives them the
 
04:34:24.830 --> 04:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
basic Dignity of knowing when they are
 
04:34:26.349 --> 04:34:26.359 align:start position:0%
expected to work nothing more and
 
04:34:28.551 --> 04:34:28.561 align:start position:0%
nothing less I urge you to support this
 
04:34:30.789 --> 04:34:30.799 align:start position:0%
Common Sense fair and economically sound
 
04:34:32.590 --> 04:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
measure to bring stability and fairness
 
04:34:35.429 --> 04:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
to our Workforce thank you and I welcome
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
any questions appreciate that thank you
 
04:34:40.070 --> 04:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative lry thank you Mr chair
 
04:34:42.029 --> 04:34:42.039 align:start position:0%
thankk you for taking my question um
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
regarding like seasonal businesses
 
04:34:47.551 --> 04:34:47.561 align:start position:0%
landscapers lifeguards snow plowing
 
04:34:49.670 --> 04:34:49.680 align:start position:0%
operations that would be very difficult
 
04:34:52.670 --> 04:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
to give seven days notice if we don't
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
know when it's going to snow or maybe it
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
rains or does a day off or something how
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
would you square that that's a great
 
04:35:00.269 --> 04:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
question so let's take those one at a
 
04:35:03.189 --> 04:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
time I I heard lifeguards um I I would
 
04:35:04.750 --> 04:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
imagine that they the lifeguards EST
 
04:35:06.789 --> 04:35:06.799 align:start position:0%
State lifeguards right now don't
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
schedule according to the weather but I
 
04:35:11.349 --> 04:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
I don't actually know that I'm happy to
 
04:35:15.310 --> 04:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
find out um regarding
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
lifeguards regarding plowing I would
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
imagine that most of those people are
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
salary positions um but if they are not
 
04:35:24.029 --> 04:35:24.039 align:start position:0%
we could certainly carve out an
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
exception that has to do with weather
 
04:35:28.349 --> 04:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
related issues I'd be happy to consider
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
that as well this is really in intended
 
04:35:34.990 --> 04:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative to Target the industries
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
where there is an element of
 
04:35:37.869 --> 04:35:37.879 align:start position:0%
predictability I'd be happy to carve out
 
04:35:40.949 --> 04:35:40.959 align:start position:0%
an exception for snow related um or
 
04:35:43.390 --> 04:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
weather related emergencies and I think
 
04:35:44.670 --> 04:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
actually there is a provision in the
 
04:35:47.590 --> 04:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
bill that would apply to emergencies and
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
weather probably falls under that
 
04:35:52.510 --> 04:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
category not so much the not so or acts
 
04:35:52.520 --> 04:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
category not so much the not so or acts
of

04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%

legislation there are numerous other
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%

to testify today my name is Elise CAD I
 
04:36:43.150 --> 04:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
move to New Hampshire from Maine in
 
04:36:44.269 --> 04:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
January of
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
2024 thanks I was excited at the
 
04:36:49.949 --> 04:36:49.959 align:start position:0%
possibilities and love living here I
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
have become involved in my community
 
04:36:53.590 --> 04:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
including serving on the wonet high
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
school budget Committee in Hampton I've
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
been working at the same restaurant ever
 
04:37:00.029 --> 04:37:00.039 align:start position:0%
since my move and I like my job I work
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
hard I take pride in what I do and I
 
04:37:04.709 --> 04:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
want to build a stable future for myself
 
04:37:06.510 --> 04:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
however most weeks I don't know my
 
04:37:08.551 --> 04:37:08.561 align:start position:0%
schedule until Sunday evening and I'm
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
frequently called upon to be at work at
 
04:37:12.670 --> 04:37:12.680 align:start position:0%
5:00 a.m. with less than 12 hours of
 
04:37:15.189 --> 04:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
notice because of that I can't schedule
 
04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
medical appointments without the risk of
 
04:37:18.510 --> 04:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
having to cancel at the last minute
 
04:37:20.910 --> 04:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
which is a real problem for me I can't
 
04:37:22.709 --> 04:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
pick up shifts at other restaurants or
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
retail stores to supplement my income I
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
want to work more I want to earn more
 
04:37:29.070 --> 04:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
and I want to build a better future but
 
04:37:30.910 --> 04:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
not knowing my schedule makes picking up
 
04:37:33.310 --> 04:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
extra work exceptionally difficult I
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
would move to another job but this
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
practice of late scheduling is pretty
 
04:37:39.349 --> 04:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
common in the restaurant industry right
 
04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
now we are in an economic environment
 
04:37:44.390 --> 04:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
where it's not easy to get ahead but I'm
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying um I know I'm not alone there are
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
so many other workers like me who want
 
04:37:52.230 --> 04:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
to do more but we are be but we are
 
04:37:54.070 --> 04:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
being held back simply because we don't
 
04:37:57.189 --> 04:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
have the ability to plan if HB 487
 
04:37:59.230 --> 04:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
passes I would finally have the ability
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
to see my schedule a week in advance
 
04:38:03.230 --> 04:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
that means I could schedule medical
 
04:38:04.869 --> 04:38:04.879 align:start position:0%
appointments without stress and I could
 
04:38:07.310 --> 04:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
pick up extra work elsewhere this bill
 
04:38:09.230 --> 04:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
isn't asking for special treatment it's
 
04:38:11.109 --> 04:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
about giving workers like me a fair shot
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
at ability and the opportunity to work
 
04:38:16.551 --> 04:38:16.561 align:start position:0%
um as we can and need to please support
 
04:38:19.150 --> 04:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
HB 487 and give workers like me the
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
ability to plan our lives finances and
 
04:38:24.750 --> 04:38:24.760 align:start position:0%

question I just want to follow up on um
 
04:39:45.670 --> 04:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative Flanigan's question I'm
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
not in this industry so I don't know is
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
this common amongst all restaurants or
 
04:39:51.510 --> 04:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
do you just have a bad
 
04:39:56.030 --> 04:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
employer um I mean as a young that I
 
04:39:57.868 --> 04:39:57.878 align:start position:0%
don't have a bad employer but I mean as
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
a young 20 something most of my friends
 
04:40:03.070 --> 04:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
are also in similar Industries and they
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
all sort of go through the same thing
 
04:40:05.600 --> 04:40:07.990 align:start position:0%
all sort of go through the same thing
so

04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:12.230 --> 04:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir mko thank you Mr chair and
 
04:40:14.750 --> 04:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh if
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
if you go have your shift and you show
 
04:40:19.750 --> 04:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
up and it's kind of a slow night do they
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
do they sometimes tell you to go
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
home um no not in my experience no one's
 
04:40:27.788 --> 04:40:27.798 align:start position:0%
been cut from the shift that's good
 
04:40:31.150 --> 04:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
followup for a followup yes sir uh so if
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
you were otherwise engaged doing
 
04:40:34.868 --> 04:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
something during the day and the boss
 
04:40:37.070 --> 04:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
called and says can you come in tonight
 
04:40:38.628 --> 04:40:38.638 align:start position:0%
if it's good for you you'll come in is
 
04:40:41.470 --> 04:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
that correct um yeah if if I can I mean
 
04:40:43.390 --> 04:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
I want to work as much as possible so
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah one
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
more one more let go for it and and I
 
04:40:49.390 --> 04:40:49.400 align:start position:0%
notice in in in the language in in the
 
04:40:51.948 --> 04:40:51.958 align:start position:0%
bill it seem to cover situations where
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
if the boss needs you needs somebody
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
they can call you and they can't
 
04:40:58.270 --> 04:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
penalize you if you can't make it in
 
04:40:59.868 --> 04:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's that's a reasonable Choice isn't
 
04:41:04.070 --> 04:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:06.590 --> 04:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
you all right and seeing oh one more
 
04:41:08.910 --> 04:41:08.920 align:start position:0%
question there you go just this is a
 
04:41:10.590 --> 04:41:10.600 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward question how many
 
04:41:14.510 --> 04:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
hours a week you work um between 30 and
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%

04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
Carbono if you can state your name and
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
who you represent for the record
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy Sharbino I'm representing
 
04:41:43.680 --> 04:41:46.230 align:start position:0%
my name is Amy Sharbino I'm representing
Continental

04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
Continental
 
04:41:49.150 --> 04:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
Paving many of you have seen me
 
04:41:53.788 --> 04:41:53.798 align:start position:0%
before okay um so I'm here to just we
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill for the strict reason
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
that uh overtime and inconsistent
 
04:42:03.470 --> 04:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
schedules are what we live for um it's a
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
quite a different than the restaurant
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
market and the retail so for any that
 
04:42:09.190 --> 04:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't we're a Paving Company um we
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
employ about 325 employees 98% of them
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
live in New Hampshire um so basically
 
04:42:17.150 --> 04:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
from April to December that's our bread
 
04:42:18.750 --> 04:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
and butter that's when we get most of
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
our work done um our industry as
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
construction as a whole is based on
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
trucks driving on the road large
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
Machinery making materials and the
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
weather so all of those things are
 
04:42:32.788 --> 04:42:32.798 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and not able to be
 
04:42:35.948 --> 04:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
scheduled 7 days out so having to make
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
this schedule and get it out to
 
04:42:38.590 --> 04:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
employees would just it would actually
 
04:42:40.470 --> 04:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to what we do on a daily
 
04:42:42.708 --> 04:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
basis our employees we're just in a
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
different situation but I feel like this
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
would hurt us without intention of doing
 
04:42:49.230 --> 04:42:49.240 align:start position:0%
so so I just wanted to bring that up um
 
04:42:50.830 --> 04:42:50.840 align:start position:0%
whether you carve out construction or
 
04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
something like that that's fine we don't
 
04:42:52.948 --> 04:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
have anything against what they're
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
trying to do but as far as what it does
 
04:42:56.830 --> 04:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
to our industry it I can speak for the
 
04:42:58.310 --> 04:42:58.320 align:start position:0%
entire industry we've talked about it at
 
04:43:01.470 --> 04:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
ACCC it would it would crush us um
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
schedules change on a daily basis as far
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
as when work's getting done the weather
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
changes on a daily basis a machine can
 
04:43:08.310 --> 04:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
break and you can work longer than
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to just there are so
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
many moving parts literally in what we
 
04:43:15.070 --> 04:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
do that it would be impossible and our
 
04:43:16.990 --> 04:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
our people don't I can speak for them
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have a problem with what
 
04:43:20.230 --> 04:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're not assigning on like
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
a they know they're coming in Monday
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
through Friday they just don't have like
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
exact hours that they're supposed to be
 
04:43:26.670 --> 04:43:26.680 align:start position:0%
working that the schedule were supposed
 
04:43:29.230 --> 04:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
to be posting for them so it's a totally
 
04:43:31.230 --> 04:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
different animal but I do feel that one
 
04:43:33.390 --> 04:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
thing would impact the other um and it
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
would impact us
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
negatively okay thank you for that
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
testimony representative
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
kill thank you for taking my question
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh yes so I understand the
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
volatility you know weather and all
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
these other things but and and I guess
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
we could try to carve out uh snow
 
04:43:52.470 --> 04:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
plowing and and weather other related
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
things but isn't it also the case that
 
04:43:57.990 --> 04:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
because your employees understand why
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
why you might cancel a day or why you're
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
starting this day instead of that day
 
04:44:03.628 --> 04:44:03.638 align:start position:0%
that they're not likely to call the
 
04:44:06.910 --> 04:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
labor department and file a complaint I
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't disagree with you and you're
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
telling me that today but imagine my
 
04:44:11.550 --> 04:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
business in 20 years when you're not
 
04:44:13.190 --> 04:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
here to say this is how we interpreted
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
it I I feel like that you know I mean
 
04:44:16.110 --> 04:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
like it's in writing and it's there
 
04:44:17.868 --> 04:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
forever so it's not something just
 
04:44:20.310 --> 04:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
because everybody here today says yeah
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
we think you're fine it doesn't mean
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
that it's not going to bite me down the
 
04:44:25.150 --> 04:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
road kind that's that's what I that's
 
04:44:27.310 --> 04:44:27.320 align:start position:0%
what I fear with legislation sometimes
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's the intent is I agree with you the
 
04:44:32.030 --> 04:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
intent is not us but to be interpreted
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
in court One Day by the labor board but
 
04:44:34.718 --> 04:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
in court One Day by the labor board but
but

04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
basically yes so I just want to add that
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
the labor department U is compl
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
complaint based if nobody complains they
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't go and show up at your door and
 
04:44:47.948 --> 04:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
say why aren't you why does you not work
 
04:44:49.948 --> 04:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
today what's your C what's your schedule
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
if the law requires me to provide a
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
schedule seven days ahead of time there
 
04:44:56.470 --> 04:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
will be somebody that will like it will
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
happen it's paperwork that we have to do
 
04:45:00.910 --> 04:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
for but it's another person I would have
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
to employ to basically saying post this
 
04:45:05.708 --> 04:45:05.718 align:start position:0%
and provide schedule s days ahead of
 
04:45:07.750 --> 04:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
time I that's it's a person I would have
 
04:45:09.670 --> 04:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
to employ as a company to be able to do
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
that to everybody to be able to post it
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
or email it to them whatever the things
 
04:45:15.788 --> 04:45:15.798 align:start position:0%
were listed and at some point somebody
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
will somebody's wife somebody's
 
04:45:18.990 --> 04:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
girlfriend will that's mad about being
 
04:45:20.990 --> 04:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
fired or whatever will say oh they
 
04:45:22.270 --> 04:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
didn't do this let's go back and get
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
them it's just a it's an unrelated you
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
can't have intent down the road as I
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that okay representative
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr chairman and
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually I know your brother I think
 
04:45:37.470 --> 04:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
better than your father possibly um I
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
race motorcycles oh Chad my cousin yes
 
04:45:42.510 --> 04:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
oh your cousin sorry um there seems to
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
be an underlying on your testimony as it
 
04:45:46.190 --> 04:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
relates to weather I mean you can have
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
equipment that's broken but you know
 
04:45:50.788 --> 04:45:50.798 align:start position:0%
that stove could be broken too um do you
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
think uh if you took weather out of your
 
04:45:55.030 --> 04:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
argument there that might have been e it
 
04:45:57.230 --> 04:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
might be easier for you to to deal with
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
this this type of legislation so I think
 
04:46:00.990 --> 04:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
if weather was an exception to the
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
schedule being incorrect I would still
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
based on the way it's written or the way
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
I understand it I would still have to
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
provide the schedule every week to 325
 
04:46:10.670 --> 04:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
people and then the weather would only
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
have the ability to say oh the schedule
 
04:46:14.550 --> 04:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
was wrong but I would still have to
 
04:46:16.350 --> 04:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
provide that schedule which is what we
 
04:46:18.990 --> 04:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't do now we and why do we need to do
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
that I guess would be my question that's
 
04:46:22.590 --> 04:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's my objection to the whole thing
 
04:46:25.510 --> 04:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
for followup sir just a quick one you
 
04:46:27.750 --> 04:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
guys are busy we're busy like crazy so
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
so that means that if you're not at one
 
04:46:31.070 --> 04:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
job you could be at another job correct
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
correct or if you finish one early you
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
may make it to job to and you may work
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
two hours later than your schedule said
 
04:46:37.590 --> 04:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
but everybody wants to do that they want
 
04:46:39.548 --> 04:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
their overtime right I'm just I guess
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is I mean as far as
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
these guys are out running the Machinery
 
04:46:46.030 --> 04:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
you know putting the asphalt down if
 
04:46:47.230 --> 04:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
they're not on one job you can find
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
another job for them to work on they're
 
04:46:50.430 --> 04:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
going to be working for you that week
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
right yeah but does it have to fit in
 
04:46:55.708 --> 04:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
the schedule or if like you have a job
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
you were supposed to do on Tuesday and
 
04:46:59.350 --> 04:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
it rains and then you want to do it on
 
04:47:01.708 --> 04:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
Wednesday like Main Street in nsha so we
 
04:47:03.868 --> 04:47:03.878 align:start position:0%
started that at 2 in the morning just
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
for traffic reasons right but it rains
 
04:47:07.910 --> 04:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday so we push it to Wednesday
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
and you're like hey today tomorrow you
 
04:47:11.310 --> 04:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
got to be here at 2:00 in the morning
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
our our guys are fine with that because
 
04:47:13.788 --> 04:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
they know they were supposed to we tell
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
them it's coming up they know they're
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to do it but that's not what
 
04:47:17.788 --> 04:47:17.798 align:start position:0%
the schedule was seven days ago it's
 
04:47:20.270 --> 04:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
just this fluid system that's always
 
04:47:22.310 --> 04:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
changing in general yes I could say all
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
my guys are working from 6:00 a. to 5:00
 
04:47:27.750 --> 04:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
pm Monday through Friday but I you're
 
04:47:29.350 --> 04:47:29.360 align:start position:0%
the way it's written I still have to
 
04:47:31.350 --> 04:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
provide them with that written schedule
 
04:47:33.470 --> 04:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
seven days ahead of time guessing what
 
04:47:35.548 --> 04:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
hours they're working which 90% of the
 
04:47:37.230 --> 04:47:37.240 align:start position:0%
time is going to be somehow
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
wrong it's providing all this paperwork
 
04:47:42.750 --> 04:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
ahead of time like what is how that
 
04:47:44.590 --> 04:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
would just be it's just another employee
 
04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
it's more costs it's yeah well and
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry go represent
 
04:47:52.590 --> 04:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
Flanigan no no I'm just I mean and and I
 
04:47:54.750 --> 04:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to Discount the laborers okay
 
04:47:56.510 --> 04:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
they do a vital job they do a great job
 
04:47:58.390 --> 04:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but I'm just saying is if it's not
 
04:48:00.150 --> 04:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
raining they're going to lay a pavement
 
04:48:01.910 --> 04:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
down right that's what I'm trying to say
 
04:48:04.110 --> 04:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
we're just working right exactly so so
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
you say to you say to your employee U Mr
 
04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
Drago here you need to be here on this
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
week and work on this job but if you get
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
done early I want you over to the
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
nashille job because it's a bigger job
 
04:48:17.750 --> 04:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
100% yes so other than the weather he's
 
04:48:19.708 --> 04:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
going to be there for seven days or
 
04:48:23.670 --> 04:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the number of days out on a
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
schedule yes but the the the start time
 
04:48:28.390 --> 04:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
May waver by a half hour their end time
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
could waiver by one or two
 
04:48:33.270 --> 04:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
hours all right represent
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you um coming in front of
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
the committee appreciate it and I
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
realized that you're Rough and Tumble
 
04:48:43.788 --> 04:48:43.798 align:start position:0%
business bu uh but let me we heard
 
04:48:46.510 --> 04:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier from uh from people
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
who are trying to manage their lives um
 
04:48:54.070 --> 04:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's important um so how
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
do you accommodate that in uh in your
 
04:48:58.990 --> 04:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
business when people need to take care
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
of children they need to go to medical
 
04:49:04.990 --> 04:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
appointments and so is it is it so it's
 
04:49:07.830 --> 04:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
your position that's untenable to give
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
people a schedule in your business is
 
04:49:10.000 --> 04:49:11.230 align:start position:0%
people a schedule in your business is
untenable

04:49:11.230 --> 04:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
untenable
 
04:49:13.390 --> 04:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
so people don't have the space to be
 
04:49:15.150 --> 04:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
able to do those kinds of things because
 
04:49:16.750 --> 04:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
the schedule changes all the time is
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
that your position no I I most of the
 
04:49:20.150 --> 04:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
time I'll have like just say for
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
instance a truck driver they come in
 
04:49:23.868 --> 04:49:23.878 align:start position:0%
every single morning to my cousin and I
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
and one will be like hey tomorrow I have
 
04:49:27.708 --> 04:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
a dock appointment at 9 o' we say okay
 
04:49:30.190 --> 04:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
and they go they either come in later or
 
04:49:32.548 --> 04:49:32.558 align:start position:0%
come in after or it's just easy we
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
manage it within our company very well I
 
04:49:36.230 --> 04:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
not I don't think any of my employees
 
04:49:38.910 --> 04:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
would say they can't do they don't take
 
04:49:40.430 --> 04:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
vacation in the middle of the summer
 
04:49:42.070 --> 04:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes because we're they get their
 
04:49:44.190 --> 04:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
Winters off but I mean as far as making
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
a doctor's appointment or picking up a
 
04:49:48.150 --> 04:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
sick kid or you know it's got to be
 
04:49:50.190 --> 04:49:50.200 align:start position:0%
within the lines of what you actually
 
04:49:52.110 --> 04:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
need to leave work for but I would say
 
04:49:53.990 --> 04:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
all of them would say it's very possible
 
04:49:55.990 --> 04:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
for a
 
04:49:58.990 --> 04:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
followup but the idea that that somebody
 
04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't know ahead of time yeah what
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
their schedule is going to be I mean I
 
04:50:06.470 --> 04:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't work like that well my guys
 
04:50:08.510 --> 04:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
know they're working Monday through
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
Friday from about 5 or 6: a.m. to about
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
4: to 6 7
 
04:50:17.430 --> 04:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
p.m. you know and then when we switch to
 
04:50:19.788 --> 04:50:19.798 align:start position:0%
nights for the do like you know we have
 
04:50:22.350 --> 04:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
a whole list we tell them we we give a
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
form of a schedule to people but it's
 
04:50:26.868 --> 04:50:26.878 align:start position:0%
not a written schedule every seven days
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
on repeat so basically our guys are on
 
04:50:31.548 --> 04:50:31.558 align:start position:0%
repeat Monday through Friday unless we
 
04:50:33.390 --> 04:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
tell them differently which we let them
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
know but we're still not emailing it to
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
them posting it like that that's my
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
issue with the whole thing is the amount
 
04:50:41.190 --> 04:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
of it's clerical work and we're not
 
04:50:42.788 --> 04:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
we're not solving any problems by doing
 
04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
it I guess what I'm trying to
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
explain thank you okay uh represent
 
04:50:48.910 --> 04:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
proud and then represent lab you still
 
04:50:51.830 --> 04:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a question or you good okay um
 
04:50:53.948 --> 04:50:53.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman do you ever have
 
04:50:55.868 --> 04:50:55.878 align:start position:0%
uh unusual seal changes for reasons
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
unrelated to weather maybe equipment
 
04:50:59.990 --> 04:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
breaking down and you have to postpone a
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
job by a day or for example you know
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
supplies come in either earlier later
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
than expected or for example if you
 
04:51:09.948 --> 04:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned D jobs um a tanker catches
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
fire on a highway you need to repave it
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden every day thank you
 
04:51:16.470 --> 04:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
represent Library thank you for the
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:51:19.788 --> 04:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um one thing
 
04:51:21.150 --> 04:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
that really hasn't been touched on here
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
is is sickness and covid and could you
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
speak to how Co ripped through your
 
04:51:28.030 --> 04:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
company and uh back in the day and and
 
04:51:30.350 --> 04:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
forced you to have this massive Matrix
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
of scheduling and one had to cover
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
another shift and it was just I remember
 
04:51:35.868 --> 04:51:35.878 align:start position:0%
talking Mark about this and it was
 
04:51:37.510 --> 04:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
chaotic yeah and keeping people outside
 
04:51:39.310 --> 04:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
and away from each other I mean just
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
Anything Could Happen where giving
 
04:51:42.230 --> 04:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
somebody a schedule ahead of time but I
 
04:51:44.910 --> 04:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
mean specifically Co we bought 20 more
 
04:51:46.750 --> 04:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
trucks and put one less person in every
 
04:51:48.548 --> 04:51:48.558 align:start position:0%
single truck I mean it's just scheduling
 
04:51:50.150 --> 04:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
is that some people leave from home some
 
04:51:51.990 --> 04:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
people come to the shop like we have so
 
04:51:54.590 --> 04:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
many scenarios to reduce travel time get
 
04:51:56.548 --> 04:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
people home quicker do all the things to
 
04:51:58.990 --> 04:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
help like we believe in family so we try
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
not to work Saturdays we try not to work
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
Sundays that's like a policy like that's
 
04:52:05.470 --> 04:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
what we live so we work long days Monday
 
04:52:07.350 --> 04:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
through Friday so that our guys work
 
04:52:08.868 --> 04:52:08.878 align:start position:0%
their butts off Monday through Friday
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
and then on Saturday Sunday they can
 
04:52:11.430 --> 04:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
spend as much time with their family as
 
04:52:13.190 --> 04:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
possible and sometimes we got to work a
 
04:52:15.270 --> 04:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
Sunday night for the dot and that's fine
 
04:52:16.948 --> 04:52:16.958 align:start position:0%
but our goal is for people to be with
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
their families we're we're very
 
04:52:21.868 --> 04:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
amendable to what they possibly need so
 
04:52:23.350 --> 04:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
now you're just you're basically making
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
it more rigid in my opinion and we don't
 
04:52:28.150 --> 04:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
feel it's necessary in our specific
 
04:52:29.788 --> 04:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
industry I'm not saying anybody else's
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
is not but in ours it would hurt more
 
04:52:35.548 --> 04:52:35.558 align:start position:0%
than it would help okay and represent k
 
04:52:37.230 --> 04:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you again for taking
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
my question uh I did hear earlier that
 
04:52:42.310 --> 04:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
you said that your people are working
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
all summer long and they take their then
 
04:52:45.628 --> 04:52:45.638 align:start position:0%
take their vacations in the winter but
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's another bill uh but uh but I
 
04:52:51.390 --> 04:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
agree with you this is not for your
 
04:52:53.270 --> 04:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
industry correct and we should if we
 
04:52:55.030 --> 04:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
carve this out and help the people who
 
04:52:56.788 --> 04:52:56.798 align:start position:0%
are having the problem which is Mr
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
Summers industry we might be able to to
 
04:53:01.310 --> 04:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
do find a way that that works for all
 
04:53:03.948 --> 04:53:03.958 align:start position:0%
sides but I I agree that your your
 
04:53:06.750 --> 04:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
company's doing fine and you know 5 days
 
04:53:08.350 --> 04:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
a week over time doesn't matter what
 
04:53:09.948 --> 04:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
time it is the roads get paved thank you
 
04:53:12.590 --> 04:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
for Paving the roads and uh would you
 
04:53:13.990 --> 04:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
believe I think we could find a way to
 
04:53:15.510 --> 04:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
work make so that you're happy and
 
04:53:17.628 --> 04:53:17.638 align:start position:0%
they're happy that that's all I ask
 
04:53:20.350 --> 04:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
thank you unnecessary like we got to
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
keep our business running we're family
 
04:53:24.548 --> 04:53:24.558 align:start position:0%
we compete with large corporations and
 
04:53:26.230 --> 04:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
we got to keep it tight lean and mean
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
and adding unnecessary fixed cost is not
 
04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
our goal all right thank you so much for
 
04:53:33.788 --> 04:53:33.798 align:start position:0%
your testimony we appreciate it thank
 
04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
please please stay your name and
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
affiliation for the
 
04:53:44.590 --> 04:53:44.600 align:start position:0%
record good afternoon Mr chairman
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:53:46.948 --> 04:53:46.958 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike Summers I'm the
 
04:53:48.430 --> 04:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
president CEO of the New Hampshire logic
 
04:53:49.948 --> 04:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
and Restaurant Association we're here
 
04:53:51.510 --> 04:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to HP
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
487 um where to begin um so this
 
04:53:59.830 --> 04:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
obviously our industry just for for a
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
little bit of clarity our our industry
 
04:54:02.910 --> 04:54:02.920 align:start position:0%
obviously is an industry of flexibility
 
04:54:04.788 --> 04:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
we have to be flexible the business
 
04:54:07.548 --> 04:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
demands within our industry Change Daily
 
04:54:10.548 --> 04:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
hourly um and so what we find is lot of
 
04:54:11.868 --> 04:54:11.878 align:start position:0%
people come to our industry simply
 
04:54:14.150 --> 04:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
because they can work fewer hours make
 
04:54:15.670 --> 04:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
great money and still have that
 
04:54:18.510 --> 04:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility of schedule and uh well I
 
04:54:20.110 --> 04:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate the uh the
 
04:54:22.470 --> 04:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
frustrations voiced by in earlier
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
testimony I would also say that you know
 
04:54:26.750 --> 04:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
when I worked in in those positions in
 
04:54:28.628 --> 04:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
the industry you have to be an advocate
 
04:54:30.708 --> 04:54:30.718 align:start position:0%
for yourself you have to request time
 
04:54:31.948 --> 04:54:31.958 align:start position:0%
off in advance and I don't know about
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
you guys but I can't get a doctor's
 
04:54:34.910 --> 04:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
appointment inside of three months
 
04:54:37.110 --> 04:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
anyway um so I think it's a case of
 
04:54:38.830 --> 04:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
being more proactive and making sure
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
you're requesting the time off in ADV
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
and I have yet to find a business in our
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
industry that doesn't have some sort of
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
a request time off process where people
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
can get the time off to go to doctor's
 
04:54:49.590 --> 04:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
appointments get an oil change whatever
 
04:54:52.030 --> 04:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
it might be so flexibility is incred
 
04:54:54.190 --> 04:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
incredibly important to our industry I
 
04:54:56.670 --> 04:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
would also say that our IND our business
 
04:54:59.510 --> 04:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
um needs will change legitimately daily
 
04:55:01.430 --> 04:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
hourly Etc and I take for a couple of
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
examples seasonally we have businesses
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
up in the north country that will have a
 
04:55:06.590 --> 04:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
busload of tourists will show up on
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
their front door at 11:55 on a Thursday
 
04:55:12.110 --> 04:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
unannounced no idea so they're working
 
04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
the phones and they're finding people
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
Etc how do you schedule for that I I
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know that you can um you
 
04:55:19.910 --> 04:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
know and and just in a local restaurant
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we pick up uh large parties and
 
04:55:24.190 --> 04:55:24.200 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things on a regular basis
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
and so you can legitimately have
 
04:55:27.708 --> 04:55:27.718 align:start position:0%
somebody call you the day before or two
 
04:55:29.910 --> 04:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
days before with a party of 30 people
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to come in for a wake or
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be these kinds of
 
04:55:34.590 --> 04:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
things again our industry is where
 
04:55:36.868 --> 04:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
people celebrate and they commiserate
 
04:55:38.670 --> 04:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
and uh they have all of those big life
 
04:55:40.510 --> 04:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
experiences happen in our businesses and
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
frankly uh we have to be a flexible
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
industry in order to accommodate those
 
04:55:49.948 --> 04:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
needs um one thing I would also point to
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
in the bill line 6A uh where it says
 
04:55:54.948 --> 04:55:54.958 align:start position:0%
would not allow for a schedule it it
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
basically says that it has to be through
 
04:55:58.910 --> 04:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
email or uh physically handed to them or
 
04:56:01.350 --> 04:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
posted somewhere um most businesses that
 
04:56:02.788 --> 04:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of now they don't even use
 
04:56:04.628 --> 04:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
that it's an app you log into the app
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
and the app has your schedule on it and
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
you can switch shifts and you can do
 
04:56:09.868 --> 04:56:09.878 align:start position:0%
whatever you want right in the app so if
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
this does move forward that I think
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed because frankly
 
04:56:15.190 --> 04:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
the industry is changing the way that it
 
04:56:17.708 --> 04:56:17.718 align:start position:0%
it uh interacts with its
 
04:56:19.868 --> 04:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
employees um but I think ultimately what
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
this does is it creates again more of a
 
04:56:23.548 --> 04:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
burden on the business owners to to be
 
04:56:26.310 --> 04:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
able to uh schedule this keep records of
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
those schedules um you know and other
 
04:56:30.430 --> 04:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
things that I'm I'm not clear on in this
 
04:56:33.150 --> 04:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
bill is if we have posted a schedule uh
 
04:56:34.548 --> 04:56:34.558 align:start position:0%
what's the look back period when the
 
04:56:35.868 --> 04:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor comes knocking on
 
04:56:37.390 --> 04:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
our door because we have a disgruntled
 
04:56:38.990 --> 04:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
employee that's filed a complaint for
 
04:56:41.310 --> 04:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
something unrelated um these are the
 
04:56:42.708 --> 04:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
things the gotcha moments that
 
04:56:44.510 --> 04:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
businesses just cringe when we create
 
04:56:48.030 --> 04:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
these kinds of pieces of legislation so
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
um I won't belabor the point but I will
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
I will with that I'll close and just ask
 
04:56:53.708 --> 04:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
that you find this inexpedient to
 
04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
legislate happy to try to answer any
 
04:56:56.868 --> 04:56:56.878 align:start position:0%
questions all right turn thank you for
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony representative
 
04:57:01.150 --> 04:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:57:03.230 --> 04:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
Mr Summers for being here uh lines 15
 
04:57:03.240 --> 04:57:03.990 align:start position:0%
Mr Summers for being here uh lines 15
and

04:57:03.990 --> 04:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:57:06.230 --> 04:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
16 and I'll just relate it to the party
 
04:57:08.110 --> 04:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
attorney that walks in with an hour's
 
04:57:10.990 --> 04:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
notice um if you call an employee
 
04:57:13.708 --> 04:57:13.718 align:start position:0%
to come in and they say no I don't have
 
04:57:15.628 --> 04:57:15.638 align:start position:0%
to because I wasn't scheduled you have
 
04:57:17.310 --> 04:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
no recourse against that
 
04:57:19.708 --> 04:57:19.718 align:start position:0%
employee well sure but I mean let's face
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
it in today's uh hiring environment
 
04:57:23.310 --> 04:57:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're not going to necessarily punish
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
an employee that can't make it in
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
because they have their child at home or
 
04:57:28.270 --> 04:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
whatever reason that's not going to
 
04:57:30.470 --> 04:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
happen um never has happened and I was
 
04:57:31.830 --> 04:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
in the industry for years and years and
 
04:57:34.510 --> 04:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
years so um I think it's a case of you
 
04:57:36.270 --> 04:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
know as well as I do there's a tree you
 
04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
just call everybody on the list until
 
04:57:40.270 --> 04:57:40.280 align:start position:0%
you find the body that can come in but I
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
would I would say that that to my
 
04:57:42.948 --> 04:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge it has never happened where
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
you would have some sort of retaliatory
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
action because somebody couldn't come in
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
with no notice I just I've never seen
 
04:57:50.190 --> 04:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
that happened thank you you need the
 
04:57:52.628 --> 04:57:52.638 align:start position:0%
staff more than you need to retaliate
 
04:57:56.030 --> 04:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
okay repres K thank you Mr chairman
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Summers uh it seems to me
 
04:58:01.470 --> 04:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
that there's some flexibility here in
 
04:58:01.480 --> 04:58:03.788 align:start position:0%
that there's some flexibility here in
lines

04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:58:08.628 --> 04:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh in lines uh 12 through 14 where if
 
04:58:10.510 --> 04:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
something happens a party of thir 30
 
04:58:12.510 --> 04:58:12.520 align:start position:0%
people show up you can call people on
 
04:58:14.830 --> 04:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
that tree until you get somebody to come
 
04:58:16.270 --> 04:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
in and and who's going to make some
 
04:58:18.548 --> 04:58:18.558 align:start position:0%
money that day
 
04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh and other than that if you know if
 
04:58:23.350 --> 04:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
you think typically during this month of
 
04:58:25.628 --> 04:58:25.638 align:start position:0%
August or that month of September you
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
have different ideas about your your
 
04:58:29.830 --> 04:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
scheduling what you anticipate you would
 
04:58:31.948 --> 04:58:31.958 align:start position:0%
hire the people that you need to staff
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
and let them know a week ahead and that
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
would probably work and then you have
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
the option to oops here's here's a bus
 
04:58:42.030 --> 04:58:42.040 align:start position:0%
get get some people in is is that not
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
workable at
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
all frankly I don't think so because
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're requiring us to post the schedule
 
04:58:50.190 --> 04:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
7 days in advance we may pick up the
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
party two days before the scheduled work
 
04:58:54.510 --> 04:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
week that you posted the schedule May
 
04:58:57.190 --> 04:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
start um so you know again some of our
 
04:58:58.548 --> 04:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
business environment stuff happens
 
04:59:00.868 --> 04:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
within 24 to 48 hours of when a schedule
 
04:59:02.990 --> 04:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be posted so you know in a lot of
 
04:59:04.750 --> 04:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
ways in many restaurants whilst they
 
04:59:07.150 --> 04:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
post a schedule it's kind of a rolling
 
04:59:09.030 --> 04:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
schedule the thing is continually
 
04:59:09.040 --> 04:59:10.708 align:start position:0%
schedule the thing is continually
changing

04:59:10.708 --> 04:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
changing
 
04:59:13.948 --> 04:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah yes sir for followup
 
04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh but again you schedule
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
would it be I don't know if it would be
 
04:59:19.750 --> 04:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
easier if it was five days ahead of time
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
but the bill says seven but if you post
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
that schedule and then something happens
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
you can go to that the phone tree or or
 
04:59:30.510 --> 04:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
your text text or app and you know
 
04:59:31.948 --> 04:59:31.958 align:start position:0%
summon the people the ones who get there
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
first get the
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
money let me provide another example so
 
04:59:38.190 --> 04:59:38.200 align:start position:0%
if you're in a diner situation right and
 
04:59:40.230 --> 04:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
you're only open for breakfast 5 days
 
04:59:42.150 --> 04:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
week and everybody in the Dina works
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
every one of those five days what is the
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
requirement to post a schedule everybody
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
everybody works
 
04:59:50.470 --> 04:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
anyway um and you have a lot of
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that this is going to affect
 
04:59:54.030 --> 04:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
because this affects everybody office
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
settings where somebody comes in at 9ine
 
04:59:57.230 --> 04:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
and leaves at five now you are requiring
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
them to post that schedule for every
 
04:59:58.840 --> 05:00:00.110 align:start position:0%
them to post that schedule for every
single

05:00:00.110 --> 05:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
single
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
company one call yes please uh I don't
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
know if we could tailor this bill so it
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
aims at the the main target which is
 
05:00:11.030 --> 05:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
appears to be the restaurant trade
 
05:00:13.590 --> 05:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
there may be other there may be other
 
05:00:16.510 --> 05:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
Industries where it is retail I'm not
 
05:00:19.350 --> 05:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
sure uh but that would be I guess if we
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
were targeting this group in said you
 
05:00:22.948 --> 05:00:22.958 align:start position:0%
know only this group whereas if we say
 
05:00:24.948 --> 05:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
not the paving people but only the
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
restaurants it gets a little murky but
 
05:00:29.350 --> 05:00:29.360 align:start position:0%
there's no one siiz fits all so we can't
 
05:00:29.360 --> 05:00:31.150 align:start position:0%
there's no one siiz fits all so we can't
do

05:00:31.150 --> 05:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
anything if you want to carve out the
 
05:00:35.670 --> 05:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
restaurants um you guys can restaurants
 
05:00:38.310 --> 05:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
and hotels we're happy to work with you
 
05:00:40.868 --> 05:00:40.878 align:start position:0%
I understand thank you
 
05:00:43.910 --> 05:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
stop thank you I you know I think the
 
05:00:47.430 --> 05:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
the issue is say somebody has
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
traditionally worked on Tuesday
 
05:00:53.548 --> 05:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday and then
 
05:00:56.190 --> 05:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
suddenly the day before they're supposed
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
to work they find out that they have to
 
05:00:59.830 --> 05:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
work on Monday because the schedule
 
05:01:02.628 --> 05:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
changed and they don't have child care
 
05:01:04.990 --> 05:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
or they had they were they were taking
 
05:01:06.788 --> 05:01:06.798 align:start position:0%
their mother to the doctor or something
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's the issue that we're
 
05:01:10.990 --> 05:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
trying to deal with here um that you
 
05:01:13.628 --> 05:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
know if people have a regular schedule
 
05:01:15.750 --> 05:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
then then that's one thing but you know
 
05:01:17.270 --> 05:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
if somebody is
 
05:01:20.510 --> 05:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
working has been working Tuesday um
 
05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
Thursday and Friday and then suddenly
 
05:01:23.910 --> 05:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
they find out that they're working
 
05:01:26.270 --> 05:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
Monday and Wednesday and that messes up
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
all their child care do you have um an
 
05:01:31.750 --> 05:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
idea of how that might be addressed for
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
the most part it's an open discussion
 
05:01:35.670 --> 05:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee um
 
05:01:38.310 --> 05:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know most people to your point most
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
people in our industry usually prefer to
 
05:01:42.510 --> 05:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
have a set schedule and they may have
 
05:01:44.750 --> 05:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know Tuesdays and Sundays off or
 
05:01:47.070 --> 05:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be um but sometimes
 
05:01:48.788 --> 05:01:48.798 align:start position:0%
those needs change but usually it's a
 
05:01:50.270 --> 05:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
discussion between the employer and the
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
employee because the employer will then
 
05:01:54.430 --> 05:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
approach an employee say look hey we
 
05:01:55.750 --> 05:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
picked up a large party I need two
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
people that working can you be one of
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
the two people that is usually the way
 
05:02:00.910 --> 05:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's handled that it's historically been
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
handled um again I'm not suggesting that
 
05:02:05.270 --> 05:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
all operators operate that way but I
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
would suggest that the majority of them
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
operate operate that way but really I
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
think this bill does is now is inserting
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
the government in between the employer
 
05:02:16.150 --> 05:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
employee relationship which for the most
 
05:02:17.430 --> 05:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
part in our industry is a pretty
 
05:02:18.910 --> 05:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort right we're trying
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
to serve our customers we're all trying
 
05:02:23.070 --> 05:02:23.080 align:start position:0%
to make a little money and in many ways
 
05:02:24.510 --> 05:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant employees act as kind of
 
05:02:26.750 --> 05:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
independent contractors in a
 
05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
way repr proud thank you Mr chairman
 
05:02:34.190 --> 05:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
um if you if a restaurant say has two
 
05:02:35.788 --> 05:02:35.798 align:start position:0%
employees one that pretty much always
 
05:02:37.628 --> 05:02:37.638 align:start position:0%
says yes to a last minute shift request
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
and when a party of 5050 shows up
 
05:02:41.230 --> 05:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
unexpected or something and another one
 
05:02:44.150 --> 05:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
that always said almost always says no
 
05:02:45.510 --> 05:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
do you think under this bill which
 
05:02:47.510 --> 05:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
prohibits retaliation an employer would
 
05:02:49.270 --> 05:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
have to be worried about the fact that
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
they always call the yes employee first
 
05:02:53.310 --> 05:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
and get into that habit could be
 
05:02:54.910 --> 05:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
considered retaliation against the no
 
05:02:57.150 --> 05:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
employee where they might have said yes
 
05:02:58.670 --> 05:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
that time and it's retaliation they
 
05:03:00.990 --> 05:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
weren't asked I mean you could certainly
 
05:03:02.910 --> 05:03:02.920 align:start position:0%
make that case yes but I think what you
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
would also find is that the employee
 
05:03:05.910 --> 05:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
that always said yes made a heck of a
 
05:03:07.150 --> 05:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
lot more money than the employee always
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
said no right and so but but the
 
05:03:10.628 --> 05:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
employee who said no may have a very
 
05:03:12.350 --> 05:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason may have child care
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
issues whatever it might be but again
 
05:03:15.670 --> 05:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
that's where our industry has been an
 
05:03:17.310 --> 05:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
industry of flexibility which is why
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
people work in our industry is for that
 
05:03:22.070 --> 05:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
flexibility represent Castel
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chair uh again going
 
05:03:26.430 --> 05:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
with the portal looking at some of the
 
05:03:27.910 --> 05:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
questions in there there was one about
 
05:03:29.868 --> 05:03:29.878 align:start position:0%
predictive scheduling laws that happened
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
in other states I'm sure you're familiar
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
with them or heard of them could you
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
give us a little this essentially is a
 
05:03:36.788 --> 05:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
predictive scheduling law yes okay I
 
05:03:38.270 --> 05:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
also saw in the portal that six other
 
05:03:40.190 --> 05:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
states have repealed those laws or made
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
laws to stop it from happening so I
 
05:03:44.910 --> 05:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
guess because it was only specifically
 
05:03:46.590 --> 05:03:46.600 align:start position:0%
the retail and restaurant industry so my
 
05:03:48.788 --> 05:03:48.798 align:start position:0%
question to you is what do you think
 
05:03:50.868 --> 05:03:50.878 align:start position:0%
that would change in New Hampshire by
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
this because like you said this is the
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
predictive scheduling you know law again
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
I think it becomes a huge issue
 
05:03:59.190 --> 05:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
particularly for those service
 
05:04:01.230 --> 05:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
Industries like the uh the restaurant
 
05:04:03.470 --> 05:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
industry the hotel industry the retail
 
05:04:05.910 --> 05:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
industry Etc because you're now another
 
05:04:08.470 --> 05:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
requirement another gotcha moment um and
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
another reason for employees to create a
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
complaint with the Department of Labor
 
05:04:14.670 --> 05:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
and so this just becomes much more of an
 
05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
an antagonistic relationship between the
 
05:04:18.470 --> 05:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
employee and employer which I think most
 
05:04:22.190 --> 05:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:30.510 --> 05:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
McKenzie when people come to work uh I
 
05:04:33.190 --> 05:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
notice in many restaurants halfway
 
05:04:34.628 --> 05:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
through the night they're
 
05:04:34.638 --> 05:04:36.750 align:start position:0%
through the night they're
gone

05:04:36.750 --> 05:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
gone
 
05:04:40.030 --> 05:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
so what's that practice what what do you
 
05:04:42.590 --> 05:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
how does that work you love to ask me
 
05:04:45.310 --> 05:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
the operational questions so I will say
 
05:04:47.030 --> 05:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the way most restaurants work and
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
depending on size of operation time a
 
05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
day that kind of thing but usually you
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
have an opening shift so say you have a
 
05:04:55.350 --> 05:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
your total Flor coverage is eight
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
servers three or four of them would come
 
05:04:58.708 --> 05:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
in in the first part of the shift they
 
05:04:59.868 --> 05:04:59.878 align:start position:0%
do the opening side work they get
 
05:05:01.868 --> 05:05:01.878 align:start position:0%
everything set up for everybody uh they
 
05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
would work their shift and then when the
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
business starts to die off those four
 
05:05:06.510 --> 05:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
would be the first four to leave because
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
they worked earlier hour or two whatever
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
it might be and then the the three or
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
four or five people that came in later
 
05:05:14.110 --> 05:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
in the shift you know when it starts to
 
05:05:15.628 --> 05:05:15.638 align:start position:0%
get busy they would be the ones that
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
would do the closing side work and they
 
05:05:18.548 --> 05:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
would wrap up at the end of the day so
 
05:05:20.708 --> 05:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
essentially you have this shift scenario
 
05:05:22.868 --> 05:05:22.878 align:start position:0%
is how most restaurants approach
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
it for followup sir
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
so it's safe to say um uh that not only
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
is there no predictability in terms of
 
05:05:36.110 --> 05:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
the schedule that they run but you know
 
05:05:38.708 --> 05:05:38.718 align:start position:0%
the days of the week they work that they
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
actually don't have any
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
predictability uh in terms of how long
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
they'll work during the course of the
 
05:05:44.628 --> 05:05:44.638 align:start position:0%
day because you have the right to send
 
05:05:44.638 --> 05:05:45.470 align:start position:0%
day because you have the right to send
them

05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
home well but you have to understand you
 
05:05:49.788 --> 05:05:49.798 align:start position:0%
know most restaurants you have a period
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
of time which is kind of your Peak
 
05:05:53.670 --> 05:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
period right so if it's if it's for
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
dinner service it's usually probably
 
05:05:57.190 --> 05:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
between 600 and 800 p.m. so that's when
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
we want to have all of the staff on the
 
05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
floor but again I again I will speak for
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
as having been in these positions as a
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
server a bartender and others in in in a
 
05:06:09.390 --> 05:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
past life that you can make an awful lot
 
05:06:12.350 --> 05:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
of money in four or 5 hours um again it
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
just goes back to that's just kind of
 
05:06:15.948 --> 05:06:15.958 align:start position:0%
how it works so that but again as the
 
05:06:17.868 --> 05:06:17.878 align:start position:0%
business you're kind of essentially
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
trying to staff appropriately for the
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
business that you have I mean it would
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
make no sense to have everybody in the
 
05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
business in the that works that day in
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
the establishment from you know 11: in
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
the morning until 11: at night just
 
05:06:33.070 --> 05:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
would make no sense right because
 
05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
between probably 2 and 5:30 in the in
 
05:06:37.030 --> 05:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
the afternoon there's almost nothing
 
05:06:39.750 --> 05:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
going on so that makes no sense and I I
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
think any industry would operate that
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
way all right seeing no further
 
05:06:47.708 --> 05:06:47.718 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir appreciate your
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Miss Albert over to
 
05:06:50.240 --> 05:07:01.390 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Miss Albert over to
you

05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:03.628 --> 05:07:03.638 align:start position:0%
Ma'am good afternoon my name is Daniel
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
Albert I'm the Deputy Commissioner of
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
05:07:08.548 --> 05:07:08.558 align:start position:0%
thank you for having um me here today um
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
I'm here with attorney John garrian
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
general counsel to the department the
 
05:07:13.708 --> 05:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
department has reviewed the language
 
05:07:16.030 --> 05:07:16.040 align:start position:0%
proposed for House Bill uh 487 We
 
05:07:18.110 --> 05:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
believe We Understand um its stated
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose as written we do
 
05:07:22.150 --> 05:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
believe that we can administer it um as
 
05:07:24.470 --> 05:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
written just sort of as a point of a
 
05:07:27.070 --> 05:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
clarification and a technical suggestion
 
05:07:28.830 --> 05:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
um and I believe this was raised uh by
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
some prior testimony currently the
 
05:07:33.670 --> 05:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that are set forth uh as
 
05:07:36.270 --> 05:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
written in the proposed language doesn't
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
specify or give provision relative to
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
how how long or even if an employer
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
should maintain records related to
 
05:07:45.788 --> 05:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
notice um we would suggest perhaps
 
05:07:49.030 --> 05:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
adding language requiring employers to
 
05:07:50.830 --> 05:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
maintain those records um for some
 
05:07:53.230 --> 05:07:53.240 align:start position:0%
period of time could mirror the language
 
05:07:54.990 --> 05:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
that currently exists in
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
27549 which requires uh record
 
05:07:59.190 --> 05:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance of other types for a period
 
05:08:01.510 --> 05:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
of three years um for the purposes of
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrating compliance with the stated
 
05:08:05.628 --> 05:08:05.638 align:start position:0%
requirements should uh the employer have
 
05:08:06.990 --> 05:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
engagement with the Department in the
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
course of a labor audit or other contact
 
05:08:11.350 --> 05:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
from an employee um would assist them in
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
demonstrating compliance with the stated
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
requirements um just a couple of other
 
05:08:17.110 --> 05:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
points based off some of the other
 
05:08:18.830 --> 05:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
testimony there had been some testimony
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
relative to various Industries the
 
05:08:22.948 --> 05:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
department understands the language of
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
this bill to apply to all employers with
 
05:08:26.990 --> 05:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
the exception of those that have fewer
 
05:08:28.830 --> 05:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
than 15 employees in healthcare
 
05:08:31.070 --> 05:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
Industries no other industry is carved
 
05:08:32.830 --> 05:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
out so in the course of regulating it if
 
05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
it were to pass as written um industry
 
05:08:37.910 --> 05:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
specific uh Pro professions are not
 
05:08:38.868 --> 05:08:38.878 align:start position:0%
would not be something that would be
 
05:08:41.070 --> 05:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration the uh stated
 
05:08:42.910 --> 05:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
standards would apply to all of them um
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
and clearly it only applies to hourly
 
05:08:46.110 --> 05:08:46.120 align:start position:0%
employees it's not the scheduling
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
requirements as set forth would not
 
05:08:50.430 --> 05:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
apply uh to salaried employees um just
 
05:08:52.510 --> 05:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
by way of enforcement action were there
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
to be a violation found should this
 
05:08:56.590 --> 05:08:56.600 align:start position:0%
language pass pass and the department
 
05:08:58.390 --> 05:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
undertook a labor investigation what
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
would that potentially look like um a
 
05:09:02.910 --> 05:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
violation of this nature uh should the
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
language pass would be subject to a
 
05:09:07.390 --> 05:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
warning prior to penalty with the 30-day
 
05:09:10.110 --> 05:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
period to cure and I am to take any
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
questions should the committee have any
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:18.350 --> 05:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
sir uh I remember working on a a
 
05:09:21.548 --> 05:09:21.558 align:start position:0%
legislation that dealt with the U 2hour
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
period that the employee has to be paid
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
if they're called into work so in the
 
05:09:28.750 --> 05:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
case of the testimony you
 
05:09:32.990 --> 05:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
heard what constitutes being called into
 
05:09:35.910 --> 05:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
work that's an excellent question I you
 
05:09:37.948 --> 05:09:37.958 align:start position:0%
know the way that the 2hour minimum
 
05:09:39.868 --> 05:09:39.878 align:start position:0%
requirement works if an employ
 
05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
is scheduled physically called um or is
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
coming to work at the request of the
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
employer they arrive and they are um
 
05:09:49.150 --> 05:09:49.160 align:start position:0%
sent home uh bad bad weather tends to be
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
the example in this type of scenario um
 
05:09:53.390 --> 05:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
but are otherwise told nope we don't
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
need you for quite that long they are
 
05:09:56.110 --> 05:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
required with there are certain
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions certain industries are
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
accepted out from this um but they are
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
required to be paid that 2hour minimum
 
05:10:04.590 --> 05:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
so if there were a posted schedule um as
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
required if this language were to pass
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
employee came in they arrived uh because
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
the schedule was posted and there's bad
 
05:10:12.270 --> 05:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
weather or equipment was broken or
 
05:10:14.788 --> 05:10:14.798 align:start position:0%
whatever the nature may be um would the
 
05:10:17.628 --> 05:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
2hour minimum law still apply yes so
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
long as it's not one of those industries
 
05:10:20.590 --> 05:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
that are Exempted out from the two uh
 
05:10:22.190 --> 05:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
two-hour minimum
 
05:10:24.990 --> 05:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for followup thank you and
 
05:10:28.030 --> 05:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
the rate of pay in that case uh would
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
that be
 
05:10:34.548 --> 05:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
um uh 2 32 327 an hour or would it be
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
the full minimum wage it would be the
 
05:10:39.510 --> 05:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
rate of pay that the employee was hired
 
05:10:41.670 --> 05:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
whatever stated that they agreed on at
 
05:10:42.990 --> 05:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
the time of hire but they're not waiting
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
on tables at that point in the in the
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
terms of the service industry you mean
 
05:10:49.910 --> 05:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
or like the food service industry or any
 
05:10:51.390 --> 05:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
indust it would be at the minimum more
 
05:10:53.070 --> 05:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
likely than not at the minimum wage rate
 
05:10:56.708 --> 05:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
thank you right represent
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
Flanigan thank you Mr
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
chairman so the our employers here have
 
05:11:07.030 --> 05:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
to keep those 7 Day lead slips for three
 
05:11:09.390 --> 05:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
years for every employee is what you're
 
05:11:12.030 --> 05:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
saying if this law passed the department
 
05:11:15.708 --> 05:11:15.718 align:start position:0%
would recommend some some document um
 
05:11:17.990 --> 05:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
retention provision to demonstrate
 
05:11:20.030 --> 05:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with the stated requirement
 
05:11:21.830 --> 05:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're simply noting that's currently not
 
05:11:23.590 --> 05:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
outlined in there and we are envisioning
 
05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios where we engage with an
 
05:11:27.990 --> 05:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
employer um either based on a complaint
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
or in the course of a of an audit um and
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
issues related to scheduling came up um
 
05:11:35.110 --> 05:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
in order to demonstrate to the
 
05:11:36.868 --> 05:11:36.878 align:start position:0%
department it's a it's a it's a way to
 
05:11:38.590 --> 05:11:38.600 align:start position:0%
assist Employers in demonstrating to the
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
department that they they've complied
 
05:11:42.030 --> 05:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
with the stated requirements um you know
 
05:11:43.590 --> 05:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it necessarily has to
 
05:11:46.310 --> 05:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
be a copy of the actual schedule um or
 
05:11:48.390 --> 05:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
some other documentation but some sort
 
05:11:51.990 --> 05:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
of documentation retention um is is is
 
05:11:53.708 --> 05:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
something worth considering for
 
05:11:55.590 --> 05:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
compliance reasons so if I and I don't
 
05:11:56.948 --> 05:11:56.958 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth or the
 
05:12:00.190 --> 05:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um so you're you're
 
05:12:02.708 --> 05:12:02.718 align:start position:0%
saying that if the employer shows a
 
05:12:05.670 --> 05:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
consistent behavior in which you could
 
05:12:07.948 --> 05:12:07.958 align:start position:0%
reflect that they've been doing this and
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
complying it could be like a quarterly
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
audit or something that they might do or
 
05:12:13.150 --> 05:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
something that could prove to an
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
investigator that they are in compliance
 
05:12:17.510 --> 05:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
that type of thing or something like
 
05:12:19.948 --> 05:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
that more more likely than not and often
 
05:12:21.350 --> 05:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
times when the Department's engaging
 
05:12:23.628 --> 05:12:23.638 align:start position:0%
with an employer documentation to review
 
05:12:26.310 --> 05:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
is a very helpful thing to have yeah um
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
so again we are anticipating you know
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
engaging with employers should the
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
requirement pass the question will be at
 
05:12:34.750 --> 05:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
some point whether or not a particular
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
employer has complied with the stated
 
05:12:38.270 --> 05:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
requirement and what best way for the
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
employer to demonstrate to the
 
05:12:41.230 --> 05:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
department that they have done so if
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's complaint that they have not
 
05:12:45.830 --> 05:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
05:12:47.628 --> 05:12:47.638 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:12:48.910 --> 05:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so just a
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
clarifying question under the current
 
05:12:52.430 --> 05:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
law is there any provision that allows
 
05:12:55.470 --> 05:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
an employee that would be subjected to
 
05:12:57.708 --> 05:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
bad standards or scheduling that they
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
could come and file a grievance or
 
05:13:00.150 --> 05:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
something like that with the Department
 
05:13:00.160 --> 05:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
something like that with the Department
of

05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
Labor I may have you rephrase the
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
question or or let me make sure I
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
understood it correctly um are you
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
asking whether or not there's a
 
05:13:10.270 --> 05:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism whereby an employee currently
 
05:13:12.110 --> 05:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by scheduling practices can
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
complain to the department yes
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
correct not in the sense there's no
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
current requirement that an employer is
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
required to post like a weekly schedule
 
05:13:25.470 --> 05:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
they are required to notify employees at
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
the time a hire about their rate of pay
 
05:13:30.310 --> 05:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
the date and place um and time that date
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
and date and I think place that payment
 
05:13:36.670 --> 05:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
is going to occur um and those types of
 
05:13:39.470 --> 05:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
things um so there wouldn't currently
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
there's no provision similar to this
 
05:13:43.708 --> 05:13:43.718 align:start position:0%
where if an employee came in and said oh
 
05:13:45.590 --> 05:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
I I was scheduled you know 2 days in
 
05:13:47.150 --> 05:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
advance and I was trying to take time
 
05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
off could could the department um
 
05:13:51.750 --> 05:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
investigate or or assist me with my
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
employer because I think a law has been
 
05:13:55.070 --> 05:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
violated it would not be a law under our
 
05:13:57.910 --> 05:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for a followup so I'm sure
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
you get a lot of complaints but if
 
05:14:01.628 --> 05:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
people complain of an issue like this
 
05:14:03.948 --> 05:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
would there be a recourse not through
 
05:14:05.190 --> 05:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
05:14:07.270 --> 05:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
Labor um I don't know if there's other
 
05:14:09.750 --> 05:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
recourse in some other area um but not
 
05:14:11.070 --> 05:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
currently through the laws that we
 
05:14:14.030 --> 05:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
oversee represent proud thank you Mr
 
05:14:14.040 --> 05:14:15.708 align:start position:0%
oversee represent proud thank you Mr
chairman

05:14:15.708 --> 05:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
um so if this law were to pass and a
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
business that had you know not really a
 
05:14:23.150 --> 05:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
you know weekly schedule published or
 
05:14:24.750 --> 05:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
anything else but basically a standing
 
05:14:26.670 --> 05:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
order that we work Monday through Friday
 
05:14:28.310 --> 05:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
except holidays that are listed on our
 
05:14:30.628 --> 05:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
website would that be enough to comply
 
05:14:32.110 --> 05:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
with this law or would they have to
 
05:14:34.548 --> 05:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
generate new paper work every week
 
05:14:37.510 --> 05:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question as written
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
the language is relative ly specific
 
05:14:43.150 --> 05:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
that the employer is required to provide
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
this notice for its hourly employees um
 
05:14:48.190 --> 05:14:48.200 align:start position:0%
of the work schedule at least seven days
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
in advance of any pay period um seven
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
days in advance certainly could be at a
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
point in time um it's the any pay period
 
05:15:00.548 --> 05:15:00.558 align:start position:0%
provision it doesn't specify every pay
 
05:15:05.030 --> 05:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
period uh so so possibly I that's one I
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
may want to contemplate um just a bit
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps follow up with you on I
 
05:15:11.350 --> 05:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
don't want to give poor guidance um I do
 
05:15:13.470 --> 05:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
think as written there's an there it
 
05:15:15.430 --> 05:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
could arguably con be construed that if
 
05:15:17.150 --> 05:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
there is a set or static schedule you're
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
posting it 7 days in advance of any
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
specified pay period um if it changes uh
 
05:15:25.548 --> 05:15:25.558 align:start position:0%
and I think that's encompassed within
 
05:15:28.110 --> 05:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
provision two that's at 12 lines 12
 
05:15:30.430 --> 05:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
through 14 if it's going to change due
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
to any sort of unforeseen circumstance
 
05:15:33.990 --> 05:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
then there would have to be notice
 
05:15:36.070 --> 05:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
provided as soon as possible I'll note
 
05:15:37.990 --> 05:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
that language is specific to unforeseen
 
05:15:38.000 --> 05:15:39.548 align:start position:0%
that language is specific to unforeseen
circumstances

05:15:39.548 --> 05:15:39.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
05:15:42.070 --> 05:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
um not specifically laid out in the
 
05:15:43.548 --> 05:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
language itself but if there was a
 
05:15:45.430 --> 05:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
planned change uh arguably you would
 
05:15:47.750 --> 05:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
need to repost that notice within seven
 
05:15:50.030 --> 05:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
days of advance of of the specified pay
 
05:15:54.590 --> 05:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
period followup for follow-up sir um
 
05:15:56.310 --> 05:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
again with this hypothetical company if
 
05:15:58.548 --> 05:15:58.558 align:start position:0%
they sent a companywide notification hey
 
05:15:59.948 --> 05:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
facility is closed next week because
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
we're having our air conditioner
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
replaced would that be enough if that
 
05:16:05.110 --> 05:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
was a notice to all employees or would
 
05:16:08.030 --> 05:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
they have to generate schedules times
 
05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
however many the employees employes
 
05:16:11.708 --> 05:16:11.718 align:start position:0%
employees they have specific to that pay
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
period to show hey this day is not in
 
05:16:15.628 --> 05:16:15.638 align:start position:0%
our normal standing order because it's
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
not a holiday and it is a week day but
 
05:16:19.628 --> 05:16:19.638 align:start position:0%
we're closed that
 
05:16:23.230 --> 05:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
day that may depend on how the employer
 
05:16:25.430 --> 05:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
um schedules their employees uh you
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
could send it to all employees it's a
 
05:16:28.670 --> 05:16:28.680 align:start position:0%
singular notice if they all have the
 
05:16:30.510 --> 05:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
same schedules if everybody's schedules
 
05:16:32.590 --> 05:16:32.600 align:start position:0%
are different it may need to be more
 
05:16:35.470 --> 05:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
individualized thank you all right
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
seeing no further oh now seeing one
 
05:16:39.670 --> 05:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
further question
 
05:16:41.548 --> 05:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
repres thank you Mr chairman I'll be
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
brief uh lines 15 and 16 I'll rephrase
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
that question uh for you um if a
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
employee would to call the department
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
and say my employer retaliated against
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
me I usually work three shifts I'm only
 
05:16:56.070 --> 05:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
working two this week because I didn't
 
05:16:58.030 --> 05:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
cover an ex shift last week would that
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
trigger an investigation by or an
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
inquiry by the Department of Labor it's
 
05:17:04.030 --> 05:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
an excellent question it potentially
 
05:17:06.230 --> 05:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
could um you know complaints when they
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
come in they are vetted um they're
 
05:17:12.070 --> 05:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's conversation um with the
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
complainant again protected as it's an a
 
05:17:16.390 --> 05:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
protected employee communication it
 
05:17:18.510 --> 05:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
possibly could whether or not it would
 
05:17:20.910 --> 05:17:20.920 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of a violation um of
 
05:17:22.470 --> 05:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
this provision were it to pass would be
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
very fact specific and dependent upon
 
05:17:25.910 --> 05:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
what was borne out with engagement on
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
the employer but it potentially could R
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know initiate um interaction with
 
05:17:34.190 --> 05:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
the department or a labor audit follow
 
05:17:35.708 --> 05:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
for followup sir would that preclude the
 
05:17:37.270 --> 05:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
employer from having any other things
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
looked at while you're there invest
 
05:17:41.430 --> 05:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
tigating this yeah that's an excellent
 
05:17:44.270 --> 05:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
question so there is a provision in 273
 
05:17:48.110 --> 05:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's provision 9A 9 or 9A uh
 
05:17:51.030 --> 05:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
that details um uh sort of the scope
 
05:17:52.350 --> 05:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
that the Department is supposed to look
 
05:17:54.990 --> 05:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
at we do abide by those requirements um
 
05:17:57.470 --> 05:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
so you know would it be uh the do is
 
05:17:57.480 --> 05:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
so you know would it be uh the do is
completely

05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:18:01.030 --> 05:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
open operating within the confines of
 
05:18:03.470 --> 05:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
those of of the scope requirements um
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
the department would do so so um it not
 
05:18:07.750 --> 05:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
to say that in the course of engaging
 
05:18:09.590 --> 05:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
with the employer if other information
 
05:18:12.070 --> 05:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
were provided indicative that there may
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
be other issues that that would not also
 
05:18:16.628 --> 05:18:16.638 align:start position:0%
be looked at that could be a possibility
 
05:18:19.030 --> 05:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
um but it is not uh it would not um
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
investigations are not approached on a
 
05:18:24.470 --> 05:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
looking for all things uh manner um in
 
05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%

employment during the school year and at
 
05:22:29.830 --> 05:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
night and representative kill uh it's
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%

05:22:33.670 --> 05:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you very much Mr chair yes
 
05:22:36.548 --> 05:22:36.558 align:start position:0%
I am representative Michael kahill from
 
05:22:39.230 --> 05:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
New Market I represent the towns of New
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
Market and newfields and Rockingham 10
 
05:22:45.948 --> 05:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
and 379 addresses uh youth employment
 
05:22:48.868 --> 05:22:48.878 align:start position:0%
during the school year and at night uh
 
05:22:51.150 --> 05:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
in the past we had legislation that
 
05:22:54.948 --> 05:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
covered these topics and uh in a a bit
 
05:22:57.350 --> 05:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
of a frenzy I believe part A B an
 
05:22:59.270 --> 05:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
important section was was
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
repealed and so what I would like to do
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill
 
05:23:07.030 --> 05:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
is uh first of all if you if you're
 
05:23:09.548 --> 05:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
reading the bill you'll see that uh
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
we're I've made note of the fact that um
 
05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
it used to say between June 1 and Labor
 
05:23:19.110 --> 05:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
Day where to that effect and yeah June
 
05:23:20.948 --> 05:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
one in Labor Day and schools don't work
 
05:23:23.110 --> 05:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
that way in New Hampshire anymore uh
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
your kids are often going back uh the
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
last week of August and they leave
 
05:23:32.350 --> 05:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
school sometime in June uh 15th 21st it
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
depends on snow days and other things so
 
05:23:38.070 --> 05:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
it's really when the school begins and
 
05:23:39.470 --> 05:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
when the school ends that's the time
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're talking about that I think that
 
05:23:45.830 --> 05:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
young people 16 to 17 should be wrapping
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%
it up at
 
05:23:49.708 --> 05:23:49.718 align:start position:0%
9:00 and going home and if they haven't
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
got their homework done yet getting to
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
their homework getting a good night's
 
05:23:55.628 --> 05:23:55.638 align:start position:0%
sleep getting in that bus at 6 o' in the
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
morning and getting their education so
 
05:24:00.910 --> 05:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
they can be prepared for what lies ahead
 
05:24:04.270 --> 05:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
of them uh certainly summer jobs are
 
05:24:05.830 --> 05:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
great they can work lots of hours in the
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
summer working after school job I think
 
05:24:10.230 --> 05:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
we've probably done that it's good
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
experience you get a little a little
 
05:24:13.430 --> 05:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
money in your pocket a little practice
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
handling money and you get work
 
05:24:18.030 --> 05:24:18.040 align:start position:0%
experience but you know too much of a
 
05:24:21.350 --> 05:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
good thing uh can be can affect you
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
affect your school performance affect
 
05:24:26.270 --> 05:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
lots of things and uh that's why I
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward and some of
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
felt that the restrictions were too
 
05:24:35.030 --> 05:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
burdensome on the employer and I I I
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
have some of the copies waiting but this
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
this folder
 
05:24:42.430 --> 05:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
this is uh youth labor
 
05:24:45.390 --> 05:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
violations and it's not because the the
 
05:24:47.070 --> 05:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
laws are too burdens them are too
 
05:24:48.708 --> 05:24:48.718 align:start position:0%
difficult it's because of the
 
05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
impunity that employers look at them
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
with and they say well I did it I I had
 
05:24:56.830 --> 05:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
51 ver 51 VI of this kind of violation
 
05:24:59.070 --> 05:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
from the same employer the inspection
 
05:25:01.830 --> 05:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
reports and it doesn't matter because
 
05:25:03.230 --> 05:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know it's a cost of doing business
 
05:25:05.310 --> 05:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
and the other part of this that I I find
 
05:25:08.390 --> 05:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
troubling is that the violations you you
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
know the the fines are vastly
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
discounted so where it should be you
 
05:25:18.910 --> 05:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
05:25:23.190 --> 05:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
$5,100 um brought down to $600 now maybe
 
05:25:25.270 --> 05:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
they have the best lawyer working this
 
05:25:26.708 --> 05:25:26.718 align:start position:0%
or maybe the department is really just
 
05:25:28.670 --> 05:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
trying to go out of the way not to be
 
05:25:31.150 --> 05:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
too hard on businesses but that's quite
 
05:25:34.948 --> 05:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
a discount so I I'm not going to go into
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh that we should probably not discount
 
05:25:39.830 --> 05:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
the fines much I'd like to reduce the
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
violations I think the way the way to
 
05:25:43.830 --> 05:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the violations is not to get rid
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
of the law but to educate and motivate
 
05:25:49.910 --> 05:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
the employers to follow the law and
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
there was law protecting you know 16 to
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
17 year olds who probably need
 
05:25:57.310 --> 05:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
protection from themselves because if
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
you remember you might not have been
 
05:26:00.430 --> 05:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
that smart when you were that age you
 
05:26:01.948 --> 05:26:01.958 align:start position:0%
might have done things that you might
 
05:26:05.510 --> 05:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
might not do now even if you could and
 
05:26:07.390 --> 05:26:07.400 align:start position:0%
uh so we we need to be thinking about
 
05:26:09.948 --> 05:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
this education is important yesterday
 
05:26:11.110 --> 05:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
you may be aware that there was a
 
05:26:13.628 --> 05:26:13.638 align:start position:0%
hearing in rep's Hall I think it was 7
 
05:26:15.750 --> 05:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
hours of people that that came to
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
testify the about the importance of
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
education and a rich and well-rounded
 
05:26:22.628 --> 05:26:22.638 align:start position:0%
education at that and if you want to
 
05:26:26.708 --> 05:26:26.718 align:start position:0%
have your kids uh playing sports uh
 
05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
maybe uh music uh on the com on the
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
robotics team and meeting all their you
 
05:26:35.590 --> 05:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
know their other core subjects I think
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
they need to have a good night's sleep
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
they need to be not wor worried about oh
 
05:26:41.590 --> 05:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
you know if I can I get another shift in
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
so I can uh have that money for that car
 
05:26:46.910 --> 05:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
they they really need to be focusing on
 
05:26:49.190 --> 05:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
their education whether they're going to
 
05:26:52.470 --> 05:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
college or not high school is is a
 
05:26:55.230 --> 05:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
minimum it's a minimum and and uh we
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
need to be able to have those kids at
 
05:26:59.270 --> 05:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
their at the job when it's you know when
 
05:27:01.590 --> 05:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's at the appropriate time in bed or
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
doing their homework at school it's all
 
05:27:09.548 --> 05:27:09.558 align:start position:0%
about balance so that's my testimony
 
05:27:12.628 --> 05:27:12.638 align:start position:0%
and I think that I've spoken to a number
 
05:27:14.868 --> 05:27:14.878 align:start position:0%
of parents of teenage kids and they they
 
05:27:16.948 --> 05:27:16.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want their kids working past
 
05:27:20.350 --> 05:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
9:00 they think it's outrageous and yet
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes the employer will say well you
 
05:27:24.150 --> 05:27:24.160 align:start position:0%
know can you work can you work till 10:
 
05:27:26.190 --> 05:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
can you work till 11: and if the answer
 
05:27:29.310 --> 05:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
is no well next kid and we don't want to
 
05:27:32.708 --> 05:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
deny somebody an opportunity to work and
 
05:27:34.548 --> 05:27:34.558 align:start position:0%
get that experience just because their
 
05:27:37.310 --> 05:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
parents are trying to take to look out
 
05:27:39.868 --> 05:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
for them so this isn't so much about
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
parents' rights this is about the kids
 
05:27:44.310 --> 05:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
rights and the employer right the
 
05:27:46.510 --> 05:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
employer should be able to have the kid
 
05:27:49.310 --> 05:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know there and working their shift
 
05:27:51.510 --> 05:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
leaving coming back and maybe they come
 
05:27:53.470 --> 05:27:53.480 align:start position:0%
back next summer because they liked it
 
05:27:55.190 --> 05:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
so much and they and the school work was
 
05:27:57.948 --> 05:27:57.958 align:start position:0%
up and there's no conflict and uh this
 
05:27:59.548 --> 05:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
is the way it should be working I think
 
05:28:03.788 --> 05:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
9:00 is late enough uh on a school night
 
05:28:06.910 --> 05:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
and 11:00 on the weekend no problem
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
summertime not s out but we should we
 
05:28:14.110 --> 05:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
should reinstate this and uh pass this
 
05:28:16.708 --> 05:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
law okay thank you for introducing this
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation if we can have
 
05:28:18.718 --> 05:28:20.430 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation if we can have
representative

05:28:20.430 --> 05:28:20.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:28:22.708 --> 05:28:22.718 align:start position:0%
ly thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:28:24.910 --> 05:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question does this pertain to
 
05:28:28.310 --> 05:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
a certain sector in the economy is this
 
05:28:31.990 --> 05:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
restaurant is this uh any any because
 
05:28:34.270 --> 05:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
these violations are there are in
 
05:28:36.910 --> 05:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
addition to restaurants and fast food
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
there are municipalities
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
golf courses so
 
05:28:44.590 --> 05:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
it's any once this is I'm afraid to say
 
05:28:47.628 --> 05:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
it one size fits all but you got you got
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
you got your teenagers you want them to
 
05:28:51.430 --> 05:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
work let's have a
 
05:28:53.670 --> 05:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
balance okay thank
 
05:28:56.230 --> 05:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
PR thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
for my question um regarding section two
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
uh does it apply and notice it says days
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
the week fairly statically uh how does
 
05:29:05.030 --> 05:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
this work if there's a holiday if
 
05:29:06.350 --> 05:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
there's a Monday holiday if there's a
 
05:29:08.510 --> 05:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
Friday holiday in the week I mean it
 
05:29:10.030 --> 05:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
seems like that would be a little bit uh
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed and and not quite with the
 
05:29:15.110 --> 05:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the section uh if it
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
applies equally to
 
05:29:19.628 --> 05:29:19.638 align:start position:0%
holidays right
 
05:29:22.190 --> 05:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
um that's that's an interesting point
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
representative and I know that there was
 
05:29:26.628 --> 05:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
an effort previously to include that you
 
05:29:28.910 --> 05:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
know if if there's a Monday the teachers
 
05:29:30.868 --> 05:29:30.878 align:start position:0%
uh work session and why can't they do
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
this that's a little bit hard to to to
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
follow because you know you might have
 
05:29:36.750 --> 05:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
kids from three different high schools
 
05:29:38.590 --> 05:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
and working in your business
 
05:29:38.600 --> 05:29:39.390 align:start position:0%
and working in your business
a

05:29:39.390 --> 05:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:29:41.868 --> 05:29:41.878 align:start position:0%
holiday for a holiday you might have a
 
05:29:44.230 --> 05:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
point and I think that's a reasonable
 
05:29:46.430 --> 05:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment provided that you'll go along
 
05:29:49.190 --> 05:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the bill follow for
 
05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
followup Mr uh again regarding the same
 
05:29:53.070 --> 05:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
section does it apply equally to
 
05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
in-person work and Tork I'm I'm thinking
 
05:29:57.750 --> 05:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
back to my job when I was 16-year- old
 
05:30:00.910 --> 05:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
was a computer programmer and uh if if I
 
05:30:02.708 --> 05:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
was doing that now I would think a lot
 
05:30:04.548 --> 05:30:04.558 align:start position:0%
of it would be over zoom and Tork and
 
05:30:06.110 --> 05:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily in person work like it
 
05:30:08.708 --> 05:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
was back then uh uh thank you for the
 
05:30:10.590 --> 05:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
question I I think it should apply
 
05:30:12.670 --> 05:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
because you're working uh hopefully
 
05:30:16.350 --> 05:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
getting paid I I'm not sure
 
05:30:20.190 --> 05:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
how uh again labor law is the labor law
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
is um they respond to
 
05:30:25.788 --> 05:30:25.798 align:start position:0%
complaints and I don't know where the
 
05:30:28.830 --> 05:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
complaint would originate and you know
 
05:30:30.510 --> 05:30:30.520 align:start position:0%
I'd like to think that your older self
 
05:30:32.670 --> 05:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
would be telling you younger self you
 
05:30:34.670 --> 05:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
maybe this is too much and I should get
 
05:30:37.150 --> 05:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
some sleep and and all that but I'm not
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
sure that would happen and so uh again
 
05:30:41.830 --> 05:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
that that some of those people who are
 
05:30:45.470 --> 05:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
programming into the night uh whether
 
05:30:47.470 --> 05:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to get into that school uh
 
05:30:49.190 --> 05:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
with their grades are suffering or not
 
05:30:50.750 --> 05:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but they're certainly
 
05:30:53.670 --> 05:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
getting programming experience thank you
 
05:30:55.110 --> 05:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and representative
 
05:30:57.548 --> 05:30:57.558 align:start position:0%
Flanigan and then representative
 
05:31:00.670 --> 05:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
oh thank you thank you Mr chairman uh so
 
05:31:02.948 --> 05:31:02.958 align:start position:0%
that means if someone's 14 or 15 they
 
05:31:05.510 --> 05:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
can work unlimited hours no federal law
 
05:31:05.520 --> 05:31:06.910 align:start position:0%
can work unlimited hours no federal law
prohibits

05:31:06.910 --> 05:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
05:31:11.830 --> 05:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
that federal law at at least for now I I
 
05:31:13.470 --> 05:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
Market Basket has some young people
 
05:31:15.230 --> 05:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
working for him and I think they
 
05:31:18.030 --> 05:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
advertise for 14 year olds but it's very
 
05:31:20.868 --> 05:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's very it's limited by federal law
 
05:31:20.878 --> 05:31:22.270 align:start position:0%
it's very it's limited by federal law
okay

05:31:22.270 --> 05:31:22.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:28.590 --> 05:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:30.990 --> 05:31:31.000 align:start position:0%

put okay thank you appreciate that
 
05:32:25.150 --> 05:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Wen all
 
05:32:26.070 --> 05:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chairman
 
05:32:29.390 --> 05:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative kill yes if I can direct
 
05:32:31.310 --> 05:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
your attention to the final section of
 
05:32:36.830 --> 05:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
the bill lines 14- 16 14 through 16 they
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
state during the months in which school
 
05:32:41.670 --> 05:32:41.680 align:start position:0%
is in session no youth shall be
 
05:32:43.590 --> 05:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
permitted to work later than 9:00
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
p.m. as you stated earlier uh schools
 
05:32:51.190 --> 05:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
now many schools will extend the school
 
05:32:54.190 --> 05:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
year will extend into early June and
 
05:32:57.270 --> 05:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
some will start in late August
 
05:32:59.990 --> 05:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
so by the Plain reading of this would
 
05:33:03.788 --> 05:33:03.798 align:start position:0%
that mean that no student could work
 
05:33:03.798 --> 05:33:04.948 align:start position:0%
that mean that no student could work
past

05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
9:00 uh in early August or in late June
 
05:33:10.670 --> 05:33:10.680 align:start position:0%
because those are in fact months in
 
05:33:12.030 --> 05:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
which school is in
 
05:33:15.708 --> 05:33:15.718 align:start position:0%
session uh no because
 
05:33:18.430 --> 05:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
the months during the time during
 
05:33:20.590 --> 05:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
between the date on which school year
 
05:33:24.070 --> 05:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
begins and the date the school year ends
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we're really speaking
 
05:33:29.190 --> 05:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
about if if I need to fix that line I'd
 
05:33:31.470 --> 05:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
be happy to do so
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
followup for followup sir
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
I this new section
 
05:33:39.788 --> 05:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about and asking about
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
says in addition to the provisions of
 
05:33:44.548 --> 05:33:44.558 align:start position:0%
27684 so it seems like this would be
 
05:33:47.990 --> 05:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
even more restrictive than uh your
 
05:33:51.430 --> 05:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
earlier uh earlier notation in the bill
 
05:33:53.470 --> 05:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
that the school year begins when it
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
begins it
 
05:33:54.840 --> 05:34:02.030 align:start position:0%
begins it
ends

05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.430 --> 05:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:13.510 --> 05:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
well again the the intent is to is to
 
05:34:16.310 --> 05:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
have the 900
 
05:34:20.350 --> 05:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
pm and the 11: PM apply during the
 
05:34:20.360 --> 05:34:21.310 align:start position:0%
pm and the 11: PM apply during the
school

05:34:21.310 --> 05:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:34:24.628 --> 05:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
year um and if that's on if that needs
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
to be changed I'd be happy to do that so
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
that instead of during the months when
 
05:34:30.190 --> 05:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
school is in the session during the
 
05:34:32.628 --> 05:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
aforementioned school year that would be
 
05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:41.510 --> 05:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:44.830 --> 05:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
okay represent
 
05:34:47.150 --> 05:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
sylvestro thank you thank you for taking
 
05:34:50.990 --> 05:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
my question uh representative line uh 15
 
05:34:52.670 --> 05:34:52.680 align:start position:0%
if this was mentioned before I'm sorry
 
05:34:55.868 --> 05:34:55.878 align:start position:0%
if I didn't catch it uh you have working
 
05:34:58.548 --> 05:34:58.558 align:start position:0%
no later than 900m on Sunday through
 
05:35:01.708 --> 05:35:01.718 align:start position:0%
Thursday but if it were a Monday holiday
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
would they not be able to
 
05:35:06.628 --> 05:35:06.638 align:start position:0%
work that what you just CL I apologize
 
05:35:09.070 --> 05:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
that sounds like the proud
 
05:35:10.990 --> 05:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
then okay I just want to be sure I
 
05:35:12.868 --> 05:35:12.878 align:start position:0%
wasn't misunderstanding okay very good
 
05:35:15.230 --> 05:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative Prout do you have a
 
05:35:17.510 --> 05:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
followup um follow up to a different
 
05:35:17.520 --> 05:35:19.030 align:start position:0%
followup um follow up to a different
conversation

05:35:19.030 --> 05:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:35:22.350 --> 05:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
actually um I'm noticing that a
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
difference between the text in section
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
one section two whereas in section one
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
it only applies to uh youths that are
 
05:35:32.548 --> 05:35:32.558 align:start position:0%
duly enrolled in school whereas section
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
two doesn't have that limitation so if a
 
05:35:38.948 --> 05:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
a 16 or 17 1-year-old is no longer ruled
 
05:35:40.150 --> 05:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
in school perhaps because they have
 
05:35:41.910 --> 05:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
graduated and they're still
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
17 um they would still be subject to
 
05:35:44.760 --> 05:35:46.190 align:start position:0%
17 um they would still be subject to
these

05:35:46.190 --> 05:35:46.200 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:35:48.628 --> 05:35:48.638 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh another wonderful catch
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
representative proud and uh we could
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
readily fix that thank
 
05:35:56.070 --> 05:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
05:35:59.310 --> 05:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
nalani thank you Mr chairman
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
um you held up violations are those
 
05:36:04.390 --> 05:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
violations since we changed the law or
 
05:36:05.948 --> 05:36:05.958 align:start position:0%
are those overall violations over a
 
05:36:08.150 --> 05:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
different period those are older
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
how old um a few years a few years yeah
 
05:36:14.030 --> 05:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
back when the before the law was changed
 
05:36:15.548 --> 05:36:15.558 align:start position:0%
thank you follow they're not all they're
 
05:36:18.110 --> 05:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
not all this night work follow up Mr
 
05:36:19.628 --> 05:36:19.638 align:start position:0%
chairman yes for a followup how do you
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
square away the school year begins and
 
05:36:23.190 --> 05:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
the date the school year ends or the
 
05:36:25.110 --> 05:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
school school year ends and the date on
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
which It Begins for the following school
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
year if they are going to school out of
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
state because we we have people that
 
05:36:34.948 --> 05:36:34.958 align:start position:0%
immigrate in immigrate out for school
 
05:36:37.830 --> 05:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
right um well I think what what happened
 
05:36:39.750 --> 05:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
now if you have if you have a business
 
05:36:42.070 --> 05:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and you have high school kids maybe
 
05:36:43.470 --> 05:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're coming from two different
 
05:36:46.708 --> 05:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
schools and you know not too far away
 
05:36:48.430 --> 05:36:48.440 align:start position:0%
you would uh take a look at the
 
05:36:49.948 --> 05:36:49.958 align:start position:0%
calendars and know when the school
 
05:36:51.910 --> 05:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
starts and when the school begins and
 
05:36:53.628 --> 05:36:53.638 align:start position:0%
furthermore you would know when holidays
 
05:36:55.628 --> 05:36:55.638 align:start position:0%
they take and when their week-long
 
05:36:57.670 --> 05:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
vacation occurs which I know they're
 
05:36:59.230 --> 05:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
looking forward to one coming up later
 
05:37:02.310 --> 05:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
this month in many cases I would imagine
 
05:37:04.750 --> 05:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
that if you had somebody crossing the
 
05:37:08.948 --> 05:37:08.958 align:start position:0%
border uh from Vermont or or or or
 
05:37:10.750 --> 05:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're willing to take a
 
05:37:14.150 --> 05:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
lower wage um you could also do the same
 
05:37:16.110 --> 05:37:16.120 align:start position:0%
diligence to make sure that they were
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
out of school and not playing
 
05:37:20.910 --> 05:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
hookie follow for followup sir so how
 
05:37:24.350 --> 05:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
would a uh employer um somebody turns
 
05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
them in saying they had a high school
 
05:37:27.788 --> 05:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
kid working during the week when
 
05:37:30.230 --> 05:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
everybody else was in school and do
 
05:37:32.910 --> 05:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
shows up to their door and says how come
 
05:37:35.430 --> 05:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
this person was here last week would you
 
05:37:36.910 --> 05:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
expect more violations or less
 
05:37:36.920 --> 05:37:38.030 align:start position:0%
expect more violations or less
violations

05:37:38.030 --> 05:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
violations
 
05:37:40.628 --> 05:37:40.638 align:start position:0%
uh I would expect less violations and I
 
05:37:44.150 --> 05:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
would expect that uh do isn't going to
 
05:37:45.948 --> 05:37:45.958 align:start position:0%
show up at your door I think they would
 
05:37:48.350 --> 05:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
at least give you a call first and
 
05:37:52.230 --> 05:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps ask you a question uh I don't
 
05:37:53.948 --> 05:37:53.958 align:start position:0%
know that they would just show up and
 
05:37:56.390 --> 05:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
let's see your payroll records and
 
05:37:59.110 --> 05:37:59.120 align:start position:0%
looking for this kid from uh Albuquerque
 
05:38:01.470 --> 05:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you and one final
 
05:38:04.510 --> 05:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman yes sir um setting
 
05:38:06.948 --> 05:38:06.958 align:start position:0%
a standard for 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m.
 
05:38:09.470 --> 05:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
if a child if a student was to sign up
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
with to punch out at 9005 that would
 
05:38:13.910 --> 05:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
trigger a violation for the
 
05:38:17.190 --> 05:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
do uh I suppose that is technically
 
05:38:20.590 --> 05:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
correct but um I I would I would be
 
05:38:23.628 --> 05:38:23.638 align:start position:0%
surprised if that was meriting an
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforceable an enforced violation and
 
05:38:29.190 --> 05:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
especially if it wasn't uh you know
 
05:38:31.310 --> 05:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
frequent and five minutes is is minimal
 
05:38:34.628 --> 05:38:34.638 align:start position:0%
I think there I think there's probably a
 
05:38:37.150 --> 05:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
threshold this will be a final one Mr
 
05:38:38.830 --> 05:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman is this your third final one
 
05:38:40.110 --> 05:38:40.120 align:start position:0%
third final one all right okay I just
 
05:38:42.270 --> 05:38:42.280 align:start position:0%
check somebody to use the
 
05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh reference to Market Basket many
 
05:38:48.548 --> 05:38:48.558 align:start position:0%
employees and if there was a line at the
 
05:38:51.350 --> 05:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
punch out machine and everybody all of a
 
05:38:53.708 --> 05:38:53.718 align:start position:0%
sudden you're 10 back 10 12 Back and
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
You're punching out 9006 9007 9008 right
 
05:38:59.910 --> 05:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
it would trigger if the if the do was in
 
05:39:02.230 --> 05:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
there doing a records check on youth
 
05:39:04.670 --> 05:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
employment it would trigger violations
 
05:39:05.948 --> 05:39:05.958 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you bring up
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
Market Basket uh but let me let me if
 
05:39:10.390 --> 05:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have a line of people all punching
 
05:39:13.230 --> 05:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
out 9006 9007 I I think that offers a
 
05:39:15.788 --> 05:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
plausible explanation that they were and
 
05:39:17.030 --> 05:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
they were completed their work and
 
05:39:19.110 --> 05:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
merely trying to do the accounting so
 
05:39:20.830 --> 05:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
that they would be paid appropriately
 
05:39:23.548 --> 05:39:23.558 align:start position:0%
and God forbid not have any overtime but
 
05:39:25.310 --> 05:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
You' mentioned Market Basket and you
 
05:39:27.070 --> 05:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
will remember the former Deputy
 
05:39:29.548 --> 05:39:29.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioner uh Rudy Ogden who said to
 
05:39:31.310 --> 05:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
me you know that looking at all these
 
05:39:33.430 --> 05:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
other places with multiple violations
 
05:39:36.190 --> 05:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
Market Basket doesn't have any Market
 
05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
Basket pays attention to it and I don't
 
05:39:42.070 --> 05:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:44.948 --> 05:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
hard okay thank you Mr chairman no more
 
05:39:48.868 --> 05:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
followups no good R schz thank you Mr
 
05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
chair I don't know if you can answer
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
this and I don't know if our friends
 
05:39:55.310 --> 05:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
from the do are going to speak but do
 
05:40:00.030 --> 05:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
you know if there's any need for um
 
05:40:03.230 --> 05:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
underage kids who are in school and it's
 
05:40:05.628 --> 05:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
the school year do their parents have to
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
give permission and is the school
 
05:40:11.190 --> 05:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
involved in any way in um making
 
05:40:14.310 --> 05:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
sure uh do they have any involvement I
 
05:40:15.910 --> 05:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
guess is really my question that's so
 
05:40:17.548 --> 05:40:17.558 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question I know at a
 
05:40:20.150 --> 05:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
certain age work papers are required and
 
05:40:21.990 --> 05:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the violations in this
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
folder uh but I don't know what I don't
 
05:40:26.150 --> 05:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
know off hand what the but I'm pretty
 
05:40:28.070 --> 05:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
confident that the labor department does
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
know and um and I don't I don't know
 
05:40:34.990 --> 05:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
that parental consent is part of it we
 
05:40:37.430 --> 05:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
can we can ask that when they testify
 
05:40:38.310 --> 05:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:40:42.070 --> 05:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
followup relatedly but if this is not
 
05:40:44.070 --> 05:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
the current law would you be open
 
05:40:45.990 --> 05:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendable to that as an amendment to
 
05:40:49.468 --> 05:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
your bill to require parental um
 
05:40:52.670 --> 05:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
permission or andoor School permission
 
05:40:55.270 --> 05:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
um I would not be opposed to that in a
 
05:40:55.280 --> 05:40:58.990 align:start position:0%
um I would not be opposed to that in a
Schultz

05:40:58.990 --> 05:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
Amendment all right seeing one more
 
05:41:04.670 --> 05:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
question sir thank you Mr chairman in
 
05:41:08.030 --> 05:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
the first section lines 2 through five
 
05:41:10.708 --> 05:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
you're adding language it
 
05:41:10.718 --> 05:41:12.468 align:start position:0%
you're adding language it
um

05:41:12.468 --> 05:41:12.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
basically they cannot work in a week
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
other than the school's vacation
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
week and is your intention that the
 
05:41:23.868 --> 05:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
because it says school's vacation week
 
05:41:28.430 --> 05:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
singularly is that the spring break week
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
and as a followup to that would that
 
05:41:33.868 --> 05:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
preclude them from working during
 
05:41:35.910 --> 05:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
Christmas break which may even be longer
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
than a week in their school for exam
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
example if a student uh Works selling
 
05:41:42.910 --> 05:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
Christmas trees at the corner lot then
 
05:41:44.310 --> 05:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
he would not be allowed to under this
 
05:41:45.670 --> 05:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
language with your change is that
 
05:41:48.510 --> 05:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
correct do I have that correct I I uh my
 
05:41:50.510 --> 05:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation is when the school is on
 
05:41:53.868 --> 05:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
vacation I believe they have two uh two
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
weeks uh February and April uh then the
 
05:42:00.510 --> 05:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
kid would work as if it were summer they
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
would not have the 9 or the 11:00
 
05:42:03.680 --> 05:42:08.350 align:start position:0%
would not have the 9 or the 11:00
restrictions

05:42:08.350 --> 05:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay so instead of
 
05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
the school's vacation week it should be
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
a school's vacation weeks right or
 
05:42:19.190 --> 05:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
school okay school vacation weeks either
 
05:42:19.200 --> 05:42:21.350 align:start position:0%
school okay school vacation weeks either
way

05:42:21.350 --> 05:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
plural all right uh represent Prout
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um again regarding
 
05:42:29.430 --> 05:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
section two for night workk it says
 
05:42:32.110 --> 05:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
after 9:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. but it
 
05:42:35.310 --> 05:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't say until when can kids clock in
 
05:42:40.030 --> 05:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
at 12:01 a.m. and work all through the
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
midnight shift or or what is the intent
 
05:42:48.310 --> 05:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
there uh that would not be the intent
 
05:42:50.628 --> 05:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that they're getting out
 
05:42:52.430 --> 05:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
of school at around
 
05:42:55.150 --> 05:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
3:00 and if this if the business is next
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
door that would be four o'l maybe if
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
they had a little snack for dinner uh
 
05:43:02.468 --> 05:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
five hours wouldn't be too
 
05:43:06.110 --> 05:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
bad uh for them to
 
05:43:09.868 --> 05:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
work I mean they're allowed 35 hours so
 
05:43:11.990 --> 05:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
5 hours every day after school would be
 
05:43:14.390 --> 05:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
no sorry following up because I I think
 
05:43:15.788 --> 05:43:15.798 align:start position:0%
you misunderstood the question perhaps
 
05:43:18.270 --> 05:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
they did um it says they can't work
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
later than 11:00 p.m. for example on a
 
05:43:23.670 --> 05:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
week weekend but could they clock in
 
05:43:25.708 --> 05:43:25.718 align:start position:0%
just after midnight and work till 5 or
 
05:43:27.628 --> 05:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
600 in the morning or for example if
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
they're a farmand and you know they have
 
05:43:31.750 --> 05:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
to get up and milk the cows at say 4:00
 
05:43:33.910 --> 05:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
a.m. or 3:30 a.m. and that's when they
 
05:43:36.270 --> 05:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
would clock in is that allowed I mean
 
05:43:38.868 --> 05:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
what's it says after 11:00 p.m. but it
 
05:43:41.670 --> 05:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't say until when and what is the
 
05:43:45.548 --> 05:43:45.558 align:start position:0%
what is the intent there um I I believe
 
05:43:48.070 --> 05:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
there are other restrictions about the
 
05:43:50.110 --> 05:43:50.120 align:start position:0%
hours the the beginning hours it can't
 
05:43:53.990 --> 05:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
be before 6: a.m. as as I recall but I
 
05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
did not change that or put that into the
 
05:43:59.030 --> 05:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
into this language uh that's another
 
05:44:01.150 --> 05:44:01.160 align:start position:0%
thing to look at but I don't I don't
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
anticipate many
 
05:44:05.548 --> 05:44:05.558 align:start position:0%
businesses starting starting someone Shi
 
05:44:07.670 --> 05:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
to 12 1201
 
05:44:11.830 --> 05:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
and having them go until 9 that evening
 
05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
thank you all right sir thank you for
 
05:44:15.868 --> 05:44:15.878 align:start position:0%
introducing the Bill thank you for your
 
05:44:17.868 --> 05:44:17.878 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'd like now i' like to
 
05:44:25.990 --> 05:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.190 --> 05:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
night good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
05:44:35.548 --> 05:44:35.558 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Mike
 
05:44:37.350 --> 05:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
Summers president CEO the New Hampshire
 
05:44:39.310 --> 05:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
LOD lodging and Restaurant Association
 
05:44:43.110 --> 05:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
excited to be with you again um uh again
 
05:44:44.670 --> 05:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
another bill that seems to be targeted
 
05:44:47.788 --> 05:44:47.798 align:start position:0%
squar restaurants so that's exciting um
 
05:44:50.310 --> 05:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
couple of things I would say that uh
 
05:44:52.868 --> 05:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
representative kahill's um efforts
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
around the language around uh changing
 
05:44:57.548 --> 05:44:57.558 align:start position:0%
you know the schools start of the school
 
05:44:59.390 --> 05:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
year end of the school year that kind of
 
05:45:02.868 --> 05:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
thing we kind of in two minds about it
 
05:45:05.670 --> 05:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
um ultimately I I guess we could live
 
05:45:08.190 --> 05:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
with those changes if we if we if we had
 
05:45:10.350 --> 05:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
to I think where we're really concerned
 
05:45:12.548 --> 05:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
more than anything is the reintroduction
 
05:45:15.390 --> 05:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
of night work um frankly it's only been
 
05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
a year or two since we took night night
 
05:45:19.350 --> 05:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
work away and I think uh part of the
 
05:45:21.868 --> 05:45:21.878 align:start position:0%
reason for that was it was uh incredibly
 
05:45:23.510 --> 05:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
hard for businesses to manage now
 
05:45:25.030 --> 05:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
frankly the way it was written before
 
05:45:27.910 --> 05:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
was even worse um so I will concede that
 
05:45:30.868 --> 05:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
point but um part of the part of the
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
reasons for the effort when it when it
 
05:45:34.548 --> 05:45:34.558 align:start position:0%
uh when we eliminated night work was
 
05:45:37.150 --> 05:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
simply because this really aligns state
 
05:45:39.190 --> 05:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
with federal law and the biggest problem
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
for businesses in New Hampshire is that
 
05:45:42.868 --> 05:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
we have two standards on many things
 
05:45:44.670 --> 05:45:44.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in the wage and our space
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
so for example you'll have situations
 
05:45:49.910 --> 05:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
where uh 16 and 17 year olds can't work
 
05:45:52.350 --> 05:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
past 9:00 in New Hampshire assuming this
 
05:45:54.868 --> 05:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
passes but under federal law there's no
 
05:45:56.548 --> 05:45:56.558 align:start position:0%
restriction on that so you would have a
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
scenario where the US Department of
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
Labor may do an audit and say yeah sure
 
05:46:01.750 --> 05:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
let them work whatever they want to work
 
05:46:03.070 --> 05:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
and then the New Hampshire Department
 
05:46:04.830 --> 05:46:04.840 align:start position:0%
Labor comes in under a complaint and now
 
05:46:07.110 --> 05:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
we have you know 15 different violations
 
05:46:09.910 --> 05:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
so that that uh disparity between state
 
05:46:11.510 --> 05:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
and federal is what creates the biggest
 
05:46:13.270 --> 05:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
headaches for small businesses
 
05:46:16.590 --> 05:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
particularly so reintroducing this I
 
05:46:18.510 --> 05:46:18.520 align:start position:0%
think creates a lot of problems for our
 
05:46:21.030 --> 05:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
business owners and I I appreciate the
 
05:46:22.350 --> 05:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
argument that you know students should
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
be focusing on their their education Etc
 
05:46:26.750 --> 05:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
but you know my son when he played
 
05:46:28.390 --> 05:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
soccer in high school I mean he was at
 
05:46:30.190 --> 05:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
practice till 11 o'clock at night you
 
05:46:31.830 --> 05:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
know three nights a week five five
 
05:46:33.390 --> 05:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
nights a week when they were in season
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
so I don't really buy the difference
 
05:46:38.868 --> 05:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
between working and you know learning a
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
skill in a career and trade and life
 
05:46:42.910 --> 05:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
skills versus you know playing soccer or
 
05:46:45.430 --> 05:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
some other sport
 
05:46:48.190 --> 05:46:48.200 align:start position:0%
um and and I I guess uh the biggest
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
issue one of the big issues is uh
 
05:46:52.468 --> 05:46:52.478 align:start position:0%
getting teenagers to do the things you
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
need them to do is a challenge and for
 
05:46:55.830 --> 05:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
those of you who have kids I'm not
 
05:46:56.948 --> 05:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
telling you anything you don't already
 
05:46:59.070 --> 05:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
know but to get them to clock out at
 
05:47:01.708 --> 05:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
9:00 or before is is a is usually a
 
05:47:04.110 --> 05:47:04.120 align:start position:0%
problem um so and to representative
 
05:47:05.628 --> 05:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
Alan's point about you know there's a
 
05:47:07.310 --> 05:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
line of kids trying to clock out 9 and
 
05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have 9056 7 89 yes those would all
 
05:47:12.590 --> 05:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
be uh violations and yes they would
 
05:47:14.788 --> 05:47:14.798 align:start position:0%
stack and yes uh those would be issued
 
05:47:18.430 --> 05:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
so um so I think those are my my big uh
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
big concerns and with that I'm happy to
 
05:47:22.270 --> 05:47:22.280 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions oh I guess
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
the one last thing I would say is there
 
05:47:27.190 --> 05:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
was a comment made that if an uh 16 or
 
05:47:28.750 --> 05:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
17 year old was told that we need you to
 
05:47:30.468 --> 05:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
work till 10 and they refuse to and then
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
they get fired there is not a business
 
05:47:33.788 --> 05:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
on in the state of New Hampshire right
 
05:47:35.548 --> 05:47:35.558 align:start position:0%
now is going to fire a teenager because
 
05:47:37.590 --> 05:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
we can't replace them
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
so uh there's a lot of flexibility there
 
05:47:42.150 --> 05:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
and parents and their Stu their children
 
05:47:44.628 --> 05:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
have an awful lot of Rights uh and and
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
Power in that discussion so thank you
 
05:47:49.110 --> 05:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
all right reprid Warden thank you in
 
05:47:52.468 --> 05:47:52.478 align:start position:0%
your in your experience is it is it
 
05:47:54.788 --> 05:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
common where there are some students who
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
want to work extra hours because they're
 
05:47:58.270 --> 05:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
saving up for example for college
 
05:48:00.830 --> 05:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
expensive or buy a new car and they
 
05:48:02.350 --> 05:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
would like the opportunity to work
 
05:48:04.390 --> 05:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
Beyond nine o'clock yes we've certainly
 
05:48:05.948 --> 05:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
seen that and we've also seen some
 
05:48:08.590 --> 05:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
instances where uh a student is only
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
working the minimum possible hours and
 
05:48:10.910 --> 05:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're only doing it because their
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
parents are making them do it you know
 
05:48:14.350 --> 05:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
life skills and those kinds of things uh
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
less and less more these days but yes
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
we've certainly seen
 
05:48:20.910 --> 05:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
that Ram labry thank you Mr chair and
 
05:48:22.830 --> 05:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh what
 
05:48:24.030 --> 05:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
percentage would you say make up the
 
05:48:26.230 --> 05:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
workforce of 16 and 17 year olds in the
 
05:48:28.270 --> 05:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant and hotel industry what what
 
05:48:29.788 --> 05:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
percentage is out there the reason I ask
 
05:48:32.390 --> 05:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
is because they're for my industry um
 
05:48:34.868 --> 05:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
they're almost as elusive as perhaps a a
 
05:48:38.150 --> 05:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
kangaroo pelt
 
05:48:41.030 --> 05:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question um so I will
 
05:48:43.590 --> 05:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
say that U they're not a huge portion of
 
05:48:45.430 --> 05:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
our Workforce um but that certainly a
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
critical part of our Workforce because
 
05:48:48.390 --> 05:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that would be busing
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
tables running food doing those kind of
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
you know hostessing they're the kind of
 
05:48:53.788 --> 05:48:53.798 align:start position:0%
the part-time positions that are only
 
05:48:55.868 --> 05:48:55.878 align:start position:0%
for a few hours in the course of a shift
 
05:48:56.830 --> 05:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things but they're
 
05:48:58.990 --> 05:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
certainly not the backbone of our of our
 
05:48:59.000 --> 05:49:00.990 align:start position:0%
certainly not the backbone of our of our
Workforce

05:49:00.990 --> 05:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chairman good to
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
see you again Mr Summers um look a
 
05:49:06.990 --> 05:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
couple years ago we also rolled hold
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
back the ability for 16 year 16 and 17
 
05:49:12.750 --> 05:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
year olds to bus tables that had alcohol
 
05:49:15.750 --> 05:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
on them correct um we also remove the
 
05:49:17.548 --> 05:49:17.558 align:start position:0%
time limit because some places are open
 
05:49:21.868 --> 05:49:21.878 align:start position:0%
till 10:00 and owners would have to
 
05:49:24.468 --> 05:49:24.478 align:start position:0%
schedule two different people um could
 
05:49:26.548 --> 05:49:26.558 align:start position:0%
you speak to that and how that would
 
05:49:30.788 --> 05:49:30.798 align:start position:0%
affect if this bill passed yeah so
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
frankly I think the as I mentioned
 
05:49:34.230 --> 05:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
earlier the biggest challenge was that
 
05:49:35.990 --> 05:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
misalignment between state and federal
 
05:49:37.788 --> 05:49:37.798 align:start position:0%
because now you have a situation where
 
05:49:39.070 --> 05:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
you would literally have to send some of
 
05:49:42.190 --> 05:49:42.200 align:start position:0%
your staff home at you know 9:00 um and
 
05:49:44.070 --> 05:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
you may to your point be open till 9:30
 
05:49:45.708 --> 05:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
or 10 and and you know clean up whatever
 
05:49:48.708 --> 05:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
it might be but we certain and and we
 
05:49:50.750 --> 05:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
they repealed the restriction on um you
 
05:49:52.350 --> 05:49:52.360 align:start position:0%
know 16 17 year olds working in the
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
lounge setting uh because frankly it was
 
05:49:56.390 --> 05:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
an Antiquated law and it really had no
 
05:50:00.030 --> 05:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
place um didn't make any sense uh but uh
 
05:50:02.628 --> 05:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
obviously you know these guys the 16 17
 
05:50:04.070 --> 05:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
year olds are critical to our industry
 
05:50:05.430 --> 05:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're critical to the grocery store
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
industry to the retail industry
 
05:50:09.670 --> 05:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
um but you know
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
again it's
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
exciting thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
05:50:16.548 --> 05:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
all right represent McKenzie thank you
 
05:50:18.468 --> 05:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
uh you would know more about this
 
05:50:19.990 --> 05:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
tonight because I didn't spend a whole
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of time in youth employment but
 
05:50:23.548 --> 05:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
could you speak into the mic please I'm
 
05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
sorry about
 
05:50:27.990 --> 05:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
that so the uh the federal had the
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
federal laws are in place as well so are
 
05:50:32.590 --> 05:50:32.600 align:start position:0%
you suggesting that this conflicts with
 
05:50:34.670 --> 05:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
the federal laws that that the federal
 
05:50:36.948 --> 05:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
laws are more lenient than would be be
 
05:50:40.670 --> 05:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the state laws yes so for 16 and
 
05:50:42.030 --> 05:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
17 year olds there are no real
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions on on youth uh employment
 
05:50:46.708 --> 05:50:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh 14 and 15 they certainly are and your
 
05:50:48.708 --> 05:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
question earlier and I think Department
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
of label will answer this question but
 
05:50:53.310 --> 05:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh 14 13 14 15 rols they can't work past
 
05:50:53.320 --> 05:50:55.590 align:start position:0%
uh 14 13 14 15 rols they can't work past
7

05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
7
 
05:50:58.230 --> 05:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
pm thank
 
05:51:01.150 --> 05:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
you all right see no further questions
 
05:51:04.110 --> 05:51:04.120 align:start position:0%
oh representive C go ahead just uh thank
 
05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I got a question when it
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
comes to industry this bill itself what
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
specifically would it affect or how
 
05:51:12.910 --> 05:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
would it affect restaurants and
 
05:51:14.948 --> 05:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
businesses do you think
 
05:51:17.590 --> 05:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
negatively so it just creates another
 
05:51:20.070 --> 05:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden for the businesses uh
 
05:51:21.708 --> 05:51:21.718 align:start position:0%
more than likely it's going to lead to
 
05:51:24.750 --> 05:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
more uh penalties and fees Department of
 
05:51:26.510 --> 05:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
Labor uh because again I think the
 
05:51:27.948 --> 05:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
biggest challenge we had with like a
 
05:51:29.788 --> 05:51:29.798 align:start position:0%
9:00 p.m. or whatever the the time cut
 
05:51:31.390 --> 05:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
off was the issue was we could never get
 
05:51:33.510 --> 05:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
people to clock out on time and not for
 
05:51:35.708 --> 05:51:35.718 align:start position:0%
want of trying um it's a case of you
 
05:51:38.830 --> 05:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
know go clock out at 9:45 and at 10:15
 
05:51:40.070 --> 05:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're still walking around talking to
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
their friends so it is what it is it's
 
05:51:44.230 --> 05:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
the the teenage experience but that
 
05:51:45.830 --> 05:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
frankly has been the huge biggest hurdle
 
05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
for our industry um is getting them to
 
05:51:49.390 --> 05:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
actually clock out on time so that we're
 
05:51:53.070 --> 05:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
not facing penalties fees fines
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
Etc all right great thank you sir
 
05:51:58.750 --> 05:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:00.590 --> 05:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon Miss
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:16.070 --> 05:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Danielle
 
05:52:17.350 --> 05:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
Albert I'm the Deputy Commissioner of
 
05:52:18.750 --> 05:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
05:52:20.750 --> 05:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me here today um
 
05:52:22.190 --> 05:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
I'm here with Attorney John garrian
 
05:52:24.468 --> 05:52:24.478 align:start position:0%
General councel to the department um the
 
05:52:26.868 --> 05:52:26.878 align:start position:0%
department has reviewed the language uh
 
05:52:30.030 --> 05:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
that is proposed in House Bill 379 We
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
believe We Understand its um intent and
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
its purpose to kind of start by
 
05:52:35.390 --> 05:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
addressing the night work provision and
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that have been
 
05:52:38.990 --> 05:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
raised around state requirements as they
 
05:52:40.548 --> 05:52:40.558 align:start position:0%
exist currently and federal law
 
05:52:42.990 --> 05:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
requirements as they exist um currently
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
uh both the state law and the federal
 
05:52:46.750 --> 05:52:46.760 align:start position:0%
law so New Hampshire's law and the fsla
 
05:52:50.070 --> 05:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
both address um our uh timing
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
requirements I.E how early or how late a
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
youth who's under the age of 16 can work
 
05:52:57.830 --> 05:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
so you're 14 15 year olds um 13 year
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
olds under current iteration of state
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
law and you can find the provision at
 
05:53:04.590 --> 05:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
RSA 276
 
05:53:07.628 --> 05:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
A4 um youth who are under the 16 years
 
05:53:10.830 --> 05:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
of age can't work earlier than 700 a.m.
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
and no later than 900 p.m. when we look
 
05:53:15.670 --> 05:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
at the federal side what the fsla
 
05:53:18.350 --> 05:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
requires um youth of that age can start
 
05:53:21.670 --> 05:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
no no earlier than 7 a.m. and no later
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
than 7 p.m. except in summer when it it
 
05:53:29.070 --> 05:53:29.080 align:start position:0%
rises up to 900 p.m. so um by way of the
 
05:53:31.310 --> 05:53:31.320 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised relative to
 
05:53:35.670 --> 05:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
if this provision um creating 276 a13a
 
05:53:37.230 --> 05:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
regarding Night War were to go into
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
effect would that um not line up
 
05:53:42.190 --> 05:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
perfectly or exactly with how fsla
 
05:53:44.708 --> 05:53:44.718 align:start position:0%
treats it I think that that is accurate
 
05:53:47.948 --> 05:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
under this proposed language youth would
 
05:53:49.948 --> 05:53:49.958 align:start position:0%
um not be permitted to work later than
 
05:53:52.070 --> 05:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
900 p.m. Sunday through Thursday but
 
05:53:54.150 --> 05:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
that time then goes up to 11:00 p.m. on
 
05:53:56.390 --> 05:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
Friday and Saturday employers who were
 
05:53:58.590 --> 05:53:58.600 align:start position:0%
subject to the fsla and state law would
 
05:54:01.628 --> 05:54:01.638 align:start position:0%
need to be mindful of both requirements
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
um just for a point of context of
 
05:54:05.468 --> 05:54:05.478 align:start position:0%
understanding while the depart if if
 
05:54:08.270 --> 05:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
this were to pass and if a youth of that
 
05:54:10.910 --> 05:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
age were working up to 10: p.m. may not
 
05:54:12.868 --> 05:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of a violation under
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state requirement it may be a
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
different story under the federal
 
05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
requirement so um point I am trying to
 
05:54:19.750 --> 05:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
highlight is the employers would have to
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
be mindful of both requirements even
 
05:54:22.830 --> 05:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
though the state's not regulating the
 
05:54:25.628 --> 05:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
federal law that would come from us do
 
05:54:27.868 --> 05:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
um as a technical Point um in the
 
05:54:29.868 --> 05:54:29.878 align:start position:0%
language that's proposed for night workk
 
05:54:32.548 --> 05:54:32.558 align:start position:0%
it does reference specifically that no
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
youth shall be permitted to work within
 
05:54:37.468 --> 05:54:37.478 align:start position:0%
um later than the prescribed hours no
 
05:54:39.270 --> 05:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
youth as the department understands it
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
encompasses youth um inclusive of um 16
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
17 15 14 13 there are our prescriptions
 
05:54:50.000 --> 05:54:51.070 align:start position:0%
17 15 14 13 there are our prescriptions
at

05:54:51.070 --> 05:54:51.080 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
276a um that differ for the Youth who
 
05:54:56.948 --> 05:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
are under 16 from what this night work
 
05:54:59.070 --> 05:54:59.080 align:start position:0%
provision is putting forward so if the
 
05:55:01.510 --> 05:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
intent is for the um night work Bill to
 
05:55:03.990 --> 05:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
address just those 16 and 17 year olds
 
05:55:05.910 --> 05:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
there may be benefit to specifying as
 
05:55:07.590 --> 05:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
such otherwise there could be a
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
potential conflict with the hour
 
05:55:10.990 --> 05:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions for under 16s that
 
05:55:14.270 --> 05:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
currently exist at section 4 um again
 
05:55:18.670 --> 05:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
the the under 16s are uh limited to um
 
05:55:21.510 --> 05:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
currently working no later than 900 p.m.
 
05:55:23.628 --> 05:55:23.638 align:start position:0%
this now authorizes two days a week when
 
05:55:25.270 --> 05:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
they could work until 11:00 p.m. and
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
those two May conflict with one another
 
05:55:29.910 --> 05:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
if they both go into effect without
 
05:55:33.670 --> 05:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
change um as it relates to the first
 
05:55:38.830 --> 05:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
provision uh uh amending the language uh
 
05:55:40.948 --> 05:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of hours that can
 
05:55:42.910 --> 05:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
be worked for 16 and 17 year olds when
 
05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
school is in session um those particular
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
sections appear to be removing the
 
05:55:48.590 --> 05:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
language relative to predetermined work
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
week in which school is in session um
 
05:55:54.910 --> 05:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
for 5 days it is now more broadly
 
05:55:56.670 --> 05:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
referencing the date between when the
 
05:55:58.070 --> 05:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
school year begins and the date when the
 
05:55:59.468 --> 05:55:59.478 align:start position:0%
school year ends the department
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
understand what that means although we
 
05:56:04.708 --> 05:56:04.718 align:start position:0%
would note um it's not so clear what
 
05:56:07.548 --> 05:56:07.558 align:start position:0%
week is being uh being referenced by the
 
05:56:08.910 --> 05:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
statute is it the employer's
 
05:56:10.830 --> 05:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
predetermined work week or that week
 
05:56:12.390 --> 05:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
schedule is it a more commonly
 
05:56:14.390 --> 05:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
understood Monday through Sunday type of
 
05:56:16.830 --> 05:56:16.840 align:start position:0%
week um so some clarification in that
 
05:56:19.110 --> 05:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
regard may be of benefit we potentially
 
05:56:21.750 --> 05:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
could foresee um maybe inconsistent
 
05:56:24.468 --> 05:56:24.478 align:start position:0%
understanding from employers on applying
 
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh what week means when determining
 
05:56:27.948 --> 05:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
whether or not youth in that particular
 
05:56:30.590 --> 05:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
age category are going um you know above
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
or staying within the 35-hour uh limit
 
05:56:35.788 --> 05:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
that's prescribed um and we are happy to
 
05:56:38.628 --> 05:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
take any questions if there may be any
 
05:56:40.670 --> 05:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative proud thank you Mr
 
05:56:41.868 --> 05:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
question um under the federal or state
 
05:56:47.390 --> 05:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
law for the 13 to 15 year olds are there
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
any industry specific carve outs on the
 
05:56:52.230 --> 05:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
hours like for example in
 
05:56:54.590 --> 05:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
agriculture that's an excellent question
 
05:56:56.590 --> 05:56:56.600 align:start position:0%
I would need to go I would potentially
 
05:56:59.310 --> 05:56:59.320 align:start position:0%
need to research under the fsla um there
 
05:57:02.628 --> 05:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
are certain exemptions uh for youth
 
05:57:05.190 --> 05:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
labor more so in like the Hazardous
 
05:57:08.510 --> 05:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
occupations context for agricultural um
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
and my vague recollection is there may
 
05:57:12.830 --> 05:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
be some um our restrict something more
 
05:57:14.948 --> 05:57:14.958 align:start position:0%
formal together check the laws and make
 
05:57:16.110 --> 05:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
certain that the answer I'm giving is
 
05:57:17.510 --> 05:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
accurate is it okay if I follow up with
 
05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
you on that absolutely thank you yeah
 
05:57:22.270 --> 05:57:22.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lry thank you
 
05:57:24.310 --> 05:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you for taking my
 
05:57:26.670 --> 05:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
question in the case of a violation
 
05:57:30.750 --> 05:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
which polls rank NHD or federal do do do
 
05:57:33.070 --> 05:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question and I I
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't really know that it's a um an
 
05:57:38.670 --> 05:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
issue of who pulls rank uh there can be
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
circumstances where violations occur
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
both at the state and the federal level
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
and there's involvement from State
 
05:57:47.070 --> 05:57:47.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and US Department of
 
05:57:49.270 --> 05:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
Labor um efforts are made to not you
 
05:57:52.788 --> 05:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
know duplicate I.E um if wages are being
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
adjusted both agencies are not going to
 
05:57:57.150 --> 05:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
adjust wages but you could arguably have
 
05:58:00.990 --> 05:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
a scenario where um youth hour um
 
05:58:02.468 --> 05:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
prohibitions under state law are
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
violated State Department of Labor is
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
involved a violation is cited uh US
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has gone in they
 
05:58:10.590 --> 05:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
find violations under the federal law
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
and also site under their laws
 
05:58:16.230 --> 05:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
violations how us do approaches
 
05:58:18.628 --> 05:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
investigations or how they determine
 
05:58:20.788 --> 05:58:20.798 align:start position:0%
their violations I I I can't speak to
 
05:58:22.590 --> 05:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
since I'm not part of that federal
 
05:58:24.990 --> 05:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
system um but you could arguably have
 
05:58:27.990 --> 05:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
situations where there's um where both
 
05:58:30.270 --> 05:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
both agencies could cite violations okay
 
05:58:32.270 --> 05:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
follow up I think you just answered it
 
05:58:35.150 --> 05:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
um from a guidance perspective who you
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
know if was one is 700 p.m. and one is
 
05:58:37.360 --> 05:58:38.190 align:start position:0%
know if was one is 700 p.m. and one is
9:00

05:58:38.190 --> 05:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
9:00
 
05:58:41.190 --> 05:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
p.m. where do we as business owner yeah
 
05:58:42.548 --> 05:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
who do we listen to and I've got caught
 
05:58:45.110 --> 05:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
up in this before where it's it's who
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
who pulls rank yeah no that's a that is
 
05:58:49.750 --> 05:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
also a really excellent question so you
 
05:58:52.230 --> 05:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
know us do puts out guidance and again I
 
05:58:54.270 --> 05:58:54.280 align:start position:0%
won't I won't speak for them or as to
 
05:58:55.510 --> 05:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
where their guidance come from they
 
05:58:57.990 --> 05:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
generally guide um you know abide by the
 
05:58:59.670 --> 05:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
more restrictive of the two requirements
 
05:59:00.990 --> 05:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
because then you're in compliance with
 
05:59:04.350 --> 05:59:04.360 align:start position:0%
both um so you know in a situation such
 
05:59:07.390 --> 05:59:07.400 align:start position:0%
as um this proposed language If This
 
05:59:09.948 --> 05:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
Were to go into effect you um dep the
 
05:59:12.030 --> 05:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Labor would
 
05:59:14.990 --> 05:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
not have concern about violation with a
 
05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
youth who's 16 working uh or a youth
 
05:59:19.830 --> 05:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
who's 15 working until 11 on a Friday
 
05:59:22.510 --> 05:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
because it's authorized by state law USD
 
05:59:24.350 --> 05:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
may take exception to that because their
 
05:59:26.310 --> 05:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
requirement is you can't work past seven
 
05:59:28.030 --> 05:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
or nine depending where in the year you
 
05:59:30.190 --> 05:59:30.200 align:start position:0%
are and you and that employer then may
 
05:59:33.390 --> 05:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
be um dealing with violations uh at the
 
05:59:35.628 --> 05:59:35.638 align:start position:0%
federal level through the US do if you
 
05:59:37.310 --> 05:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
comply with the more restrictive of the
 
05:59:39.868 --> 05:59:39.878 align:start position:0%
two arguably you're keeping yourself in
 
05:59:42.070 --> 05:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with both you're welcome and
 
05:59:45.510 --> 05:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
represent Schultz thank you Mr chair and
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
um forgive me my views on this have
 
05:59:49.548 --> 05:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
changed dramatically since I was this
 
05:59:52.230 --> 05:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
age and now I'm 54 so forgive me that I
 
05:59:57.230 --> 05:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
do not know this um do are is there any
 
06:00:00.990 --> 06:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
arrangement for parents to give
 
06:00:04.390 --> 06:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
permission and to what degree does that
 
06:00:08.830 --> 06:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
factor in yes so under current state law
 
06:00:10.708 --> 06:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
there are certain types of permissions
 
06:00:12.910 --> 06:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
dependent upon age category again we
 
06:00:15.350 --> 06:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
look at the 16 uh under 16 and then 16
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
to 17 year olds there are certificates
 
06:00:20.670 --> 06:00:20.680 align:start position:0%
that um parents Andor school districts
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
um can have to complete when youth are
 
06:00:26.390 --> 06:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
working uh and then or the or the
 
06:00:28.310 --> 06:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
parental permissions so there is a there
 
06:00:31.190 --> 06:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
are um Provisions in place that address
 
06:00:33.868 --> 06:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
uh that type of a
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
parental permission and in some times
 
06:00:37.868 --> 06:00:37.878 align:start position:0%
it's School District permission as well
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
again dependent upon what age category
 
06:00:42.190 --> 06:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
you're in I'll just briefly add to that
 
06:00:44.430 --> 06:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the permissions relate to the
 
06:00:46.030 --> 06:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
overall employment they don't relate to
 
06:00:48.190 --> 06:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
there's no um permissions for specific
 
06:00:50.670 --> 06:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
work hours or to work in excess of those
 
06:00:53.628 --> 06:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
hours it's just about can can the youth
 
06:00:56.350 --> 06:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
work in this particular place or not
 
06:00:57.788 --> 06:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the clarification and if
 
06:00:59.150 --> 06:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
you could fill out a pink card before
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
you go that' be great rosett proud uh
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so I represent
 
06:01:07.270 --> 06:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
Hudson the board town with m Metts um If
 
06:01:09.030 --> 06:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
an employer has two locations one in
 
06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
Mass one in New Hampshire um could a
 
06:01:13.230 --> 06:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
youth have different rules depending on
 
06:01:14.628 --> 06:01:14.638 align:start position:0%
which location they're scheduled to work
 
06:01:16.430 --> 06:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
at uh how would that work would it be
 
06:01:18.110 --> 06:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
the employment relationship where
 
06:01:19.948 --> 06:01:19.958 align:start position:0%
whichever location they're hired would
 
06:01:21.628 --> 06:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
it depend on their schedule which rules
 
06:01:24.430 --> 06:01:24.440 align:start position:0%
apply can you clarify any of that at all
 
06:01:26.628 --> 06:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
I I can try I believe what you're asking
 
06:01:29.350 --> 06:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
is um If an employer has a location in
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then another one in
 
06:01:32.468 --> 06:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
another State's
 
06:01:35.270 --> 06:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction um are you asking if the
 
06:01:37.030 --> 06:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
youth employ employees working at both
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
locations what does the employer have to
 
06:01:41.868 --> 06:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
do yes essentially if the employee has
 
06:01:43.468 --> 06:01:43.478 align:start position:0%
sometimes picks up is assigned a shift
 
06:01:45.230 --> 06:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire location sometimes
 
06:01:46.468 --> 06:01:46.478 align:start position:0%
signed a shift to the Massachusetts
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
location does the rules follow the
 
06:01:50.590 --> 06:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
employment relationship does it follow
 
06:01:52.788 --> 06:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
the schedule of location how does that
 
06:01:55.030 --> 06:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
work yeah that's a very good question so
 
06:01:56.468 --> 06:01:56.478 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's jurisdiction would
 
06:01:58.110 --> 06:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
track to the work that's being performed
 
06:02:00.430 --> 06:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um more likely than not
 
06:02:01.750 --> 06:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
and I'm not familiar with their
 
06:02:01.760 --> 06:02:03.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm not familiar with their
requirements

06:02:03.110 --> 06:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
06:02:05.150 --> 06:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts requirements would track
 
06:02:08.190 --> 06:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
to the employment that's being um uh
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's being undone in
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts thank you all represent
 
06:02:17.230 --> 06:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you uh Mr
 
06:02:20.030 --> 06:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
chair a couple of things were uh that
 
06:02:21.548 --> 06:02:21.558 align:start position:0%
were raised during the hearing the first
 
06:02:23.628 --> 06:02:23.638 align:start position:0%
thing is as it relates to this kind of
 
06:02:25.548 --> 06:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
drift that people supposed to end
 
06:02:28.310 --> 06:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
certain time and they kind of drift off
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that that would be the first and
 
06:02:33.548 --> 06:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
then is it the if I could just roll it
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
together if if the um is is it the
 
06:02:39.510 --> 06:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
position of the do that you're worried
 
06:02:42.110 --> 06:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
about 2 or 3 minutes or 5 minutes is
 
06:02:44.910 --> 06:02:44.920 align:start position:0%
that do you generally uh get aggressive
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that that kind of
 
06:02:49.150 --> 06:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
performance yeah I um if I understand
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
the question you're asking how does the
 
06:02:53.150 --> 06:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
department view scenarios where um a
 
06:02:55.670 --> 06:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
youth has worked a couple of minutes up
 
06:02:57.030 --> 06:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
up to maybe five if I understood
 
06:02:59.150 --> 06:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
correctly beyond the prescribed time
 
06:03:01.510 --> 06:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
frames by Statute um it really does
 
06:03:04.350 --> 06:03:04.360 align:start position:0%
depend and I I it's a very fact
 
06:03:06.510 --> 06:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
dependent inquiry so you know I think
 
06:03:09.548 --> 06:03:09.558 align:start position:0%
the department is generally pretty good
 
06:03:11.868 --> 06:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
about um you know one engaging with
 
06:03:14.430 --> 06:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
employers if it is a time or two there's
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
no real pattern or practice of it um
 
06:03:18.230 --> 06:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's something we may engage on it may
 
06:03:21.070 --> 06:03:21.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily um rise to the level or
 
06:03:23.270 --> 06:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
get cited as a super you know as a heavy
 
06:03:26.110 --> 06:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
civil um penalty you know violation if
 
06:03:27.830 --> 06:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
there's a pattern in a practice of it if
 
06:03:29.670 --> 06:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of complaints related
 
06:03:31.868 --> 06:03:31.878 align:start position:0%
to it um it would depend on a whole host
 
06:03:33.628 --> 06:03:33.638 align:start position:0%
of different facts and circumstances
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
attendant to that uh situation
 
06:03:38.270 --> 06:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
for the Department to determine whether
 
06:03:41.390 --> 06:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
or not you know five minutes is rising
 
06:03:42.830 --> 06:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
to the level of something that we are
 
06:03:45.310 --> 06:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
concerned about concerned about you know
 
06:03:49.510 --> 06:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
for um more more um stronger more
 
06:03:52.390 --> 06:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
strenuous uh perhaps enforcement
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
actions okay thank you so much
 
06:03:59.590 --> 06:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
um the school
 
06:04:07.350 --> 06:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
year um if a 16 or 17 only has one class
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
given that there's a lot of you know
 
06:04:10.990 --> 06:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
schedule Shifting the front load you
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
know freshman J you guys get it um would
 
06:04:16.510 --> 06:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
the employee be penalized for having
 
06:04:19.548 --> 06:04:19.558 align:start position:0%
them work that's a very good question so
 
06:04:22.350 --> 06:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
the language relative to when school and
 
06:04:24.628 --> 06:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
in session has been struck and the
 
06:04:27.150 --> 06:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
language as draft is talking about the
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
date on which the school year begins and
 
06:04:31.270 --> 06:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the date in which the school year ends
 
06:04:34.430 --> 06:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
it does make notation um for other than
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
a week you know the school's vacation
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
week um but arguably it could be
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
interpreted that if you're between that
 
06:04:42.830 --> 06:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
start and that end date you've got to
 
06:04:44.830 --> 06:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
abide by uh the requirements as set
 
06:04:47.910 --> 06:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
forth in the the 35h hour um requirement
 
06:04:49.910 --> 06:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
provision as set forth in that language
 
06:04:51.788 --> 06:04:51.798 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chairman yes sir how would you
 
06:04:53.310 --> 06:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
how would that transfer over to a
 
06:04:55.628 --> 06:04:55.638 align:start position:0%
private or or a charter school if they
 
06:04:58.030 --> 06:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
have a differing school vacation weeks
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
it would be contingent upon one I
 
06:05:01.468 --> 06:05:01.478 align:start position:0%
believe the owners would be on the
 
06:05:03.150 --> 06:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
employer to assure that they are
 
06:05:05.868 --> 06:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
grabbing or take U accessing or finding
 
06:05:09.708 --> 06:05:09.718 align:start position:0%
asking for the relevant schools calendar
 
06:05:11.468 --> 06:05:11.478 align:start position:0%
or sessions whether that's access I know
 
06:05:13.030 --> 06:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are accessible online I
 
06:05:14.310 --> 06:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
don't know about private or Charter
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
Schools how they post those things um
 
06:05:17.948 --> 06:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
there would be an onus I believe on the
 
06:05:20.150 --> 06:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
employer to obtain that and then to
 
06:05:21.468 --> 06:05:21.478 align:start position:0%
assure that they have an understanding
 
06:05:23.110 --> 06:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
of it so that they're being mindful that
 
06:05:26.110 --> 06:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
the 35 hours within that time frame or
 
06:05:28.868 --> 06:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
48 if it's during the summertime um is
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
is being abided by and then FAL followup
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yep how would you deal with
 
06:05:35.868 --> 06:05:35.878 align:start position:0%
this with homeschoolers
 
06:05:37.990 --> 06:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
excellent question so with homeschoolers
 
06:05:40.510 --> 06:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
it would very much be um the same the
 
06:05:43.270 --> 06:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
employer you know should arguably check
 
06:05:44.830 --> 06:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
with the homeschooled student Andor
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
their parents are usually the ones
 
06:05:48.510 --> 06:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
administering a homeschool program when
 
06:05:51.270 --> 06:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
is your school year starting and ending
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
um in you know in general in the
 
06:05:53.868 --> 06:05:53.878 align:start position:0%
department has testified to this effect
 
06:05:55.948 --> 06:05:55.958 align:start position:0%
in the past if the employer doesn't have
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
that information or it's not accessible
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
uh we do turn an eye towards the
 
06:06:02.350 --> 06:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
calendar of the school district where
 
06:06:03.948 --> 06:06:03.958 align:start position:0%
the youth is
 
06:06:06.190 --> 06:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
domiciled and represent
 
06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
proud thank
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chairman um so just
 
06:06:14.070 --> 06:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
following up on that and clarifying when
 
06:06:16.590 --> 06:06:16.600 align:start position:0%
this refers to the school year in this
 
06:06:19.110 --> 06:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
bill it's the school year specifically
 
06:06:21.310 --> 06:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
the youth employee not necessarily the
 
06:06:23.430 --> 06:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
school year of the public school
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
district or or anything else it's it can
 
06:06:28.190 --> 06:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
be a specific to each individual
 
06:06:30.628 --> 06:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
employee evaluation that's that's how
 
06:06:32.830 --> 06:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
the department understands the language
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
um again if Hudson School District
 
06:06:38.350 --> 06:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
starts on August 15th and ends because
 
06:06:43.030 --> 06:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
of snow days that they called on um June
 
06:06:45.230 --> 06:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
22nd that would be the start and end of
 
06:06:46.708 --> 06:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
the school year if you've got another
 
06:06:48.468 --> 06:06:48.478 align:start position:0%
student who were who goes to conquered
 
06:06:50.110 --> 06:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
and conquered started on the same day
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
but ended earlier because they had less
 
06:06:53.190 --> 06:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
snow days that their start and their end
 
06:06:55.590 --> 06:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
dates would be different thank
 
06:06:59.230 --> 06:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
you represent aani thank you Mr chairman
 
06:07:01.990 --> 06:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
if you are 16 or 17 and you're a junior
 
06:07:06.150 --> 06:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
or senior and you are out on um a work
 
06:07:08.030 --> 06:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
program sometimes in a trade school
 
06:07:10.910 --> 06:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
you'll class one week how would that
 
06:07:13.708 --> 06:07:13.718 align:start position:0%
square with working more than 35 hours
 
06:07:15.430 --> 06:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
in the week that you're in technically
 
06:07:17.548 --> 06:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
shop that's an excellent question when
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
you reference excuse me work program do
 
06:07:21.468 --> 06:07:21.478 align:start position:0%
you mean the approved um Educational
 
06:07:23.708 --> 06:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity programs um those
 
06:07:26.030 --> 06:07:26.040 align:start position:0%
are approved through the
 
06:07:28.510 --> 06:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
department um
 
06:07:31.190 --> 06:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
I might want to go back and make sure
 
06:07:33.030 --> 06:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
that I look at the language in
 
06:07:35.708 --> 06:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
27922 AA to make certain that I'm not
 
06:07:37.948 --> 06:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
missing anything um I think the hour
 
06:07:40.830 --> 06:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
requirements could still arguably apply
 
06:07:43.830 --> 06:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
U the 35 hours um the 35 hours that are
 
06:07:46.390 --> 06:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
referenced in that Pro the provision
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral VI um but if that is okay
 
06:07:51.788 --> 06:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't mind looking at the language
 
06:07:53.868 --> 06:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
in 279 just to assure I'm not missing
 
06:07:55.430 --> 06:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
anything and and providing a written
 
06:07:58.350 --> 06:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
followup if that's okay with you and and
 
06:08:00.270 --> 06:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
follow with chairman yes and also the
 
06:08:01.910 --> 06:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
next section as well if they're limited
 
06:08:04.708 --> 06:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
to that 9:00 p.m. and or 11:00 p.m. yes
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
um cuz I know our industry typically
 
06:08:10.430 --> 06:08:10.440 align:start position:0%

new

06:09:52.670 --> 06:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
new
 
06:09:59.468 --> 06:09:59.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:02.350 --> 06:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
757 I believe I'm although I've I've
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
handled out handed out a bunch of copies
 
06:10:07.230 --> 06:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm missing I'm missing one more
 
06:10:09.750 --> 06:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
document which is key to this it's the
 
06:10:13.510 --> 06:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's the U document that I I prepared uh
 
06:10:16.390 --> 06:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
I found on the internet about how one
 
06:10:16.400 --> 06:10:17.350 align:start position:0%
I found on the internet about how one
goes

06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
goes
 
06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
about uh with tip sharing and tip
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
pooling ways that it is done as no
 
06:10:25.910 --> 06:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's not it that's an article about
 
06:10:28.190 --> 06:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
the law that was changed and how that's
 
06:10:32.110 --> 06:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
the other situation so I I apologize if
 
06:10:34.150 --> 06:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
I I will find it an email to you but it
 
06:10:36.270 --> 06:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
explains is it sort of a guide of how
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
you might explain in your restaurant we
 
06:10:41.590 --> 06:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
we do tip pooling this way that way
 
06:10:43.788 --> 06:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
these are the percentag as a guideline
 
06:10:46.948 --> 06:10:46.958 align:start position:0%
which I provided during the testimony on
 
06:10:50.948 --> 06:10:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh S sp269 A couple of years ago and as
 
06:10:50.958 --> 06:10:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh S sp269 A couple of years ago and as
I

06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:10:54.350 --> 06:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
recall uh Mr Summers said this is this
 
06:10:56.590 --> 06:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
is great this is a good document this is
 
06:10:58.390 --> 06:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is what our attorneys recommend we
 
06:11:01.070 --> 06:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
do and explaining to our people so that
 
06:11:02.510 --> 06:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
they understand what their rights and
 
06:11:06.070 --> 06:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are that uh there it's
 
06:11:08.390 --> 06:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
a voluntary situation there is no
 
06:11:11.510 --> 06:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
coercion at all uh they and their their
 
06:11:14.110 --> 06:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues will will have this pool or
 
06:11:16.270 --> 06:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
tip sharing whatever the arrangement is
 
06:11:18.270 --> 06:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
and the employer will merely administer
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
it uh and all of this explains it very
 
06:11:23.590 --> 06:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
very well we just don't want you to tell
 
06:11:26.868 --> 06:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
us to do it because that's a
 
06:11:30.030 --> 06:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
burden and I I'm really think that if
 
06:11:31.868 --> 06:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
you have the document and you did
 
06:11:33.468 --> 06:11:33.478 align:start position:0%
explain it to the employee and they know
 
06:11:35.270 --> 06:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
everything there is to know before they
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
begin and they sign that document I
 
06:11:40.628 --> 06:11:40.638 align:start position:0%
think this gives you some uh lot of a
 
06:11:43.628 --> 06:11:43.638 align:start position:0%
magic amulet in and against an employee
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
saying well no I was coerced I didn't
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
understand what I was getting into I
 
06:11:49.430 --> 06:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
think this is actually a good thing for
 
06:11:51.548 --> 06:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
the employer and the employee which is
 
06:11:53.868 --> 06:11:53.878 align:start position:0%
what I strive for here on the best
 
06:11:55.628 --> 06:11:55.638 align:start position:0%
Committee in in the legislature the
 
06:11:55.638 --> 06:11:56.750 align:start position:0%
Committee in in the legislature the
labor

06:11:56.750 --> 06:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
labor
 
06:12:00.150 --> 06:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee so uh in the other part of the
 
06:12:01.990 --> 06:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
bill I mean I I do think that people
 
06:12:03.230 --> 06:12:03.240 align:start position:0%
should know what they're getting into
 
06:12:05.430 --> 06:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
and understand what happens to their
 
06:12:06.670 --> 06:12:06.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have they have to share them
 
06:12:08.430 --> 06:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
with the bartender the hostess the
 
06:12:11.310 --> 06:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
butcher the baker the Candlestick maker
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh but the other part of the bill that
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
was concerning to me was that we change
 
06:12:17.910 --> 06:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
was changed uh service charges are no
 
06:12:19.390 --> 06:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
longer considered
 
06:12:22.948 --> 06:12:22.958 align:start position:0%
tips and we were told that the IRS was
 
06:12:27.030 --> 06:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
taxing the businesses on these service
 
06:12:30.670 --> 06:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
charges after we got over our shock we
 
06:12:32.270 --> 06:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh we agreed that with that shouldn't
 
06:12:34.430 --> 06:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
happen and that was not income to the
 
06:12:37.750 --> 06:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
business but I read this article here um
 
06:12:41.190 --> 06:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
from Autumn click and Aaron Rosenberg at
 
06:12:43.910 --> 06:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
sheenny and they kind of said that the
 
06:12:45.910 --> 06:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
tips are going toward the
 
06:12:48.310 --> 06:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
employers and that was very unsettling
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
in fact I reached out to uh Miss click
 
06:12:53.948 --> 06:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
and I even spoke to uh Jame Rey James
 
06:12:56.670 --> 06:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
Rey about this it was very concerning to
 
06:12:58.510 --> 06:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
me and I I think that when you go out to
 
06:13:00.548 --> 06:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
dinner you're you know not a member of
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
this labor committee and even we were
 
06:13:04.590 --> 06:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
taking back back uh and it says service
 
06:13:07.110 --> 06:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
charge we we think that's for service
 
06:13:09.708 --> 06:13:09.718 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's like for the for
 
06:13:12.548 --> 06:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
the people providing the service so I
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a little misleading that if
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
you're presented with something that
 
06:13:18.270 --> 06:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
says service charges and you think it's
 
06:13:21.190 --> 06:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
going to the servers uh maybe you're not
 
06:13:24.270 --> 06:13:24.280 align:start position:0%
going to tip the servers because it's a
 
06:13:25.750 --> 06:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
service charge and you thought they're
 
06:13:27.548 --> 06:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
getting it but then they're not getting
 
06:13:29.110 --> 06:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
it because it goes to the
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
employer so I think this should be uh I
 
06:13:35.430 --> 06:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
think the the business the the employ
 
06:13:37.868 --> 06:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
should be uh transparent with the
 
06:13:39.750 --> 06:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
customers as well as with the with their
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
staff and saying well this is a service
 
06:13:44.030 --> 06:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
charge or an admin fee whatever you want
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
to call it and it's going for this or it
 
06:13:50.750 --> 06:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
says that the employer has a choice they
 
06:13:53.230 --> 06:13:53.240 align:start position:0%
can distribute the service charge as if
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
it were a tip well they could say well
 
06:13:58.708 --> 06:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
somewhat of this is going to your server
 
06:14:00.270 --> 06:14:00.280 align:start position:0%
I think that would be information that
 
06:14:03.468 --> 06:14:03.478 align:start position:0%
would be uh important for the customer
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
to know I and I think it the interest of
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
transparency and fairness uh I think
 
06:14:11.310 --> 06:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
both start both sections of this uh bill
 
06:14:13.390 --> 06:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:14:16.430 --> 06:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
adopted and there you have it all right
 
06:14:22.750 --> 06:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:24.910 --> 06:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
questions go home early you're off the
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
hook yep thank you
 
06:14:36.150 --> 06:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:36.160 --> 06:14:38.948 align:start position:0%
 
thank

06:14:38.948 --> 06:14:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Mr chairman members
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Mike
 
06:14:43.548 --> 06:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
Summers president CEO of the New
 
06:14:44.590 --> 06:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lodging and Restaurant
 
06:14:46.548 --> 06:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
Association um surprisingly we were
 
06:14:48.750 --> 06:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh House Bill
 
06:14:50.830 --> 06:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
757 um certainly appreciate what
 
06:14:52.830 --> 06:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative kahill is trying to do uh
 
06:14:54.628 --> 06:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
particularly in section uh the first
 
06:14:57.548 --> 06:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
part of the bill um allowing for uh
 
06:15:00.190 --> 06:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
business to have in writing what the tip
 
06:15:01.948 --> 06:15:01.958 align:start position:0%
pooling Arrangement or tip sharing
 
06:15:05.110 --> 06:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
Arrangement might be I think we're we're
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit concerned is that um you
 
06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
know if it's required to be in writing
 
06:15:13.270 --> 06:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
and when does that get reviewed how
 
06:15:14.468 --> 06:15:14.478 align:start position:0%
often can it
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
change what happens if an employee gets
 
06:15:18.350 --> 06:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
confused about which version of the
 
06:15:21.190 --> 06:15:21.200 align:start position:0%
agreement is in place today or next week
 
06:15:23.030 --> 06:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
so I think there's just some things in
 
06:15:24.670 --> 06:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
there that we're not really sure exactly
 
06:15:27.190 --> 06:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
how that would like operate in the real
 
06:15:27.200 --> 06:15:29.350 align:start position:0%
how that would like operate in the real
world

06:15:29.350 --> 06:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
world
 
06:15:31.990 --> 06:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and then obviously if if uh an
 
06:15:33.510 --> 06:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
employee does get confused about which
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
one is in place uh the business then
 
06:15:37.190 --> 06:15:37.200 align:start position:0%
open to a complaint to the Department of
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
Labor and then sanctions etc etc
 
06:15:45.510 --> 06:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
um frankly I think the better solution
 
06:15:48.030 --> 06:15:48.040 align:start position:0%
for this problem it's not a popular
 
06:15:50.270 --> 06:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
opinion but I'll share it with you uh
 
06:15:52.190 --> 06:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
under federal law the business is
 
06:15:54.468 --> 06:15:54.478 align:start position:0%
allowed to set whatever a tip out policy
 
06:15:56.628 --> 06:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
might be uh We've advocated for that for
 
06:15:58.868 --> 06:15:58.878 align:start position:0%
a number of years and this committee has
 
06:16:01.548 --> 06:16:01.558 align:start position:0%
uh summarily uh disposed of those uh
 
06:16:03.390 --> 06:16:03.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions but if we were going to make
 
06:16:04.948 --> 06:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
a change in this section of the statute
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think that's what it should be that
 
06:16:07.750 --> 06:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
the business owner can set what a tip
 
06:16:10.190 --> 06:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
out policy should be provided that is
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable and customary which is the
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal standard um and if we were to
 
06:16:15.548 --> 06:16:15.558 align:start position:0%
adopt that I think that would clean up a
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the problems that we have uh
 
06:16:21.350 --> 06:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
within the industry um and then the
 
06:16:25.468 --> 06:16:25.478 align:start position:0%
service charge language um frankly uh it
 
06:16:27.230 --> 06:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
is our understanding and I'm interested
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
to read the article that representative
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
kill has presented here that a service
 
06:16:33.990 --> 06:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
charge as far as the IRS is concerned is
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
considered income of the business and
 
06:16:38.190 --> 06:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
therefore taxable under federal law and
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
in that case we feel that that if if
 
06:16:41.548 --> 06:16:41.558 align:start position:0%
we're going to be paying taxes on it we
 
06:16:43.230 --> 06:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to decide how that money
 
06:16:45.830 --> 06:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
is then distributed and used um now I
 
06:16:47.948 --> 06:16:47.958 align:start position:0%
will concede that some businesses will
 
06:16:49.510 --> 06:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
take a portion of that service charge
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
and will give it to employee employees
 
06:16:53.830 --> 06:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
so for example if you go to a wedding
 
06:16:56.070 --> 06:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
and a wedding has a 20% service charge
 
06:16:58.390 --> 06:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
on the entirety of the event you know
 
06:17:00.788 --> 06:17:00.798 align:start position:0%
probably 15% of that service charge is
 
06:17:02.390 --> 06:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
likely being divvied up amongst all the
 
06:17:03.868 --> 06:17:03.878 align:start position:0%
various people that provided service
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
during the course of that event that's
 
06:17:07.670 --> 06:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
just the industry standard so in some
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
instances that's the case but I think
 
06:17:10.548 --> 06:17:10.558 align:start position:0%
that should be at the discretion of the
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
business since we're already paying
 
06:17:14.030 --> 06:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
taxes on those monies if that makes
 
06:17:17.150 --> 06:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
sense um and then in in a restaurant
 
06:17:18.430 --> 06:17:18.440 align:start position:0%
setting I think where we're a little bit
 
06:17:20.310 --> 06:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
concerned is we now have to break out
 
06:17:22.468 --> 06:17:22.478 align:start position:0%
how the service charge might be
 
06:17:24.910 --> 06:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
allocated exactly how is that going to
 
06:17:26.990 --> 06:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
work and who's going to police it and
 
06:17:29.230 --> 06:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
then if we don't do it correctly or it's
 
06:17:31.948 --> 06:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
incorrect to the way we used we handled
 
06:17:34.390 --> 06:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
the service charge today uh what's the
 
06:17:36.390 --> 06:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
penalty structure I think there's a lot
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
of confusion on our part of exactly how
 
06:17:41.548 --> 06:17:41.558 align:start position:0%
that would be handled um you know who is
 
06:17:43.590 --> 06:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to come in and audit our receipts
 
06:17:45.070 --> 06:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh in a restaurant if we have an
 
06:17:46.510 --> 06:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
automatic service charge on a party of
 
06:17:48.628 --> 06:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
eight people who's going to do that how
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
long do we have to keep the records um
 
06:17:52.390 --> 06:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
and then you know what's the penalty
 
06:17:54.030 --> 06:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
structure if if somebody's not in
 
06:17:55.948 --> 06:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
compliance and how detailed does it need
 
06:17:57.670 --> 06:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
to be do we need to allocate a
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
percentage to electricity a percentage
 
06:18:02.030 --> 06:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
to uh kitchen staff a percentage to
 
06:18:04.150 --> 06:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be so I think there's
 
06:18:07.390 --> 06:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of unknowns in how that is uh is
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
that is structured so with that I will
 
06:18:11.468 --> 06:18:11.478 align:start position:0%
end and be happy to try well I guess I
 
06:18:13.430 --> 06:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
should also add service charges are not
 
06:18:15.590 --> 06:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
uncommon in the business world I think
 
06:18:17.310 --> 06:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
everyone just gets excited about the
 
06:18:19.548 --> 06:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
hospitality industry because you know a
 
06:18:21.110 --> 06:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people just assume that maybe it
 
06:18:24.110 --> 06:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
should be for uh a tip or a gratuiti but
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
I get service charges for at the car
 
06:18:27.628 --> 06:18:27.638 align:start position:0%
dealership when I get worked out on my
 
06:18:29.830 --> 06:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
car I've had uh service charges on my
 
06:18:32.230 --> 06:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
cell phone bill these service charges
 
06:18:34.788 --> 06:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
exist as a generic way to just charge
 
06:18:38.230 --> 06:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
fees for services so uh and I'm I don't
 
06:18:40.070 --> 06:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
I don't assume that all of those service
 
06:18:41.350 --> 06:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
charges are then passed through to the
 
06:18:43.510 --> 06:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
employees I mean it may be in a
 
06:18:45.910 --> 06:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
roundabout way because it's in wages or
 
06:18:47.548 --> 06:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be but I again I think
 
06:18:48.948 --> 06:18:48.958 align:start position:0%
that should be at the discretion of the
 
06:18:51.230 --> 06:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
employer so with that I will end and I'm
 
06:18:52.548 --> 06:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer any questions
 
06:18:54.868 --> 06:18:54.878 align:start position:0%
represent avalani thank you Mr chairman
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr Summers
 
06:19:02.230 --> 06:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
um for this sections of line 6 through
 
06:19:07.270 --> 06:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
10 um right now we are supposed to have
 
06:19:11.310 --> 06:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
employees sign a health certificate for
 
06:19:13.750 --> 06:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
the food Protection
 
06:19:17.910 --> 06:19:17.920 align:start position:0%
Services um and we would get dinged if
 
06:19:20.030 --> 06:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
we didn't have an if we hired we onboard
 
06:19:21.430 --> 06:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
an employee and forgot to forgot to have
 
06:19:23.230 --> 06:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
him sign that thing we would get dinged
 
06:19:25.510 --> 06:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
as well um you also
 
06:19:27.590 --> 06:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned if you have if I have a 100
 
06:19:30.628 --> 06:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
waitresses or 100 weight staff now all
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
of a sudden I'm missing one am I going
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be subject to fine am I going to be
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
subject to action by the do because a
 
06:19:41.150 --> 06:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
different employee complained about it I
 
06:19:42.708 --> 06:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
would defer to the department on that
 
06:19:44.590 --> 06:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
but ultimately my suspicion would be
 
06:19:46.390 --> 06:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
that you would have corrective action 30
 
06:19:48.150 --> 06:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
days and then penalties would follow
 
06:19:52.788 --> 06:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
thereafter um but again uh as as many of
 
06:19:55.110 --> 06:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
you may know and maybe some don't but
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
you know at the rate which employees
 
06:19:58.430 --> 06:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
turn over in our industry just keeping
 
06:20:00.270 --> 06:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
track of this would need a almost a
 
06:20:02.230 --> 06:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
full-time position just to make sure
 
06:20:03.990 --> 06:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
everyone had their stuff in their files
 
06:20:05.708 --> 06:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
I mean it's bad enough now but to just
 
06:20:07.670 --> 06:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
add another layer to that follow up Mr
 
06:20:10.030 --> 06:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up U relating to service
 
06:20:13.910 --> 06:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
charges um a lot of uh businesses are
 
06:20:15.948 --> 06:20:15.958 align:start position:0%
now passing through credit credit card
 
06:20:18.628 --> 06:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
fees as a service charge when somebody
 
06:20:21.150 --> 06:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
uses their credit card correct and I
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
think that we changed we adjusted the
 
06:20:25.390 --> 06:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
wording so we wouldn't get dinged on
 
06:20:28.788 --> 06:20:28.798 align:start position:0%
that and this would bring it back to so
 
06:20:30.830 --> 06:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
if if you remember uh prior to the
 
06:20:31.910 --> 06:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
change I think it was in the last
 
06:20:34.150 --> 06:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
legislative session uh prior to that in
 
06:20:35.910 --> 06:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
the def definition of a tip it listed
 
06:20:37.708 --> 06:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
service charge so if you charged a
 
06:20:39.150 --> 06:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
service charge and it just said service
 
06:20:41.070 --> 06:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
charge technically it was a gratuiti and
 
06:20:43.070 --> 06:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
therefore 100% of it had to go to the
 
06:20:44.750 --> 06:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
employees and businesses would have been
 
06:20:47.350 --> 06:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
dinged on that um with the change we
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
made we removed it as part of the
 
06:20:51.070 --> 06:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
definition so then ultimately because I
 
06:20:52.590 --> 06:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
think the statute's silent on what a
 
06:20:54.548 --> 06:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
service charge is I think now it becomes
 
06:20:56.190 --> 06:20:56.200 align:start position:0%
property the employer and therefore they
 
06:20:58.390 --> 06:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
can use it as they see fit to pay credit
 
06:21:01.230 --> 06:21:01.240 align:start position:0%
card fees uh or any other ancillary
 
06:21:02.750 --> 06:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
costs that have have risen dramatically
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
over the last few years thank you Mr
 
06:21:07.070 --> 06:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr B any other
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions represent Mackenzie sir thank
 
06:21:13.510 --> 06:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
you um enforcing labor laws is difficult
 
06:21:15.430 --> 06:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways that we have been
 
06:21:18.190 --> 06:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
able to um alert people to what their
 
06:21:21.270 --> 06:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
rights are is pla cards would you be
 
06:21:23.750 --> 06:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a plard which details
 
06:21:25.830 --> 06:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
what what the provisions are under the
 
06:21:31.150 --> 06:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
pooling so that all ahead of time I
 
06:21:36.310 --> 06:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
you're you're essentially referring to
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
all the wage and hour stuff we have to
 
06:21:40.468 --> 06:21:40.478 align:start position:0%
have posted in our businesses um not
 
06:21:41.910 --> 06:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily I mean we have to do that
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
for a variety of other areas anyway um I
 
06:21:46.230 --> 06:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
think the issue we would have is that as
 
06:21:48.030 --> 06:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
rapidly as this committee changes those
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
rules uh we'd be printing these things
 
06:21:54.868 --> 06:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:58.788 --> 06:21:58.798 align:start position:0%
basis fair enough all right uh represent
 
06:22:02.468 --> 06:22:02.478 align:start position:0%
McKenzie or um G ring sorry thank you Mr
 
06:22:04.190 --> 06:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
chair so just to confirm I want to
 
06:22:05.670 --> 06:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate at this it sounds like you
 
06:22:07.190 --> 06:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
would be adding to businesses
 
06:22:09.510 --> 06:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
administrative costs training costs and
 
06:22:10.868 --> 06:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
several other costs that would be
 
06:22:13.788 --> 06:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
accured for moving this forward yeah and
 
06:22:15.670 --> 06:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
primarily because when it comes to wage
 
06:22:17.150 --> 06:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
and hour the top 10 wage and hour
 
06:22:19.510 --> 06:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
violations in our industry tip sharing
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
and pooling and the management thereof
 
06:22:23.350 --> 06:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
is probably the maybe not number one but
 
06:22:25.468 --> 06:22:25.478 align:start position:0%
it's way up there on the top of the list
 
06:22:26.830 --> 06:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
um and this would just add another layer
 
06:22:28.548 --> 06:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
of complexity to it and I I feel that
 
06:22:30.350 --> 06:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
that would just be a huge issue
 
06:22:33.628 --> 06:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you representative K
 
06:22:35.190 --> 06:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
you and Mr
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
today thank you last and certainly least
 
06:22:55.670 --> 06:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh John garrian general counsel for the
 
06:22:57.670 --> 06:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor with me is Deputy
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Daniel Albert um department
 
06:23:04.510 --> 06:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
is neutral on the bill uh as Mr Summers
 
06:23:06.910 --> 06:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
said we we do frequently run into and
 
06:23:09.070 --> 06:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
enforce and investigate and sight tip
 
06:23:11.430 --> 06:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
pooling and tip sharing
 
06:23:11.440 --> 06:23:13.070 align:start position:0%
pooling and tip sharing
violations

06:23:13.070 --> 06:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
violations
 
06:23:16.270 --> 06:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
um uh our our One technical suggestion
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
on the bill is with the proposed
 
06:23:22.110 --> 06:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
language um and what we find in our
 
06:23:26.670 --> 06:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases is uh the line between
 
06:23:27.670 --> 06:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
um an
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
employer um providing notice of an
 
06:23:32.750 --> 06:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
arrangement or educating staff on an
 
06:23:35.190 --> 06:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
arrangement um or making suggestions
 
06:23:36.670 --> 06:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
about an arrangement or what the
 
06:23:39.270 --> 06:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
employer perceives as making suggestions
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
about that Arrangement and then what an
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
employee May perceive as coercion into
 
06:23:48.230 --> 06:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
that Arrangement that's a very fine line
 
06:23:49.670 --> 06:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
it can be very it's it's very much a
 
06:23:54.590 --> 06:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
gray area um our concern is that adding
 
06:23:59.990 --> 06:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
more kind of twists and turns into that
 
06:24:03.788 --> 06:24:03.798 align:start position:0%
um process will create more confusion
 
06:24:05.990 --> 06:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps more
 
06:24:08.310 --> 06:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
misconceptions um more perceived
 
06:24:10.230 --> 06:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
coercion and frankly kind of stickier
 
06:24:13.628 --> 06:24:13.638 align:start position:0%
situations for us to try to to
 
06:24:18.628 --> 06:24:18.638 align:start position:0%
unravel um so in terms of the uh service
 
06:24:21.430 --> 06:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
charge provision um as Mr summer said I
 
06:24:23.190 --> 06:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
believe two years ago the the term
 
06:24:24.628 --> 06:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
service charge was removed from the
 
06:24:26.750 --> 06:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
definition of tip in order to to more to
 
06:24:29.548 --> 06:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
clarify what was a tip and what is not a
 
06:24:32.270 --> 06:24:32.280 align:start position:0%
tip um that was in response to several
 
06:24:35.310 --> 06:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
cases we had where um service charges
 
06:24:37.468 --> 06:24:37.478 align:start position:0%
were being were being charged and then
 
06:24:38.948 --> 06:24:38.958 align:start position:0%
not turning into tips and and that
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
turned into to Major violations so uh
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
our concern there is that um adding that
 
06:24:47.708 --> 06:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
term kind of back into the mix in what
 
06:24:49.750 --> 06:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
might be a tip I think may lead to
 
06:24:52.310 --> 06:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
confusion though I I will I will say the
 
06:24:53.788 --> 06:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
this proposed language is a much more
 
06:24:55.430 --> 06:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
specific definition and has much more
 
06:24:57.670 --> 06:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
specific rules than the prior use of the
 
06:25:00.868 --> 06:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
phrase service charge within the
 
06:25:03.548 --> 06:25:03.558 align:start position:0%
statutes um but with that I'll take any
 
06:25:07.310 --> 06:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:09.670 --> 06:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
represent L thank you Mr chairman thank
 
06:25:12.788 --> 06:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
you Mr garan um line four to include an
 
06:25:14.350 --> 06:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
example of said practice could you
 
06:25:17.468 --> 06:25:17.478 align:start position:0%
define that for me as an
 
06:25:20.190 --> 06:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
employer it is not defined in the bill
 
06:25:21.628 --> 06:25:21.638 align:start position:0%
and I can't think of a similar
 
06:25:23.430 --> 06:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
definition that would apply in in the
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor statutes thank you
 
06:25:29.390 --> 06:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
follow Mr chairman please um I asked the
 
06:25:31.670 --> 06:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Summers the same question as if an
 
06:25:34.468 --> 06:25:34.478 align:start position:0%
employee was missed on the signing a
 
06:25:37.110 --> 06:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
written notice would the department be
 
06:25:38.990 --> 06:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
um uh obviously that would be a
 
06:25:40.070 --> 06:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
violation and then it would be
 
06:25:41.430 --> 06:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
corrective action but if it was
 
06:25:42.548 --> 06:25:42.558 align:start position:0%
concurrent you know there's a lot of
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
turnover Within These some of these
 
06:25:46.788 --> 06:25:46.798 align:start position:0%
places and and would it be a you know
 
06:25:48.230 --> 06:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
one or two names that are missing or
 
06:25:50.628 --> 06:25:50.638 align:start position:0%
something like that would would there
 
06:25:53.948 --> 06:25:53.958 align:start position:0%
be you know action of course it it could
 
06:25:56.270 --> 06:25:56.280 align:start position:0%
be the basis for for a violation I mean
 
06:26:00.110 --> 06:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
certainly if um we're we're very uh
 
06:26:01.830 --> 06:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
cognizant of the numbers of the
 
06:26:05.070 --> 06:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
practices I mean if certainly a a
 
06:26:07.350 --> 06:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
a restaurant as it were that had no
 
06:26:09.750 --> 06:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
written receipts whatsoever is in a very
 
06:26:10.948 --> 06:26:10.958 align:start position:0%
different position kind of an
 
06:26:13.030 --> 06:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement sense than restaurant maybe
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
one or two employees like short-term
 
06:26:16.788 --> 06:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
employers didn't sign I mean still a
 
06:26:20.788 --> 06:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
violation but apples and oranges please
 
06:26:23.510 --> 06:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
would that also open them up to other um
 
06:26:25.468 --> 06:26:25.478 align:start position:0%
investigations for payroll and whatnot
 
06:26:27.670 --> 06:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
but given that it is tip
 
06:26:31.230 --> 06:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
pooling uh it depending on what the the
 
06:26:32.830 --> 06:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
specific facts of the allegations and
 
06:26:34.990 --> 06:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
the complaint are it could
 
06:26:37.310 --> 06:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
yeah it could cause cause an audit to
 
06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
further records thank you thank you Mr
 
06:26:41.830 --> 06:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and represent McKenzie thank
 
06:26:45.708 --> 06:26:45.718 align:start position:0%
you uh in looking at the language it uh
 
06:26:47.548 --> 06:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
it would appear that the employee the
 
06:26:49.590 --> 06:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
burden is on the employee to a certain
 
06:26:51.990 --> 06:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
extent to know what their rights are and
 
06:26:56.030 --> 06:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
to um and to act
 
06:26:59.190 --> 06:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
proactively uh so what I don't
 
06:27:01.350 --> 06:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
understand is when a restaurant worker
 
06:27:02.708 --> 06:27:02.718 align:start position:0%
when somebody applies for a restaurant
 
06:27:04.510 --> 06:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
and they're hired by the restaurant this
 
06:27:06.390 --> 06:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
law affects them this law they are
 
06:27:08.110 --> 06:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
covered by this law and tip pooling
 
06:27:10.868 --> 06:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
correct how is that communicated and
 
06:27:14.430 --> 06:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
what what how can we document that those
 
06:27:16.750 --> 06:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of things have taken place because
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
as soon as they come through the door
 
06:27:19.788 --> 06:27:19.798 align:start position:0%
they could be going out that you know
 
06:27:22.150 --> 06:27:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's all that stuff we're working now
 
06:27:24.350 --> 06:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and so I'm I'm worried about that's why
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
I'm suggested the plet stuff yeah I mean
 
06:27:28.430 --> 06:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:27:30.270 --> 06:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
department to my knowledge doesn't have
 
06:27:32.510 --> 06:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
any laws requiring notice of this
 
06:27:34.750 --> 06:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
particular provision uh department does
 
06:27:37.150 --> 06:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
have laws that require proactive notice
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
and posters um on other provisions of
 
06:27:43.868 --> 06:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
the law like pay Equity um uh benefits
 
06:27:46.150 --> 06:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
um veteran services there's a few more
 
06:27:56.230 --> 06:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:59.830 --> 06:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
there no more questions exhausted oh
 
06:28:01.390 --> 06:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
you've got one more thought you say
 
06:28:02.910 --> 06:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking all right go for it thank
 
06:28:05.230 --> 06:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
you um so the a automatic service charge
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
would that that fall under your purview
 
06:28:12.390 --> 06:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
because given that this might be kept as
 
06:28:15.708 --> 06:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
a tip on the from the employer side or
 
06:28:18.150 --> 06:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
how would you guys look at that is is if
 
06:28:19.708 --> 06:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
an automatic service charges for the use
 
06:28:21.590 --> 06:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
of a credit card compared to an
 
06:28:23.468 --> 06:28:23.478 align:start position:0%
automatic service charge for a wedding
 
06:28:24.468 --> 06:28:24.478 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
100 yeah it's an excellent question uh
 
06:28:28.788 --> 06:28:28.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bit of a hypothetical um
 
06:28:30.468 --> 06:28:30.478 align:start position:0%
because similar I mean this would be
 
06:28:35.390 --> 06:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a a novel law a novel situation
 
06:28:37.070 --> 06:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
um I think ostensibly the department
 
06:28:38.830 --> 06:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
would be involved if the automatic
 
06:28:41.750 --> 06:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
service charge um disclosed certain
 
06:28:43.628 --> 06:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
allocations of that charge that were
 
06:28:47.548 --> 06:28:47.558 align:start position:0%
then not Faithfully followed or I think
 
06:28:50.468 --> 06:28:50.478 align:start position:0%
likely in our context if if it said that
 
06:28:52.430 --> 06:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
you know 75% of the service charge goes
 
06:28:54.270 --> 06:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
to tips and it turns out 75% of the
 
06:28:55.750 --> 06:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
charge didn't go to tips but it could
 
06:28:58.270 --> 06:28:58.280 align:start position:0%
lead to some some enforcement action and
 
06:29:01.708 --> 06:29:01.718 align:start position:0%
a followup please where would you find
 
06:29:04.390 --> 06:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
that would it be an an employer policy
 
06:29:06.350 --> 06:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be is it is it in statute
 
06:29:08.430 --> 06:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else that that a service judge
 
06:29:11.990 --> 06:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be broken down statutorily or
 
06:29:14.708 --> 06:29:14.718 align:start position:0%
um at just through employment if the
 
06:29:16.750 --> 06:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
employee says I give 50% of it to my
 
06:29:18.590 --> 06:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
employees how do you how would you guys
 
06:29:21.270 --> 06:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
be able to track that uh the only place
 
06:29:22.990 --> 06:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
it would appear in statute is if this
 
06:29:24.670 --> 06:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
passed and and this were added to the
 
06:29:27.030 --> 06:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
law um how would we track it we'd have
 
06:29:29.070 --> 06:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
to look at business records and records
 
06:29:31.190 --> 06:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
of the employee or sorry employer to
 
06:29:32.510 --> 06:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
determine how it was allocated and how
 
06:29:35.030 --> 06:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
it was paid and
 
06:29:37.070 --> 06:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
final would that would that open them up
 
06:29:40.230 --> 06:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
to a larger OB obviously audit it could
 
06:29:42.150 --> 06:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean depend the audits are very
 
06:29:44.708 --> 06:29:44.718 align:start position:0%
fact specific it it very it depends very
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
much on what the facts of the complaint
 
06:29:48.270 --> 06:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
are what the allegations are we are
 
06:29:53.628 --> 06:29:53.638 align:start position:0%
limited in our scope under 273 9A um
 
06:29:56.670 --> 06:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
but often time investigations beget
 
06:29:58.750 --> 06:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
additional allegations as as we talk to
 
06:30:02.070 --> 06:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
more to more employees thank you thank
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr good good question have cine
 
06:30:06.070 --> 06:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:30:08.030 --> 06:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
my question so I I'm hearing a lot about
 
06:30:10.150 --> 06:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
service charges is there a definition in
 
06:30:11.948 --> 06:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor that actually
 
06:30:13.590 --> 06:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
qualifies what a SE or service charge
 
06:30:15.670 --> 06:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
can be charged or any definition of it
 
06:30:18.270 --> 06:30:18.280 align:start position:0%
at all not under current law up until a
 
06:30:20.830 --> 06:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
couple years ago the the term service
 
06:30:23.628 --> 06:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
charge was within uh the definition of a
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
tip actually which led to a lot of
 
06:30:26.830 --> 06:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
confusion because said that a tip can be
 
06:30:29.430 --> 06:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
a service charge um so not currently
 
06:30:34.548 --> 06:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:36.830 --> 06:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
